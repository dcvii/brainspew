Finally a smart question about the terror tunnels for once.

As an IDF Major who led the operations to find and destroy a couple I’m qualified to answer that.

Here's an actual moment of one of those being destroyed.

The "tailings," or debris from the Gaza tunnels, are disposed of in several ways to avoid detection from the air.

Hamas employs various methods to conceal the excavated material:

- On-site Camouflage: The sand and rubble are often spread out thinly over a wide area, making the change in ground level difficult to spot from above. The material's light color often blends in with the natural sandy terrain of Gaza.
- Recycling and Reuse: A significant portion of the excavated material is reused for other construction projects. This can include mixing the sand and rubble into concrete to build more tunnels or using it as a foundation for buildings.
- Concealed Disposal Sites: The debris is sometimes moved to concealed locations, such as inside buildings, under gardens, or in areas with heavy civilian foot traffic and construction where the debris blends in. The tunnel entry points are often located inside private homes, mosques, greenhouses, storage facilities or other civilian structures, which provides a natural cover for the disposal of tailings. The entry points are usually there as well.

Israel's ability to detect these tunnels from the air is a complex challenge, despite having advanced aerial surveillance. The primary reasons why the tailings are not easily visible are:

- Visual Concealment: The methods of disposal are specifically designed to make the tailings blend in with the environment, making them difficult to distinguish from natural land features or general construction debris.
- Technological Limitations: While Israel uses advanced technologies like Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Lidar, which can detect subtle changes in ground elevation and density, these technologies are not foolproof. The geology of the Gaza Strip, which is composed of soft sedimentary rocks, makes it challenging to differentiate between natural and man-made subsurface voids. The depth and narrowness of the tunnels also make them hard to detect.
- Human Intelligence: The detection of tunnels is a combination of technology and human intelligence. The lack of visible tailings from the air requires Israeli forces to rely heavily on intelligence from the ground to locate and destroy the tunnels.

In general, as much as many keyboard generals tell you otherwise, there is no replacement for the ground maneuver.

See how much effort and resources Hamas put in to continue killing. All of this came at the expense of Gazans, but blame Israel, it's the trendy thing to do these days.

If Hamas remains withing 5 years the same thing will happen again. All the aid and all the concrete would go underground. Some of it though, will get to billionaire terrorists. Life in Qatar ain't cheap.
