### On MDX, Briefly

I've worked with MSAS a bit and I've had engineers who worked for me tell me things that confirm my brief experiences as I got further from the technology.

Most people who get up the rather steep curve for MDX admire it for its elegance and prefer it to SQL on that basis. Nevertheless the experience is that it is generally not worth it to learn the language if you have appreciable experience in SQL.

If you have become something of an expert in tuning databases in the generations of products before the Greenplum and Vertica days, say with Essbase, Microstrategy, Teradata, Oracle Express or Sybase ASE, then you will have some familiarity with arcane 4G languages and dialects of SQL without many cross-product similarities. MDX was the language destined to solve all that, a sort of OLAP Esperanto. Unfortunately, the number of programmers deciding to hack SQL to perform against this and that sort of schema tended to dominate the few cross-platform specialists. In the end, it is my opinion that the lack of a predominating visualization stack obviated the need for widespread MDX adoption. As fat visual programming OLAP clients matured, enterprise customers began demanding thin clients. As full featured stacks became available, developers wanted LAMP, and so on. Now we are met on a battlefield testing whether PHP and MySQL will long endure, with people like me wondering how they ever got started considering the maturity and performance of products like Sybase and Essbase.

My direct experience is that flatly, for applications of any sophistication, on MSAS, stored procedures with T-SQL always performed better than their functional equivalents in MDX. In their aborted product stack, Performance Point, Microsoft engineers created a middle language PEL(?) that would supposedly choose which language was best suited for a task and then generate that code. All jokes about code-generators aside, my engineers always had to second guess PEL and ended up writing it all in T-SQL. So as a practical matter, there was no sense in learning MDX if you had already mastered T-SQL on the platform for which MDX was specifically designed. It would have been nice if MDX performed with speed commensurate with its elegance, but it simply didn't. This was two years ago.

I know MDX lives on in Essbase but that Essbase expresses it differently than does MSAS. It does rather boil down to 'it depends', because language to language different platforms have different strengths, etc.

I expect that we will not learn the definitive answer to this question until there is a shakeout of DBs that survive the transition to cloud infrastructure. And in that regard I think a Greenplum or a Vertica or a Hadoop-based solution will win out. In other words it won't come down to the semantic layer. The market never forced it to because there is no real OLAP standard (chicken or egg?).

In the end I say MDX iff you love MDX.

### ODTUG Followup #1

I'm still very busy kicking off a new project and haven't had much time to spare but I did want to do a short follow-up.

First, thanks to everyone who showed up at my session. It was very gratifying to see a packed room. I hope the lesson in data management was valuable to you. And as I promised, I will be publishing parts of the toolkit shortly. I will do a separate post for each of the four tools I talked about and I will be replicating those over at the IN2HYPERION site as well. So you need to check there as well.

  

Secondly, it was great, as usual to see my old friends and colleagues and meet new people face to face. Kathy Horton, Jon Rambeau, Mike McCarty, Ed Roske (whom I didn't get a chance to speak to but lobbed a softball question), Mark Rittman, Tim Tow, Rohit Amarnath, Yuri from Brooklyn, Rudy Zucca, Eric Helmer, Andrea, Ron Moore, Rob Donohue, Doug Burke, Sean Bernhoit & Darin Pope.

  

More blogging this weekend. Stay tuned.

### Get In2Hyperion + Cloud Battles

There's a new blog on the block. Just a bit of horn-tooting. Please notice. It's called [In2Hyperion](https://web.archive.org/web/20211028043625/http://www.in2hyperion.com/). It's put together by the good, smart folks at Rolta TUSC and I expect that it will reward your attention.

  

What's new with me? Well, I think it is inevitable that we're all going to get into big data, and big data is all going to live in the clouds. The coming battle, as I see it, is going to be the super IT folks vs the super cloud folks. It's a showdown that has been long brewing. There are going to be winners and losers, and the ultimate winners will be companies.

  

The super cloud folks are those old heads who have had to work with massive scalability of the sort the most successful websites have had to use. The super IT folks are those old head who have had basically to manage outsourcing, capital budgets, traditional IT, and of course big ERP and big DW. If you ask me, they are two radically different perspectives with few skillsets that overlap. Here's an example.

  

This week on Cranky Geeks, the cranks assembled had the nerve to suggest that Oracle bought Sun merely to destroy MySQL, and that if the world has any justice then some anti-trust agency is going to force Oracle to give it up. I really, really think that's a laughable criticism. That's because I firmly believe that Oracle wonks have absolutely zero to fear from MySQL because it doesn't scale. Now I'm just going to accept that as axiomatic, because obviously some guys somewhere have figured out how to do some masterful multi-tiering perhaps with Hadoop or some-such. And yes there is this thing stuck in my head about hearing that a lot of web folks think that a million rows in MySQL is 'very large'. So I'll admit the prejudice. But here's what I understand very clearly about Oracle, they will not kill things that refuse to die especially when there's market share at stake.  

  

On the other hand, it's difficult for me to believe that Facebook is running on Oracle behind the scenes. These web jockeys know \*something\*. Which is why there is a war coming for the enterprise dollar.  

My interpretation of the **Oracle Sun acquisition** is that Oracle is going to have its own hardware and will get into the cloud business ultimately. That will leave HP to buy SAP or vice-versa. IBM will face its greatest challenge in five to seven years. There will be other players - likely Cisco if you ask me, but the great irony is that Scott McNeely's prediction (The Network is the Computer) will finally come true, except that he won't be running the company that realizes it. Intel will probably get into the cloud data center business fabbing up custom stuff rather like whomever used to make those big switches for AT&T way back in the day. BTW, there's a great scene of a switch in THX 1138 (minute 62).

The advantage the cloud and web-guys have is that they know how to build for scale. The disadvantage is that most of their data is pretty dumb and they're not particularly interested in applying rules and discipline to it. That's the huge difference, from my way of looking at things, between corporate IT data and public web data. So the gap that needs to be filled, which may auger for a real evolution in enterprise computing is the judicious migration of critical applications to utility computing.  
  
Imagine this. Oracle drops off a [containerized data center](https://web.archive.org/web/20211028043625/http://www.sun.com/products/sunmd/s20/) at your company's data center. They hook up power and network and in a short time several of your applications have been ported over. The container hooks up to a truck and off it goes to Oracle's grid. You shut down your data center and never worry about capital expense again.  
  
Agent Smith says it is inevitable.  

### Countdown to the Purge

Well, it just seems that the more I look at this stimulus package the more I find to dislike. But I am looking at the way it may affect my particular industry. I just discovered today a nice hunk of smelly protectionism, that will serve to benefit the American IT industry just fine - well, depending on how you look at it.

  

The bottom line is that [a big splash of cold water](https://web.archive.org/web/20211028043625/https://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9127979) is going to be thrown on H1-B visas. What you have here is a political compromise that changes the rules of the game with some politically correct exceptions for cover.

  

One thing we know in IT and especially in IT consulting is that labor markets move very quickly and talent is at a worldwide premium. That's why we have so many folks from all over the world employed in this business. Any old Joe won't do. I could get into the particulars about my segment of the industry and my opinions about outsourcing and staff augmentation. Suffice it to say that it's very easy to stereotype a lot of Indian workers. But the fact is that Indians who make up a visible bulk of guest workers are all over the map in terms of talent. That doesn't matter as we throw the baby out with the bathwater here.

  

This is just another zero-sum, wealth transferring, centrally planned wrecking ball headed at the economy. Unintended consequences? Yeah right.

### Microsoft PPS: Dead.

[Nigel Pendse reports](https://web.archive.org/web/20211028043625/http://www.olapreport.com/Comment_Bizdemise.htm) the death of Microsoft Performance Point Server:

> Despite all the positive auguries, it seems that PerformancePoint Planning has flopped.  
> Microsoft announced on January 23 that it was to be discontinued. There will be a final SP3 Planning release in mid 2009 to deal with immediate customer issues, but no further enhancements. It is possible that some planning functionality will be added into other Microsoft products, such as Analysis Services and Excel, but this will not be based on the abandoned PerformancePoint Planning product.  
> The Biz# project will have run for almost six years from commencement to abandonment, with little to show for it apart from some disappointed customers and partners.

Disappointment indeed. It's now official. I can say with finality that I wasted a year in my career. In fact, a lot of good people that I know personally wasted a year and even longer chasing the rainbow that was Microsoft Performance Point Server. It's a damned shame because some very smart people worked very hard and some hard earned money turned out to be a bad investment. I personally know people who went halfway around the world trying to make Microsoft PPS do what it was supposed to do. It's not just the clients of Madoff who are pissed these days.

I was fortunate to get hit over the head with a brick almost exactly a year ago when my boss made the judicious decision to trim his sails and begin cutting his losses in an ambitious project to corner the consulting market on PPS. We were the consulting vendor of choice. We proved that we could do things with that product that almost nobody else could and we survived on hope, skill and the kind of gallows humor dedication of the dogfaced GI.

There were several occasions when I had to stop and scratch my head wondering if it was just me or were we pushing ropes. But I'm no quitter. If there was a way to make that stuff work, we were going to do it. Now what I remember of the story can be told.

First of all, PPS was a decent product. It had particular strengths and weaknesses that you might expect from a version one launch, but in my revised opinion - the kind of opinion I could afford to develop after I left the team, there were certain things that simply doomed it. Only one of them had to do with the technology.

The first and foremost thing that doomed PPS was that it was a Microsoft product and what I learned was that Microsoft, certainly as far as PPS was concerned and probably in general is a technology company, not a product company. That is to say that Microsoft is the kind of company that is well suited to marshal its resources on a global scale with a large existing installed base of interlocking technologies but that ability doesn't scale down. Microsoft is incapable of profiting from small products with small markets, and from a Microsoft perspective PPS was tiny.

Secondly PPS itself belonged to nobody. Not that there were 'nobodies' in charge of it. In fact there were multiple big somebodies in charge of various parts of it. There lies the problem; there simply was not one integrated product organization that could make decisions in support of the product and then stand behind those decisions internally to Microsoft or externally to consultants and customers. PPS primarily belonged to 'OBA', the guys responsible for Microsoft Office. Now I know BPM people are saying what!?. I did too, but that's the way it went. PPS also depended on Excel, which was another group. PPS also depended on SharePoint which was another group. And of course it depended on SQL Server & Analysis Services, yet another group. So who coordinated all of those development efforts? Effectively nobody.

Thirdly PPS had no product roadmap. The product roadmap for PPS was basically a function of sales. We throw it out there to 50,000 customers, we expect an adaptation rate of 3% at a price of X per pop, there's your revenue stream. Completely absent from that was a feedback loop. Microsoft didn't care a hoot about what customers and developers might have to say about the product's features or shortcomings. It was as if a mighty focus group or marketing exec had spoken and that was the end of it. So when things went wrong, and believe me a lot of things went wrong, there was no recourse. So nobody inside or outside of Microsoft, situated to support the product knew if, for example, there would be a published API for the product. Nobody knew if there was actually going to be a next release or what the priofities might be in that release. For all the things we knew that worked or didn't work internally to the product, we would be stuck telling our customers - well we don't really know when Microsoft is going to address that. In fact, we didn't even know IF Microsoft was going to address that.

Fourth. PPS just didn't perform. I had guys working the guts of this product and one of the things that was entirely too clever about it was that it had a kind of code generator that would determine whether or not it would use MDX or T-SQL to execute its functions. I don't recall what people have said about how well optimized Microsoft compilers are, but obviously none of those geniuses worked on optimizing PPS. PPS would generate a meta-language that was basically full of crap. Our guys were hand-coding all of the internals and forcing the product to use SQL instead of MDX, period. It was the only way to get it performing worth beans.

I recall a famous meeting I had up in Redmond with some really sharp guys that Microsoft had redeployed from FRX to get on the PPS bandwagon. I didn't like it because it meant that Microsoft was hedging on us as a consulting vendor, but we all figured that the market would eventually take care of us all so we played nice. One of the top three PPS architects in the world was there explaining and demonstrating one of the few successful internal implementations. As we went through the demo the architect did a drilldown in Excel. You know me, I counted seconds for response time...6..7..8..9..10. After about 12 seconds we got about 50 rows of data. Let me make that clear, 50 rows with 12 columns, 600 freaking cells. This, I know because I asked, was coming off of a 64bit server. Anybody with any experience in OLAP knows that kind of performance was unacceptable back in 1992. At the time of this meeting, there was only one person who actually had any experience doing any back-end tuning behind PPS. All I could say was, well, FRX has done well in the mid-market, so maybe this isn't so bad. But I knew from that moment on that it would be a cold day in hell before we could beat Oracle, Cognos or even Outlooksoft for Enterprise customers.

And yet Microsoft people had the nerve to believe that their entry into the market - their purchase of ProClarity was this fearsome move that \*prompted\* Oracle to buy Hyperion and IBM to buy Cognos. Unbelievable.

I have to say in retrospect, that PPS was the crappiest product I've ever had to work with for its market. ProClarity was 3 times better by itself. ProClarity as a company may have been destroyed here, but there's an object lesson that the brains behind ProClarity and the organization was much better suited to manage that product than Microsoft. I've come to terms with my frustration with Microsoft. I don't hate them, but I understand why people hate them. I have never, in my entire career, had customers so furious at me for a failure to deliver on promises implicit in a product. I have never seen smart consultants so frustrated by a product's complexity and poor performance. I have never seen businessmen have to tapdance so fiercely to keep everybody on the same page.

I've learned a great deal about Microsoft, people and myself through my experience with PPS. I can say this. When it comes to delivering products and services to the enterprise, Microsoft is better to have as an enemy than as a partner.

To all my friends and associates in Redmond and Century City, to all of my customers and partners in Washginton, Arizona, Oregon and Hong Kong, you know I have great respect and admiration for your courage under fire. I'm sorry to have failed you. I did all that I could, but now you know that Microsoft just didn't back us up.

Now there's somebody who I have to buy a cow.

### Star May Have Done It Again

In my aging and occasionally useless universe of computing, there are several important galaxies. The most important is the BI galaxy, which is alternately called the DW and the BPM galaxy. That's the one that pays my bills, and with any luck will get my brats through college. In that galaxy are several stars that I pay attention to although there may be others that are brighter and more massive. I try to get into their orbits when I can.

Among those stars are Applied Olap, Tableau and Star Analytics - some of the brightest people in the Essbase Quadrant. Folks who still build products have my admiration.

  

Here at the NorCal OAUG I've seen some familiar faces from Star Analytics.I just happened by Suzanne Hoffman, who keeps track of all of my favorite people and Quinlan Eddy, one of the guys who taught me Essbase. They are If my guess is correct, he's done it again. Within a few hours I'll know for sure, but he may have just short-circuited my little big idea for the year, which has to do with the automation of back-end processes that feed Hyperion apps. I'll get a demo later and post what I can post.

### The Death of DRM

It took about ten years but it looks as if the death of DRM is pretty much done. Thank God that's over.  

The bell started tolling yesterday as Apple declared that the iTunes store is changing its pricing and removing DRM from here on out. That's superb news, but I think that it was Amazon's MP3, DRM free store which truly signalled the beginning of the end. For the past two months or so, I've basically done all my music downloads from Amazon MP3, which while not as slick as iTunes is faster to find a song.

  

All of this change reminds me of what may yet be now that these cats are out of the bag. Which is to say, what about Torrents?

  

Once upon a time I tried doing that P2P thing. I don't think I stopped for a good long time. What I found was a whole lot of low quality labeling, odd versions of songs and very little of what I really wanted, especially when it came to classical and jazz. I still have multiple versions of songs in my reasonable good sized library at 96Kbps which indicate to me that I got them from one of the old P2P sources. I was a member of eMusic. I toyed with Shoutcast and of course used Winamp for a long time. WinMX was my P2P client but after a while their servers became too slow and unreliable. I'm sure I was done with it by 2002 or so - but certainly starting in 98 a good 10-20% of my MP3 library was gotten through P2P, the rest through ripping my own CDs.

  

Interestingly enough the songs I got P2P were songs that I simply couldn't bear to by the album for, like one or two cuts from Blink 182 or the Offspring. Remember those guys? Yep. I still have it at 128. Title 'Keep em Separated'. But the real name of the song is Come Out and Play. I didn't know until I got the disk some time later. These were the pop songs that I had to have and that I think the industry made the biggest fuss about - the same sorts that kid hackers were interested in.

  

In fact now that I think about it, the last songs I P2P'd were those from Soul Coughing back in the days they were all that. I probably went through three or four generations of trying to get their stuff before I gave up and found the CDs. The lessons were learned. P2P was for geeks with no money and lots of patience. When it came to good music, I could come up with the buck - for the pop crap, I'd take the P2P version.  
  
Anyway, I'm on the verge of setting up some multiple servers at Vault 107 (The new name, following Fallout, of my at home IT) one of which is going to be a media server. The lack of DRM is useful just for my own peace of mind. I've got three kids buying music from iTunes and some of that could be simplified. But I'm really interested in the implications of being able to have that kind of dedicated server and now sticking a Torrent client/server type of deally there. For me, I'd certainly want that to be a secured circle of trust for my family rather than a defiant Pirate Bay sort of joint.  
  
It does finally come down to money and whether or not business are smart enough to figure out a business plan with the masses that is adequately profitable \*and\* accessible. The music market has always been a mass market which was always profitable enough to be DRM free, it's just that in the days of Kazaa and prior, a larger percentage of the market was 'hack capable', and this grated on producers nerves. But a large part of the animosity between this small hack capable community, which was essentially all of Computer Science and IT, was generated because of the perception that these grungy Dot Commers were going to eat the entire lunch of old media - and through the entire irrational exuberence of the era, there was reason to believe they were right. Instead it turns out that only somebody like Steve Jobs could make the right product and that he could do so without being the sort of pompous ass that Shawn Fanning was. In the end, Fanning got millions, but not billions and it was the hedge against the possibility of a Fanning like character eating some company like Viacom that created the legal fudge and farce that is now the legacy of RIAA's bitchslapping Congress into complicit submission.  
  
It wasn't really until iTunes exploded the market base with a user friendly interface and kids like mine started trading iTunes music gift cards, that the mass market grew enough with a large enough balance of 'hack incapable' consumers that the economicsof DRM-free digital music made sense enough to back off the legal horse. This is the market teaching a lesson that the DRM hardliners can now easily learn. Let's not forget how many Groksters have gone bust before now. But I think it is also the buildout of VOD and the big fat price elasticity of digital last mile triple-play which has emerged over the past couple years that is making the industry turn the corner.  
  
I should also say that without Netflix and Gamefly, the entire on-demand model would not have emerged. Those two companies have shown that digital distribution on a subscriber basis can be profitable. The DRM dependence of both models, I think, is a bit overstated. I think that the simple fact is that they proved that the market would scale up larger than big media companies thought on-demand would go. In other words, the VOD buildout by big media companies with or without DRM would not have happened had Netflix and Gamefly not proved something. Yes it's true that video arcades are a thing of the past, but that really was a long time coming.  
  
As for the XBox, Microsoft found a very good pricing model that didn't have to change. For a $300 box, and a $50 annual subscription rate online interactive gaming was always a bargain, even on $60 titles. That is simply because it's worth $60 to get 60 hours (at least) on online interactive gaming, which is actually a lot cheaper than your WoW style PC games. The upside of hacking an XBox was not value, simply geek appeal, whereas the upside of getting the latest Blink 182 single for free against the cost of a CD was big.  
  
People also forget that there are a lot of 'hack capable' ways of getting DRM free music that have been grandfathered into other deals. I could get a high quality audio feed from my cable TV's 200 music channels and rip thousands of MP3s without running afoul of any law.  
  
I, for one, support digital watermarking. Even in a DRM-free world, like the open source world, there should be some easy way to get a certifiable product. I would even support a third party service that would plug-in to a good music or video player. I'd actually pay more for a multimedia client that accommodates such a validation service. But anything that limits my ability to take my collection of digital content anywhere for any reason for the rest of my life? Niente!  
  
I don't suppose I could complete this matter without talking about podcasts and Tivo. The habits of the new generation of digital entertainment consumption are set. The genius of Brandon Tartikoff is a thing of the past. It doesn't much matter what time things are scheduled to be delivered, so long as enough people know that it's coming and it's in-season. The other form of this, by the way, are boxed-sets. So long as I can get a 'boxed-set' of any serial content, its value changes. Companies understood this with regard to movies 10 years ago which is why the accounting of 'ultimates' came into practice. 'Ultimates' accounting value content products based on current and residual cashflows, plus as an asset. I haven't looked at that part of the industry in a while, but I don't think that was a mistake. Podcasts enable not only a long tail, but a longer asset value - so does the Netflix library. But the primary change is that the consumer wants control of where and when. Indefinitely. In other words, the consumer wants all entertainment content in their own cloud and they want it available on demand.  
  
Guys in the software business, like me, understand this. And we sit and watch as it take multiple combinations of companies with small parts of small business models do bits of the big picture over multiple years. It's going to eventually go our way. Why? Because we build the technology.  

### Where Should BI Go Next?

I think of BI as reaching a point at which it can become a great deal more flexible in terms of deployment. The question isn't so much which industry, nor even so much and certainly not why. Rather, I still think the major goal is pervasive BI and broadly applied across functions. "Mashup BI".

Simply stated, 10 years ago, people were asking some of these same questions about the web. Today we take it for granted that one can and should use a combination of websites to create a mosaic of information attending to your concerns. BI has lagged in this pervasive quality.

From a management perspective, I should use BI to focus my employees' attentions on those goals that I perceive coming from internal and external change. My BI platform should serve the purposes of rapid development and integration of these changes. Somehow we have not processed numbers, even given our longevity in the industry better than the web has managed text. Nor have we managed scalability in the database arena as well when it comes to BI - which is a very odd thing considering that we should be first. Yet more data is processed through company websites, especially ecommerce, than through company BI, and BI customers still fuss about performance.

I think this is a consequence of focusing too tightly on single BI applications rather than the entire scope of what company management does to focus the attention of their employees into a measurable performance discipline. If a company is providing access to company information without adding a measurable discipline (or one that is self-evident) then they are wasting employee's time and compute resources. My BI dashboard and internal communications should be every bit as intriguing as what's going on at Twitter. If your company is using Websense, in that regard you're already too late. You're not making the company's business interesting and exciting to your own employees.

Granted this requires a cultural adjustment, but the technology should not be an excuse and we in the profession need to work towards making analytic ubiquity possible at reasonable costs.

Ultimately I think there will emerge higher level abstracts which will obviate some aspects of the scratch building we do today, though the need will continue. You don't see much tweaking in Point of Sale Systems in Retail. It's done - a register is a register. Soon, an accounting department will be similarly commodified as well as all of the standard KPIs necessary. Then restaurant inventories with KPIs regarding the turnover differences between fish and cheese and one with popular wines, linked to afficionado ratings. It's time to start thinking at the next level of business performance abstraction. This requires that BI be strategic - that it be the end vision of capturing and focusing the attention of every employee in every department that has a computer on driving business performance.

### Possible Good News for Rolta India

From the [Barnett](https://web.archive.org/web/20211028043625/http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/2008/09/congress_should_approve_indian.html):

> Congress should approve Indian nuke deal WORLD NEWS: "Bush to Press Nuclear Deal With India," by Jay Solomon and Niraj Sheth, Wall Street Journal, 8 September 2008, p. A12. ARTICLE: "After Georgia: After Georgia's defeat, the West struggles to deal with a newly belligerent Russia," The Economist, 23 August 2008, p. 41.
> 
> I'm for any strategic deals that bring us closer to India and any deals that make nuclear power more accessible and less frightening. Plus U.S. companies like Boeing and Lockheed need the access to markets.
> 
> Plus, with the Bush administration killing the proposed nuclear cooperation deal with Russia, effectively denying its atomic industry billions of dollars of market opportunity, the timing couldn't be better in terms of the message delivered: behave well and this is the kind of rewards you can expect and vice versa.
> 
> So I'm all for Congress approving this, and believe Bush and Rice's State Department deserve credit on this one.

### BI Clouds

Unlike many of my new midwestern colleagues, I spend a lot of time missing planes. In fact, because of a 30 minute delay in Indianapolis yesterday, I won't be able to get home to Los Angeles until about 6pm tonight. Bad luck piles up over time, an early start beats fast running.

So while it might not seem like such a big deal to you, I'm wondering why more companies have not invested in BI clouds. I asked a few folks over the past week and got some blank stares when I talked about cloud computing related to MobileMe. But I hope that will not long be the case, especially as it is clear that Rolta (my new Daddy) is seriously invested in SOA, CA Unicenter type controls, Managed Services and Hosting. It's just a matter of time before it becomes clear that there are a lot of candidate companies for some extraordinarily nice IT around EPM and BI. The sooner the better. Any delay now may keep the whole industry stumbling.

It's all next to impossible to get people in corporate IT to stick to some standards established by the know-it-alls. And I must confess that I've spent a whole lot of time just learning exactly how many PM Methodologies are inferior to the sort Leah Wheelan got us working on a decade ago in AFSG. But the hub and spoke and active data warehouse and Agile JADs can only go so far - that is until you move to the next customer who wants to do it their way. Knowing this, I like most folks haven't even bothered much to listen to the know-it-alls. I mean how many projects have been delayed because the customer says 'yeah we need MDM but nobody wants to pay for it, besides, we've got deadlines'. Meanwhile the hierarchy gets rejects every pass and people invent department codes at will.

Such things would be eliminated by a company that hosts EPM - because we would own the standards, and the hardware, and the network and the security, and before you get into our heavenly cloud, St Peter would make sure you had your master data in order.

I've been thinking about hosted BI since 2003, not that me thinking about it matters much. But I think I've finally found some folks who can and will step up to make that kind of service offering a reality. As with most things, I remain cautiously optimistic and keep asking 'what can go wrong'. As the business case is made or not, I will report.
