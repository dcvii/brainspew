More, as Kingsley Amis foresaw in 1960, has meant worse. After years of rapid expansion, which have taken the proportions of young people in college to unprecedented heights, higher education is in crisis throughout the English-speaking world. On this side of the Atlantic, a significant number of universities are staring bankruptcy in the face. In real terms, funding is down by nearly a third since tuition fees were raised to £9,000 back in 2012. Four Russell Group universities — Cardiff, Durham, Newcastle and Sheffield — are laying off lecturers to try to balance their books.

On the other side of the pond, America’s much wealthier colleges are on a collision course with the newly elected administration of [Donald Trump](https://www.thetimes.com/topic/donald-trump) — a collision they have brought upon themselves by years of overt left-wing political activism. Federal funding looks set to be slashed, the generous tax treatment of endowments to be challenged. And everywhere in the Anglophone world, students and recent graduates are weighed down by debt they incurred for degrees that employers view with scepticism — not to mention a double pandemic of mental ill-health and what Richard Dawkins called the woke “mind virus”.

In Britain, even the longest-established and wealthiest institutions are in trouble. Despite the staringly obvious problems that programmes to promote “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion” have caused at the Ivy League universities, the University of Oxford’s leadership seems intent on going down the same path to perdition. It is astonishing, after all the lunacy we have seen in the elite US colleges in the past year and a half, that Oxford employs 59 staff in DEI roles, at a cost of £2.5 million before pensions and benefits. Even more baffling, given the dire state of the university finances, is the 20 per cent increase in DEI staff nationwide since 2022. (UK bureaucrats prefer EDI. I prefer DIE, because that is what the institutions that go down this path will ultimately do.)
