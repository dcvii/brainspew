## 150 Essential Sci-Fi Movies to Watch Now

There’s only one place where you can get clones, time travel, simulated realities, irradiated and irritated giant lizards, and space fights and beyond. (Maybe not all at once, but we can dream.) Anything’s possible in this creative nebula known as science fiction, and with its long and historic association with cinema, we present our choices of the greatest science-fiction movies ever: The 150 Essential Sci-Fi Movies!

As they do with horror, filmmakers use science fiction to reflect our aspirations, terrors, and issues of the times. Through genre lens, we can consider our impact on the environment (*Godzilla*, *WALL-E*), technology gone berserk (*The Terminator*, *Ex Machina*), identity (*Blade Runner*, *The Matrix*), and societal breakdowns (*Children of Men*, *A Clockwork Orange*). We might even check-in on the current state of the human condition (*Gattaca*, *Her*).

Or, maybe we just want to see giant ants wreak havoc across the neighborhood. There may not be a lot of subtext in a big monster movie like *Them!*, or even crowd-pleasing masterpieces like *Star Wars* or *Back to the Future*, but they speak to the one thing that attracts us to movies in the first place: escapism. Science-fiction movies are our tickets to planets far-away (*Star Trek*, *Avatar*, *Starship Troopers*), or a quick hop to a local joint in the solar system (*The Martian*, *Total Recall*). They take us just above the atmosphere (*Gravity*), deep down to the bottom of the ocean (*20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*, *The Abyss*), and into the human body (*Fantastic Voyage*). Limited only 2020by imagination, sci-fi inspires wonder, awe, terror, and hope for alternative mindsets and better futures.

Sci-fi spreads across subgenres, all represented here: the monster movie (*Cloverfield*), space opera (*Serenity*), cyberpunk (*Ghost in the Shell*), and post-apocalyptic (*Mad Max: Fury Road*) and more. Or it can fuse onto traditional genres like drama (*Donnie Darko*, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*), comedy (*Repo Man*, *Idiocracy*), and action (*Predator*, *Demoliton Man*). Wherever the destination, these movies — each with at least 20 reviews — were selected because of their unique, fun, and possibly even mind-blowing spins on reality.

It’s time to strap in and cue the Theremin for some of the best science-fiction films created: Time to launch the 150 Essential Sci-Fi Movies! **()**

## Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959) 66%
