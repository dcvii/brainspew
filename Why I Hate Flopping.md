### And not just in sports

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hxj6!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c61c5e3-6fb9-4817-b63f-abc0ced81e78_1057x352.png)

When I first started playing basketball, there was no flopping. It didn’t exist. I never saw it. I never even heard it mentioned.

Flops back then were on Broadway. Not in Madison Square Garden.

But nowadays, the flop is as common on the hardwood as three-point shots and goofy mascots. Just lay a finger on a NBA star, and he drops like a bowling pin.

Here’s what it looks like:

I hear people claim that flopping existed in the NBA back in the 1960s—but they can’t actually produce film footage to prove it. Sure, players tried to get fouls called in their favor, and would lie and cheat if necessary. But they would never engage in the theatrical pratfalls of today.

A flopper would have been mocked endlessly, even by teammates. Anyone who continued making these slapstick falls would get laughed out of the league.

That’s because the ethos in sports was the exact opposite of flopping. Athletes were expected to act as if they were immune to pain. No matter how hard you got hit, you shook it off as if you’d been caressed with a feather duster.

You did this to intimidate your opponent.

You sent a message that you were tougher than them. Nothing they did could stop you.

The ideal was football star Jim Brown. “You get up the same each time so that the enemy don’t know when you’re hurt,” [he later explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P03SvWgFQv8). “It gives you an advantage. It’s that simple.”

But it wasn’t just Jim Brown. I saw the same macho attitude in Earl Campbell, Walter Payton, Emmitt Smith, Barry Sanders, and other NFL stars. The same was true in the NBA back then. Players like Wilt and Kareem always kept a poker face, never revealing any pain or hint of weakness.

Did Michael Jordan ever flop? Check out this video.

Jordan takes a mean hit from Reggie Miller at a key moment in a game. A player today would drop like a sack of potatoes. He could win the game by playacting for the ref’s attention. But that’s not Michael Jordan—he’s too busy trying to defend the shot.

In Jordan’s last play as a Chicago Bull, his opponent does fall down. But the ref ignores it. It was a different world in those days.

That was especially true on the playground. On the mean streets, intimidation was as important as shooting and dribbling.

In my teens, I played street ball every day, with the best opponents I could find. Nobody even considered flopping—there wasn’t even a word for it back then. You took your hits with a stoic guise that would make Marcus Aurelius proud.

And you certainly didn’t fall to the ground writhing in pain—unless you actually needed to go to the emergency room. Otherwise you were a *wuss.* (Does that word even exist anymore?)

I call this anti-flopping. You refuse to act hurt even when you are.

Why did this change?

That answer is simple. European players brought the flop into the NBA—it was basically the same ploy they used in soccer. Now it appeared in basketball.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ml8kf3UIpN0?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe>

In an earlier day, the flop might have worked in US sports—convincing refs to give you a call. But nobody dared try it, simply because there would have been so much shame associated with these crybaby antics.

But the Euro players were shameless. And soon taught everybody in the league to writhe and whinge and whine.

I hate it. And not just because it’s cheating. It irks me because it runs counter to the spirit of competitive sports. It rewards a weak character and infantile behavior. And I believe sports, at its best, is more about character formation than winning.

A baby learns to pretend crying around six months—they do this to get special treatment from parents and caregivers. But the baby eventually grows up. The NBA player never does.

This might not be a big issue if flopping only happened in sports. But now it has spread everywhere. That’s because society has changed. In the current environment, everybody seeks out opportunities to exaggerate the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.

Let’s be clear: Helping victims is a good thing. We should all try to alleviate suffering. That’s one of my core values.

But what do you do when people keep *pretending* to be victims—just like those flopping NBA players. And they do it for the exact same reason. They want the rewards that come with it.

So there’s flopping in entertainment. There’s flopping in journalism. There’s flopping in politics. (Have you noticed any political leaders who constantly pretend to victimhood, despite enjoying enormous perks and privileges?) There’s flopping in business. There’s even flopping among families and friends.

And I see it every day on social media. So do you.

I know people who have enjoyed comfortable lives with ample rewards, but you would never guess it from their Facebook posts—where they complain constantly. You would think they were the title character in the *Book of Job* and already planning for a sequel*.*

But it’s all posturing.

Every day they have a new gripe. They accumulate grievances the way a chipmunk gathers nuts. And if they can’t find legit complaints, they make up phony ones.

For some reason, the algorithm likes to amplify these rants. You can even build a profitable career as an influencer (or writer, musician, artist, etc.) if you know how to play this game.

I’m probably partly to blame because I read enough of these pity party posts to ensure that I get more in the future. But it’s not just me. There’s something twisted in the human psyche that helps these harangues go viral.

What makes it even sadder is the people I know who are genuinely suffering—but would never think of posting about it online.

They’re like Jim Brown and those old school football players. Many of them use their Facebook posts to *count their blessings*, even though they face constant hardships. They hold on to the code of toughness and endurance—but in a society that no longer cares about such things.

What can we do about this?

I don’t know how to fix the algorithms on social media. But I think we could all do a better job of separating real victims and the huge number of fake ones out there—and focus our efforts more on alleviating actual suffering.

That takes discernment. But sometimes it’s easy to tell the difference—for example, when a rich Hollywood celebrity does one of these symbolic flops, while somebody in your neighborhood goes hungry.

That’s an easy call. Isn’t it?

But here’s something even easier: Lets start by signalling a new anti-flopping ethos in sports. Stop the whining. Put the floppers in their place. They belong in a crib, not on the hardwood.

All we need to do is give the refs more leeway in punishing floppers. After a few fines and suspensions, those pratfalls would go away. Maybe we would even see some of that old school toughness return.

That would send a message to the entire league. And maybe to the rest of society too.
