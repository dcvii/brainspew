There is a reason behind the madness.

This is one of the prevailing theories of what is happening:

"WHY DID THE US GOVERNMENT DECIDE TO NEGOTIATE WITH DELCY RODRIGUEZ?

1\. The power structure in Venezuela changed on Saturday, January 3, 2026. Before that date, power was divided into four main poles:

A.- Nicolás Maduro (along with Cilia Flores)

B.- Diosdado Cabello

C.- Vladimir Padrino López

D.- Delcy and Jorge Rodríguez

2.- As of Sunday, January 4, 2026, the power structure was reduced to three poles:

A.- Delcy and Jorge Rodríguez

B.- Diosdado Cabello

C.- Vladimir Padrino López

3\. Maduro's son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, as well as Cilia's children and nephews, are making great efforts to try to form a power base (to avoid being swept away as happened with Tareck El Aissami) but it will be very difficult for them to achieve it now that their parents are imprisoned in the US.

4\. To achieve the transition to democracy, the US government (Donald Trump and Marco Rubio) understands that it is necessary to carry out a negotiation process with one of the power groups in Venezuela. Negotiating with one of the three factions is not a pleasant task, but it is unavoidable.

5\. The US attempted to orchestrate the transition with Vladimir Padrino López. On more than one occasion, Donald Trump's special envoys (during both his first and second terms) offered Padrino an agreement for him to assume the presidency as soon as Maduro left power.

6\. Trump's envoys offered Padrino a deal similar to the one offered to General Augusto Pinochet in Chile. But Padrino López never honored it. On the contrary, he clung to power and betrayed the agreements he had signed with Maikel Moreno and other important figures in the ruling party.

7\. Former Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami, through his main front man, Samark López Bello, attempted to approach the US government to lead the transition as soon as Maduro left office. López spoke with opposition figures to help him gain US approval. But the US government refused. El Aissami was too closely tied to the Iranians and Hezbollah. Maduro found out about El Aissami's maneuver. The rest is history.

8\. During Juan Guaidó's interim presidency, the Donald Trump administration had a plan ready to oust Maduro. But at that time, the situation was more or less the same as it is now: Guaidó had no control or power over the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, and the US had failed to convince any of the power factions within the ruling party to agree to lead the transition.

9\. In January 2026, the situation changed: the US accepted the plan presented by the Rodríguez siblings (mediated by the Kingdom of Qatar) in late 2025 to lead the transition. The plan was simple: the US would remove Maduro, and Delcy Rodríguez would take over the Miraflores Palace. Her brother Jorge, as president of the National Assembly, would be Plan B. If anything happened to Delcy, Jorge would be ready to take over (as established by the line of succession in the Venezuelan Constitution).

10\. By removing Maduro from the equation, President Donald Trump had only 3 options:

A.- Coming to an understanding with Padrino López (ruled out, he is not trustworthy, and he had already betrayed an agreement).

B.- To deal with Mr. Cabello (Discarded)

C.- To deal with the Rodriguez brothers.

11\. Trump and Marco Rubio decided to take a gamble with the Rodríguez siblings. Delcy will assume the presidency as acting president, while her brother Jorge (the true mastermind behind the agreement) will be like a crocodile in a sewer, waiting for his opportunity to become Head of State.

12\. Nobody likes these kinds of agreements. Everyone knows who Delcy Rodríguez is, and everyone knows who Jorge Rodríguez is. The question is: were the other two options better?

13\. The important thing here is that Maduro no longer exists. Maduro is imprisoned in the US. And although the regime's structure within Venezuela remains intact (they still control everything), the dictatorship is mortally wounded and under threat. Now they know that Donald Trump is serious and that just as he sent for Maduro, tomorrow he could send for someone else.

14\. There is a negotiation underway, that's true. But the (Delcy) regime is negotiating from a position of weakness (although its speeches try to show otherwise), while Trump is negotiating from a position of strength.

15\. Delcy doesn't have it easy: on one side, she has Trump, who will pressure her to comply with the agreement. And on the other side, she has Diosdado and Padrino, who look at her askance, with contempt and distrust, because they know that just as she and her brother handed Maduro over (because they were the ones who handed him over), tomorrow they could also hand over either of them (Padrino or Diosdado) to stay in power.

16\. This movie isn't over. What we saw on Saturday, January 3rd, were just the trailers. The real movie is about to begin."
