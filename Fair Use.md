Give a brief outline of the Fair Use Doctrine as it applies to non-profit educational institutions.

The Fair Use Doctrine under U.S. copyright law (17 U.S.C. § 107) allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. For non-profit educational institutions, fair use is particularly relevant but not automatically guaranteed. It is evaluated on a case-by-case basis using four factors:
1. Purpose and Character of the Use:
	- Non-profit educational use (e.g., teaching, research, or scholarship) strongly favors fair use, especially if the use is transformative (adds new meaning or value, like analysis or commentary).
	- Commercial use or direct reproduction without added value weighs against fair use.
2. Nature of the Copyrighted Work:
	- Factual or published works (e.g., academic articles) are more likely to qualify for fair use than highly creative or unpublished works (e.g., novels or private manuscripts).
	- Educational institutions often deal with factual works, supporting fair use.
3. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used:
	- Using small, relevant excerpts (e.g., a chapter for a class) is more likely to be fair than reproducing an entire work or its "heart" (core essence).
	- Non-profits must ensure the amount used is justified for the educational purpose.
4. Effect on the Market Value:
	- Fair use is favored if the use does not harm the market for the original work (e.g., replacing sales or licensing opportunities).
	- Educational use in classrooms or limited-access platforms (e.g., course reserves) typically has minimal market impact.
Application to Non-Profit Educational Institutions:
- Classroom Use: Copying limited portions of works for teaching (e.g., handouts, slides, or digital course materials) often qualifies, especially under guidelines like the Classroom Use Guidelines (though not law, these suggest limits like 10% of a work).
- Research and Scholarship: Quoting excerpts in academic papers or presentations is generally fair, provided it’s for analysis or critique and properly cited.
- Digital Platforms: Using materials in password-protected systems (e.g., learning management systems) for enrolled students supports fair use, but public distribution may not.
- Limitations: Wholesale copying (e.g., entire textbooks), repeated use without licensing, or bypassing paywalls without permission typically violates fair use.
Key Considerations:
- Non-profits must document their fair use analysis to demonstrate good faith.
- Transformative use and minimal market harm are critical for justifying fair use.
- When in doubt, seeking permission or using public domain/open-access materials avoids risk.
