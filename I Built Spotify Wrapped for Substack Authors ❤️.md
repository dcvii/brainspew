### See how your 2025 went and how much your Substack publication evolved.

Hi there! Alejandro here 😊

We spend all year creating: content, side projects, or just putting ideas out there without thinking about them too much.

> **But we rarely pause to actually see what we built.**

When I see a Substack subscriber liking articles I wrote 6 months ago, I need 2 seconds to remember that I wrote it at all.

When I get a message on Linkedin because someone *“found me after reading X article”,* I realised about all the things you achieve that you just don’t even notice.

Life is an avalanche, we are always surrounded by FOMO, and 2025 became the year of *“if you don’t use AI you are useless”, so its hard to pause.*

> **That’s why I built Substack Wrapped 2025.**

Head to **[substackwrapped.com](https://substackwrapped.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=post)**, drop your publication URL, and you’ll see your best articles, main topics and monthly engagement evolution.

And yeah, you get a **shareable image** to post, just like Spotify Wrapped does (but without 1000 frontend engineers making frontend animations😂):

I invite you to share your downloaded image with the rest of your Substack community so other authors can reflect on their year too.

That said, thanks for all the support and get ready for a 2026 full of great content.

*Ale from The Pipe & The Line*

p.s I invite you to try it out, share-restack it with others authors that I might have forgotten to mention here 😅
