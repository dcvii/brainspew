1 Lift ev’ry voice and sing,  
till earth and heaven ring,  
ring with the harmonies of liberty.  
Let our rejoicing rise,  
high as the list’ning skies,  
let it resound loud as the rolling sea.  
Sing a song full of the faith  
that the dark past has taught us,  
Sing a song full of the hope  
that the present has brought us.  
Facing the rising sun  
of our new day begun,  
let us march on till victory is won.  

2 Stony the road we trod,  
bitter the chast’ning rod,  
felt in the days when hope unborn had died;  
Yet with a steady beat,  
have not our weary feet  
come to the place  
for which our people sighed?  
We have come over a way  
that with tears has been watered,  
we have come, treading our path  
through the blood of the slaughtered;  
Out from the gloomy past,  
till now we stand at last  
where the bright gleam  
of our bright star is cast.  

3 God of our weary years,  
God of our silent tears,  
Thou who hast brought us  
thus far on the way;  
Thou who hast by Thy might,  
led us into the light,  
keep us forever in the path, we pray.  
Lest our feet stray from the places,  
our God, where we met Thee,  
lest our hearts, drunk with the wine  
of the world, we forget Thee.  
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,  
may we forever stand,  
true to our God,  
true to our native land.
