GRAND BLANC, Mich.—A shooter left four people dead and several people injured at a church about 50 miles north of Detroit on Sunday, police said.

Hundreds of people were at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints service when a man drove through the front doors, got out of the vehicle and began firing with a rifle at 10:25 a.m. local time in Grand Blanc, Mich., said the township police chief, William Renye.

Photos from the scene showed a silver truck flying two American flags that had rammed into the church. Law-enforcement officials said they believe the gunman also set the church on fire using gasoline as an accelerant.

Police said a call came at 10:25 a.m. and 32 seconds. Officers were on the scene at 10:25 a.m. and 57 seconds. The suspect “was neutralized” at 10:33 a.m. in the church parking lot by a Department of Natural Resources officer and a Grand Blanc Township officer.

The suspect, who died, is Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40 years old, from the nearby city of Burton, Mich., police said. A Marine Corps spokesman said Sanford served from 2004 to 2008, deploying to Iraq in 2007 and 2008, and had the rank of sergeant.

He had longstanding ties to the area, and according to public records was married to a woman named Tella. They had a young son.

Two people died from gunshot wounds. Eight people remained hospitalized with gunshot injuries as of the early evening, Renye said. Seven people were in stable condition and one was in critical condition. Law-enforcement officials didn’t release the names of the victims.

First responders discovered two additional bodies in the church, Renye said later Sunday evening. They were still clearing the building, he said, and he didn’t know how many people remained unaccounted for.

The authorities located some suspected explosive devices, said James Deir, the special agent for the region from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, but it wasn’t clear if they were used to start the blaze. Expert fire investigators from the agency are coming to investigate the scene and determine the fire’s cause, he said.

In the aftermath of the shooting Sunday, police and firetrucks blocked off the road to the church at a busy intersection in Grand Blanc. A helicopter whirled above.

Across the highway, the authorities closed an IMAX movie theater so it could serve as a gathering place for people seeking information about their family members.

Ashley Duffie, a 33-year-old human-resources executive from Grand Blanc, stood in a nearby Buffalo Wild Wings parking lot to view what she could of the scene. Duffie said nothing like it had happened in Grand Blanc in her decade living there. She worries about an escalating cycle of violence.

“The country is very scary right now in general. Usually when stuff happens like this, then more people get crazy, and who knows what’s gonna happen,” she said.

Federal Bureau of Investigation official Reuben Coleman said the agency was leading the investigation and was committed to finding the motive behind the tragedy.

Law enforcement said it would investigate the suspect’s home and cellphone records.

After Sanford was killed, there were bomb threats made to churches and other locations, said Michigan State Police spokeswoman Kim Vetter. The authorities searched and cleared the locations, she said.

Politicians across the political spectrum condemned the shooting at the church.

President said in a social-media post that this “appeared to be yet another targeted attack on Christians” and called for an end to an epidemic of violence in the U.S.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints asked for cooperation with local authorities and thanked people for their concern and prayers. “Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection,” the church said.
