Oseguera, a former Mexican police officer, was the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which U.S. and Mexican authorities view as the country’s most powerful organized-crime group and the top cocaine smuggler to the U.S. The cartel also controls vast fuel smuggling schemes and other underworld rackets across Mexico and the U.S., authorities said.

Mexico’s Security Ministry said on Sunday that Oseguera was killed an operation led by Mexican special forces in the rural municipality of Tapalpa, some 80 miles southwest of the state capital of Guadalajara and close to Ajijic, a lakeshore community popular with a large American retiree community.

The ministry said in a statement that the country’s central military intelligence unit planned and executed the operation with Mexico’s armed forces, including Air Force aircraft and the National Guard’s Immediate Reaction Force.

Oseguera was known for sophisticated paramilitary tactics and the deployment of hundreds of well-equipped and well-trained gunmen. He controlled vast swaths of territory, especially in his home state of Jalisco. He has been expanding his influence and was locked in a bloody struggle for control of Michoacán state in Western Mexico.

The U.S. has a $15 million bounty on Oseguera. He rarely left his mountain compound, according to authorities. Few photos of him circulate. The cadre of men protecting Oseguera, known as the Special Force of the High Command, carry heat-seeking, shoulder-fired rocket launchers capable of piercing a tank, people familiar with cartel operations said.

The Security Ministry said Sunday that special forces were attacked during the raid. “They returned fire,” it said.

Four cartel members were killed at the scene and three others were seriously wounded. The latter three died during their air transport to Mexico City, including Oseguera, the ministry said.

Oseguera, who grew up poor selling avocados, became the top trafficker of cocaine globally, say U.S. and Mexican authorities. His cartel transports the addictive powder by the ton from Colombia to Ecuador and then north to Mexico’s Pacific Coast via speedboats and semisubmersibles.

Oseguera’s gunmen responded to his death by burning cars and trucks and blocking roads in Guadalajara, Mexico’s second-largest city, as the government deployed security forces across western Mexico.

Roadblocks were also reported in the Pacific resort of Puerto Vallarta and the Gulf state of Tamaulipas on the border with the U.S. There were also reports of road blockades in other states. Professional soccer matches were postponed in Jalisco amid a flare-up in violence, authorities said.

Celebrated as “El Señor Mencho” in narco-ballads, Oseguera was viewed as an altruistic patriarch by some poor Mexicans living in areas controlled by the cartel, which organizes town fiestas and hands out food, medicine and toys.

In 1994, Oseguera was convicted of dealing heroin and served nearly three years in a California prison. He was deported to Mexico, where he married the daughter of the boss of a Sinaloa-affiliated gang. By 2011, he was leading his own organization based in Jalisco state.

Oseguera had recently made an alliance with the “Chapitos” faction of the Sinaloa cartel, which is fighting a civil war with a rival gang known as the “Mayitos.”

The crime boss’s death is expected to have a big impact across Mexico and is likely to spark a violent war for control of his empire.

The Jalisco cartel is largely a family business. One of Oseguera’s brothers, Antonio, known as Tony Montana after the Al Pacino character in the movie “Scarface,” was in charge of acquiring heavy weapons, according to a recent report by the Mexican Attorney General’s Office. The brother was arrested in 2022, and was among 29 drug bosses Mexico expelled to the U.S. last February.

Oseguera’s son, who also served as a top leader in the cartel, was sentenced in Washington, D.C., last year to life in prison for drug trafficking.

Hundreds of gunmen trained by former Colombian special forces work for Oseguera, according to Mexican officials. He travels through his territory in a small convoy of armored vehicles with a team equipped to fight off aggressors until reinforcements arrive.

In 2020, more than two dozen Jalisco cartel gunmen fired more than 400 rounds at the armored car ferrying Omar García Harfuch, then Mexico City’s security chief, on the capital’s elegant Paseo de la Reforma. García Harfuch [was hit three times but survived](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-city-security-chief-wounded-in-assassination-attempt-11593192065?mod=article_inline). Two of his bodyguards and a woman headed to work were killed.

García Harfuch now serves as security minister for Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, who is overseeing an offensive against organized crime as the Trump administration demanded greater enforcement to curb drug trafficking and illegal migration. President Trump has threatened unilateral military action to fight Mexican gangs if the government failed to confront cartels.

The Sheinbaum administration has also intensified bilateral cooperation to dismantle criminal groups such as the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels, with U.S. law enforcement and security agencies providing information and valuable high-tech intelligence such as drone surveillance.

Mexico’s Security Ministry said Sunday it was carrying out coordinated operations throughout Jalisco state and its capital, Guadalajara. It said on X that it was dealing with roadblocks after gang gunmen torched cars and heavy vehicles. Videos seen on social media showed plumes of black smoke rising from avenues in Puerto Vallarta, a Jalisco cartel stronghold and a top tourist destination for Americans.

Oseguera’s power and control of the underworld rose after the U.S. pressured Mexico to crack down on the Sinaloa cartel, where Oseguera got his start in the trade. The Sinaloans pioneered the manufacturing and smuggling of fentanyl, an industry breakthrough that sent cartel revenue soaring and drove up the number of fatal overdoses in the U.S.

Capturing Oseguera was seen by U.S. and Mexican law enforcement as an extremely high-risk operation because of his military might and the risks of widespread violence.

Oseguera’s death poses an immediate challenge to Mexican authorities, said Mike Burgoyne, a former U.S. military attaché in Mexico City. The government already faces one bloody cartel civil war in Sinaloa, and now it could have an even larger one in Jalisco.

“The Mexican government will have to fill that vacuum or the organization will fracture, there will be infighting and more violence,” said Burgoyne, now a professor at the University of Arizona. With this strike, Mexico had provided a “scalp to the U.S., putting off the threat of unilateral U.S. military action against the cartels.”

MEXICO CITY—Mexico’s military killed the country’s most powerful drug kingpin, Nemesio “Mencho” Oseguera, stepping up the government’s war against cartels amid U.S. pressure to curb drug trafficking.
