The feminist movement, often characterized in terms of "waves," describes different periods of feminist activism and thought. These waves have distinct focuses, although there's some overlap and interplay between them. Here's an overview of the three primary waves of feminism:

1. **First Wave (Late 19th to Early 20th Century):**
    - **Focus:** This wave primarily centered on legal issues, especially women's suffrage (the right to vote). 
    - **Key Issues and Accomplishments:** Aside from suffrage, first-wave feminists also focused on property rights for women, women's education, and marriage laws. By the early 20th century, many countries, including the U.S. in 1920, granted women the right to vote.
    - **Notable Figures:** Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Emmeline Pankhurst, Sojourner Truth.

2. **Second Wave (1960s-1980s):**
    - **Focus:** This wave broadened the debate to a wider range of issues: sexuality, family, the workplace, reproductive rights, de facto inequalities, and official legal inequalities.
    - **Key Issues and Accomplishments:** Second-wave feminism tackled issues like the end of enforced gender roles, the sexual revolution, reproductive rights (including the right to abortion), and the passing of laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender, such as Title IX in the U.S.
    - **Notable Figures:** Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, Germaine Greer.

3. **Third Wave (1990s-2010s):**
    - **Focus:** The third wave arose in response to perceived failures of the second wave and to challenges posed by movements considered outside of second wave feminism, such as post-structuralism. It also addressed the perceived oversight of the second wave's focus mostly on white, middle-class women.
    - **Key Issues and Accomplishments:** This wave tackled issues of intersectionality (the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender), gender norms, body positivity, and sexuality. It also criticized what it perceived as the second wave's essentialist definitions of femininity.
    - **Notable Figures:** Rebecca Walker (who coined the term "third wave"), Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw (known for introducing intersectionality), Anita Hill.

It's worth noting that some scholars and activists argue that we are currently in a fourth wave of feminism, which started in the 2010s. This potential "fourth wave" is characterized by online activism and focuses on sexual harassment, body shaming, and rape culture, among other issues. It also heavily emphasizes intersectionality, recognizing the interconnected experiences of women of different races, classes, sexualities, and other identities.
