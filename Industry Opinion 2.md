### Off the Cuff on Gartner's 2014 BI Quadrant

Here at Cubegeek as well as at my other blogs I try to be as informal and devoid of bullshit as possible, and of course that includes the fact that I acknowledge the existence of bullshit in the necessity to say such an unpleasant word. But it's also possible that I, through the limited experiences of a generation or two in the software business do my share of promulgating opinions that are full of it. So be warned, here are some off the cuff remarks about the latest Gartner BI Quadrant informed by my couple dozen years in the business. [![Gartner-mq-2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20210926145817im_/https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201a51174ee03970c-320wi "Gartner-mq-2014")](https://web.archive.org/web/20210926145817/http://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201a51174ee03970c-popup)

First off on Gartner itself. These guys are reliable and as long as I've been around, this magic quadrant assessment has been accurate and useful. They are marketing folks that understand what corporate buyers are looking for and what they are actually buying. They can't tell you very well how well the products work when it comes to implementation, or eventual TCO from a developer's point of view, but they are drivers of the checkboxes that matter in enterprise sales. In terms of understanding the market, you can't go too wrong reading Gartner. That said, only a longitudinal look at Gartner's stuff will give you an industry wide emphasis on what matters in the long term. As I read this (and I haven't for a while) I see how accurate it is to notice that Scorecards have dropped off the map. It was always a huge deal that brought tons of expertise, lots of controversy and little to no revenue.

Anyway. Having been in post-sales as well as pre-sales consulting I get to understand marketing and development as well has how different organizations approach and deal with BI tech & products. Lucky me.  
  
Let's start at the low end. I don't know a lot of these vendors but I'll try to be blunt.  
  
Infor used to have great marketing and a captive audience. They were very sophisticated about a few things and you could never separate their customers from them. That is a kind of death spiral. I'm not surprised. I think they were very closed.  
  
Arcplan was a brilliant product 20 years ago. They innovated in visual programming back in the days of Powerbuilder. Their product was large, sophisticated, comprehensive and German - like a plane with a million switches in the cockpit, you could do anything. However most of the time you just wanted to do one or two things and it was very clumsy. Big learning curve, small payoff.  
  
Actuate was a very nice small limited capability product run buy one or two guys, if I remember correctly. It was a low price alternative doing 80/20 on 70% of what big clients needed. I don't think they have enough revenue to extend the product much.  
  
Pentaho and Jaspersoft I'm going to put in the same bucket. These are low / no-cost open source community products with pay enterprise editions. I like the technical vision of the guys at Pentaho and they are very well marketed. Prior to coming out with that set of tools, the developers there made a standout product which was my favorite in the Hyperion universe. Back in the day when fat clients ruled, they were absolute masters. I haven't seen their latest stuff, and so I'm a little surprised to see them ranked equally with Jaspersoft. Pentaho has done a very admirable job understanding the dynamics of DW building and because of that their ETL vision is pretty fine. I trust them to get data from end to end elegantly.  
  
Jaspersoft has made one of the nicest plug and play adhoc reporting front ends in the business with a zillion capabilities in the back end. They have some old heads in the BI field working with geeky java devs who, like a swarm of ants, have put everything into an Eclipse metaphor, and slowly added every little function possible with every open source widget. There's an upside and a downside to this. The internals of Jasper are unapproachable to any but java geeks and consequently the higher level UI design for application builders is unnecessarily complex. On the other hand, their approach to data in the domain concept, is very nice.

I haven't seen anything new from Panorama at all, so I hesitate to comment. They are deeply smart on database technology having made SQL Server into that thing that is MSAS. I would seriously consider whatever they do. I'm tempted to go to their website and eyeball their product offerings, but I would rather remain off the cuff.

Good Data should have been higher if their products were as good as their marketing. I think it's rather telling that they are not given the size of their company and market. So I suspect the product line is getting large and confusing without techical vision. Just a suspicion.  
  

Logi Analytics. Don't know them. Would check them out. Birst, same thing. IBI don't trust them. Never liked their technology. Same with Microstrategy. They built a product that was ridiculously complex and made their 20 somethings work 60 hour weeks to make it work - then depended on lock in and Moore's Law to save their bacon. They have too much money to be stupid, but elegance is something you can't buy and Microstrategy doesn't have it. Again. See how tightly this group is situated. There are no breakout products here. The companies on the large side cannot innovate much for fear of losing embedded customers - the companies on the small side cannot innovate much because that costs money.

Oracle does one thing better than anybody and that is provide every good support for a large range of very capable and diverse products. And whatever they can't build, they buy. However, survival of the fittest means no evolutionary leaps. They buy those competing products and let them sink or swim in an ever-expanding product line. Machiavellian, sure. It does work.  
  
Tibco. I don't understand them at all. Spotfire was supposed to be awesome, a simple capable product with a very sweet look and brain dead simple implementation. Methinks that mantle has been taken over by Qlikview, which makes it a market leader because they do 80/20 best. In fact, the only problem Qlikview has is that it operates on the same premise as Crystal Reports. It makes so many tasks so easy that it frustrates database experts by putting lots of development in the hands of non-developers. Three years ago they went big to a lot of people saying 'Its about time'. I suspect Qlik will be eating Tibco's lunch as time goes on, and those simpler products go the way of Actuate.

IBM, SAS, SAP  
These are you sure bets. When it comes to BI, they tend to be a bit more focused than Oracle. That's my perception. SAP owns what used to be Business Objects and Sybase. Great combination, good integration, excellent rebranding and as always, steamroller implementation. SAP owns its customers like nobody else. SAS on the other hand loves its customers like nobody else and wraps them in a blanket of competence that goes across every platform. It's a good safe place to be. IBM has acquired what used to be Cognos, and is broadminded and competent enough on so very many levels as to not be threatened by anything or anybody. What's new about this is that I have sensed that what they are now talking about with data governance and smarter planet is going to pay off big time in the vision department. Just don't let them do the implementation.

OK Microsoft. I honestly don't know what MSFT is doing these days that puts them so high up there. Obviously they have the resources to deliver. Obviously SQL Server is a workhorse that handles BI sized volumes of data capably. But it's just as obvious to me that as soon as they say something like Office integration or Sharepoint integration, I feel a hairball coming up. So I cheated and looked at PowerBI, and it looks like Windows 8 Sharepoint integration. I only peeked for 30 seconds mind you, and that's my sense of it. I have a strong bias against the Microsoft development environment that comes from years of frustration. There's no denying two things about Microsoft. One they put hundreds of millions of people into desktop computing. Two, they are not innovators when it comes to the web, in fact they suck pretty bad. So I have a fundamental difficulty with their core technologies and product philosophies, IE lack of Linux. So just really.. their interoperability path is frightening, and I really just can't get over that. All that said, somebody at Microsoft has been very busy.

Which brings us to the undisputed champions, Tableau. I saw this one coming, which is probably a serious reason why I decided to write this. Tableau as a company is full of shiny happy people and they have every reason to be so. They basically invented a visual language, and as an old Xerox head I like people who take visualization seriously. There are not a bunch of widgets slammed together using libraries anybody can find on the web, it's original stuff. Tableau has been marketed well, and they dominate the space occupied by marketing people - they've opened up doors for the kinds of databases I want to work with (columnar stores) and they're cloud friendly. But the bottom line is the capability of the tool, which is extraordinary and comprehensive. Everything about Tableau just screams 'good design'.  
  
Yes, I am about to get deep into Tableau this year, which is something I've kind of been saying more or less for several years. I don't see any reason why, as a BI front-end, Tableau can't rule for a long time, and this week I'll be setting up my own lab in AWS to start seeing what I can make that puppy do with Redshift. I suspect the answer will be a hell of a lot, depending on its cacheing strategy. So I'll be debunking my own hype as time goes by, and I'll probably identify its fundamental flaw rather quickly - which will be that it runs only on Windows. But in the 64 bit world, Windows can be quite capable as an application server, so long as the stack is not extraordinarily thick. So yeah I am admitting to a certain degree that horizontal scaling of Tableau data servers may not be troublesome even though it's Windows based. We'll see.

So there are my grains of salt to be reconciled with what Gartner actually says. There may be a lot of activity in the BI business world, but mastery of several certain principles is all it really takes. In the end, we are limited by human cognition and data quality, so these tools can only be so good. I put the premium on elegance of design, deployability and scalability. There's a lot in elegance of design that's very difficult to do, which is why certain new products can dominate this area quickly. So there's my gut, off the cuff. Best of luck with your decisions.

### Feedly for Me

IJWTS that as Google Reader dies its untimely death that I'm going with Feedly. I would have liked to have stayed with Flipboard but they just went too far with the winky blinkies and cluttered up my screen. They refused to support Evernote and so this is the end. So long, farewell and quite frankly good riddance. I can't figure out what the hell they were thinking when they decided to add that ridiculous floating sidebar, but that will no longer be my problem. Goodbye Flipboard, hello again Feedly.

Because it's information you have just got to know.

### Obligatory Seriousness on Apple Maps

I made a very stupid mistake yesterday. I forgot to pack my MacBook's power cable for my 2 day trip to San Francisco. Always in the back of my head, I know that I can pickup socks or even a pair of slacks if I mispack. I realized once I got off the plane that I would need to make a trip to the Apple Store. So I had to find my way there. This was going to be my first test of the new Apple Maps, which was to get me via public transit (BART) from SFO to Market Street. Either way it was going to be cheaper than taking a limo, BART cost $8.50 the limo costs $30 plus tip.

The signs at the airport are pretty good. Good enough for me to follow arrows to the Airtrain. The Airtrain (free) went to the [BART station](https://web.archive.org/web/20210926145817/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit "Bay Area Rapid Transit"). I put ten bucks on the card and 30 minutes later, I was at the Powell Street Station, two blocks away from my final destination.

The problem with Apple Maps is that it doesn't have any information about the BART. However, as soon as you ask for that local information, Apple Maps shows you the door to the Apple Store and a selection of local transportation routing apps. So I had to wait 30 whole seconds to choose and download Embark iBART which cost me, uhm.. free. I've actually done this routine before, with [Google Maps](https://web.archive.org/web/20210926145817/http://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2012/08/apple-crushes-samsung.html "Apple Crushes Samsung") which didn't have bus schedules for Washington DC. I got that app (I think I paid a couple bucks for it) and was satisfied.

My problem was now looking up the price of the new power cable. $79 bucks at the Apple Store. Are you kidding me? So now I use Apple Maps to find a used dealer around here where I can get a second hand cable and save some money. Mission accomplished with Apple Maps. I found Keane over in the Flood Building. I saved money by getting a used one, not as much as I would have liked. I left that building feeling really pissed off at myself for leaving my power cable at home. That mistake cost me more than 65 bucks. Getting a free Apple Maps, saved me $21.50 each way, given the comfort I now have taking BART.

But that's just money. What about technical features? I have a hard time not being a Boy Scout snob about this whole thing. If the difference between Apple Maps and Google Maps leaves you lost and stranded, I would say that the defects in your sense of direction are likely to cost you orders of magnitude more money than the difference you will pay between the two apps. In other words, if Apple Maps isn't good enough for you, then you're more than simply lost, you are simply clueless.

Does that make me a fanboy? Sure, if it makes you happy to call me that, go ahead. But if you can't get around without turn by turn instructions, what does that make you?

### The Beginning of the End of an Era

If you've heard me blather about my technical accomplishments for any length of time, then you'll hear me brag about the Boeing CPS project. It was by a good measure the most ambitious project I have ever been involved in. The short end of the story was that I showed how I could get 500 databases to run concurrently in memory. I performed that minor miracle with the help of a a guy who knew LoadRunner inside and out and a team of techs at HP. You see this was done on a massive HP Superdome machine. I did this about four years ago at HP's Cupertino campus.

It turns out that HP has just sold off the property where such levels of supercomputing research, testing and debugging was done. This thus marks the end of an era, because the dudes I worked with up there had a bit of the shakes at the time. So if you ever heard me snark about Mark Hurd, it had something to do with the vibe they had knowing at the time that things were not going as well as they should have been. I was very impressed by the staff for the three weeks that I was up there, but I could see that we were sorta alone. I mean here was some of the coolest big iron available, when the enterprise IT world was still freshly adapting 64bit computing - the one thing that restored my flagging faith in Windows. I could work with 32 processors and 64GB of Ram. How sweet was that?

Well now that we know some of Google's four year old magic, it's not very sweet. And if that campus was the last place HP engaged massive computing with companies like Boeing for doing stuff that required that level of compute power, then [this sale to Apple](https://web.archive.org/web/20210926145817/https://www.9to5mac.com/37842/apple-buys-hps-cupertino-campus-for-around-300m?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher) represents another piece of inevitability for cloud computing.

### iAds: Exactly Wrong

I'm sure there are marketing folks who can't wait, but I get a queasy feeling watching this cringeworthy video that this Christmas season is the beginning of the end of a certain romance geeks have with Apple.

We all know the popular darling Apple has become - the consumer behemoth that it might become, with all sorts of clever encroachments on computing.. I don't know. Think about it. Ten years from now, when the majority of enterprise IT will be done in the Linux based cloudscapes, where will Apple have gone? Gone to market, every one. When will they ever learn?   

### The DevOps Manifesto

Is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210926145817/http://www.jedi.be/blog/2010/02/12/what-is-this-devops-thing-anyway/). I like especially the following part...

> On most projects I’ve worked on, the project team is split into developers, testers, release managers and sysadmins working in separate silos. From a process perspective this is dreadfully wasteful. It can also lead to a 'lob it over the wall' philosophy - problems are passed between business analysts, developers, QA specialists and sysadmins. Furthermore, we see a replication of this silo structure within the teams - it’s not uncommon to see dedicated database and network people in the same system team, alongside sysadmins. Often the larger silos aren't in the same office, the same city, or in sometimes not even in the same country. The result is an ‘us and them’ mentality - groups of people who are simultaneously suspicious of and afraid of each other.
> 
> The Devops movement is bold enough to believe that there’s a better way - a way of building teams, and building software that can solve these problems.
> 
> ## How does Devops help?
> 
> The Devops movement is built around a group of people who believe that the application of a combination of appropriate technology and attitude can revolutionize the world of software development and delivery.
> 
> The demographic seems to be experienced, talented 30-something sysadmin coders with a clear understanding that writing software is about making money and shipping product. More importantly, these people understand the key point - we’re all on the same side! All of us - developers, testers, managers, DBAs, network technicians, and sysadmins - are all trying to achieve the same thing: the delivery of great quality, reliable software that delivers business benefit to those who commissioned it.
> 
> Breaking this down a bit - one of the key statements there is ‘sysadmin coders’. There’s been a certain amount of popularity recently around the concept of ‘polyglot programmers’. These are developers who know multiple languages, and multiple approaches to programming, such that when appropriate they can move swiftly between object-oriented Ruby and a functional language such as Erlang or OCaml. This is simply an example of a larger observation - there is no one IT skill that is more useful or more powerful than another. To solve problems well you need all the skills. When you build teams around people who can be developers, testers, and sysadmins, you build remarkable teams.

I'll be at the Meetup tonight in Santa Monica. Maybe I'll recognize a face or two from Shopzilla.

### Computing Interfaces, Human Scale & The Death of Interoperability

Right about now I'm asking myself why it is that IBM doesn't own a phone company. It used to. It was Rolm. Tipped off by [Enderle](https://web.archive.org/web/20210926145817/http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/blogs/enderle/hp-and-palm-the-explosion-that-will-rock-the-computer-industry/?cs=40968), I am thinking about what moves and what doesn't move in the computer industry.

What's moving now is the peripherals market, and the hottest peripherals are now owned by Apple. They are enabled by the network market and the hottest networks are still boring, but the changing of new and old protocols are making it interesting. Matters of net neutrality, Flash vs Ogg vs H.264 and the adoption of cloud strategies are what's making it interesting. Database technology is undergoing a renaissance too.

Only Google seemed to have its head in the game of comprehensively coming up with a 'new' computing paradigm which is network centric and going after the desktop. That was until the introduction of Apple's iPad. Apple now has an opportunity and is showing evidence of the vision to disintermediate Microsoft's desktop domination.

Think about it this way. The desktop has been, for a generation, the dominant computing metaphor. It is how must computing work is done today and it is the desktop metaphor including the mouse and keyboard that is how must of us do what we call 'computing'. 30 years ago it was the green screen. 10 years before that it was the punched card. What are you touching when you are using a computer? That is the question. Those who define and dominate win, and it starts with the generation of data and ends with the consumption of data. That, broadly speaking is what the computer industry is all about, it is about interface domination. What goes on in the black box is only of concern to the industry professionals - the battles in the marketplace are won and lost on interface.

For example. What is gaming? Gaming is an interface market with competition between the iPhone + iPad, XBox360, PS3, DS, Wii, and the Desktop. The game console wars are pretty much over and the winner is Microsoft. They dominate and so now everyone must write to XBox. However Microsoft has opened up a new front with Project Natal. Interface.

All this has to do with HP + Palm because HP has perhaps determined that it needs to be its own software integrator. HP can now extend its compute capacity into a new interface. This is key.

As the number of interfaces goes up, the influence of architects of APIs increases as well. What Apple is doing to squish out competition on it's platform begins to defy the mantras of interoperability. Apple can afford to do so because what I call 'development economies of scale' make it such that organic developers are not really competitive. Once a small group of in-house programmers have access to resources that allow them to develop technologies at a sufficient sophistication, a labor market for programming becomes surplus, and then barriers to entry build. Who actually needs to build a better spoon? You cannot get many jobs in spoon design. It's not because there is no spoon, but because the spoon has already been perfected.  

Interoperability was important when teams of developers were still working on technologies that had not been completed to human scale. What do I mean by that? A technology that is complete to human scale means that you have a technology whose marginal improvement cannot be perceived by most humans. It's not about distinguishing them from magic, it's about distinguishing them at all. For example, it has long been the case in the audio electronics industry that the capability of the technology to record, transmit and reproduce sound has gone beyond the capabilities of human perception. Any good salesman at the stereo store will tell you that only 1 out of 50 people can actually hear the difference between a good $500 speaker and a good $5000 speaker. Why pay for the difference if you can't hear the difference? The clever stereo salesman would steer the prospective customer into believing he could hear the difference, but most of the time the customers could not - especially if they liked Cindy Lauper.

So how do people choose speakers today? Fashion, style, interface. The technology is complete to human scale - as such there is no need in the mainstream, to innovate. That's why 30 years ago, stereo components were the hot item, whereas today video components are hot. People can certainly perceive the difference between black and white and color. And now we are seeing the difference between low and high definition define the market. When everybody has HDTV, we'll all just buy for fashion, style, interface. The technology is done. It doesn't need to move.  

While the technology is still developing to human scale, small innovators can make a difference. Market makers will corral them and interoperability will matter. Once there is no more need for integration, the industry won't care about interoperability just like the TV industry no longer needs pin socket standards for the tubes in their audio amplifiers. Single companies can integrate the technology from end to end, streamline, lower costs and improve quality - but sell interface.

HP, with its acquisition of Palm now has an interface for mobility. It can now build phones. Does anybody care about the developers of Palm apps? No. They will now be HP apps and the API can be streamlined to fit HP's needs for mobility.

So what technologies are done and not moving in the computing industry because they have now reached human scale - the limits of human perception? Well, that's an interesting question that I'll start to think about. And while I do so, I'll keep an eye towards what happens when another interface solves another problem moving that problem towards human scale. This is how I can identify shifts in markets and opportunities for different vendors to leapfrog.

For example. I think a class of applications will emerge in the multitouch paradigm that will approach human scale that have never reached it in the desktop metaphor. I think that multitouch gestures can become a vocabulary for expression that will allow a much greater throughput than could be expected from keyboard & mouse. Guitar Hero showed a way to game that closer approximates the human scale of musicianship. There could never be a better way to play guitar via keyboard. You need to approach a guitar. Furthermore, as I've indicated previously, I think that sorting, distributing and shuffling will be better accomplished through multitouch interfaces than with mouse & keyboard interfaces.

  

### Flash & Cold Fusion

My two cents.

Flash on Apple? No. What difference does it make? It's the difference between legacy applications and new stuff, which is to say if the trend continues that Android will suck up all of the Flash world and Apple rejects it, Apple will be in the better long term position.

I seem to recall that Flash was the stuff of Web 1.0, back when it used to belong to a company called Macromedia and the greatest authoring tool in the world was Dreamweaver and HomeSite. Are you kidding me? And back when Adobe purchased Macromedia, what I recall was that the whole edifice was crumbling under its own weight. Adobe was the ship almost too late to save a drowning witch. Considering the number of other video standards that are out there, the big deal with Flash just doesn't seem to be a big deal to me. The best developers will easily adapt to new tools.

Just because you can name a product Cold Fusion doesn't mean you can defy the laws of thermodynamics.

### The Journalism Problem

Last night I listened to the NPR reporter interview the director from the service organization that just got dropped after a foster child was murdered here in LA. They guy took his time and explained patiently how his organization, which had been consistently rated in the top 10% of such providers to the government offices whose business is foster children and adoption got puked on for no good reasons.

It struck me that this was a no-win situation, especially as he mentioned that there is an ongoing investigation. An ongoing investigation means that somebody knows, its just that a bigger somebody with authority doesn't know yet and so officially nothing can be said. But that's somebody still knows. The problem is getting to that somebody is what makes for sensationalism. It is journalism and communications in a nutshell.

The NPR journalist took calls after the director of the service organization finished his statements. A woman from Orange County wanted to know the demographics of foster children and how it was that a family that keeps pit bulls can be approved as foster parents and potential adoptive parents. She wants blood. The LATimes journalist breaking the story is up next. I got out of my car and turned of the radio in disgust.

What's going on here is that the radio station and the newspaper, as part of their business model, need to highlight what's potentially wrong, which is by definition sensational. There's nothing wrong with that, it's important. What's wrong is that the newspaper cannot own that audience because the real audience for this story is longitudinal. The kind of outrage and blood the caller expressed is like an online flamewar with a newb. She obviously knows nothing about the subcontracting details and the authority delegated between the full-time bureacrats in the child welfare department, the care-giving subcontractors and the board of supervisors. None of us do. All we know is a two year old kid was murdered and the system didn't protect her.

The director mentioned the scorecarding system that the County uses to rate its subcontractors as well as the three government officials who would have to be involved in the approval of transfer from foster parentage to adoptive parentage. What we don't know is how well the system works so much of the time that we pay no attention to it. And if we are genuinely interested, where would we look? Most importantly how could we use a different form of communication to translate the energy of outrage which is currently owned by the radio station and the print media journalists into the energy of responsibility owned by the director's care-giving organization?

You see? The length of the attention span of the media in its current instantiation does a disservice to every organization that gets scandalized because the energy of the anti-scandal owned by the media outweighs the energy of reform.

Part of this imbalance is inevitable and cannot be fixed. Consumers cannot be producers. Anybody can enjoy listening to music, but only a few can play it, and only fewer still can compose it. We have a faux system of journalism that promises to enable democracy in conflict with this fundamental human fact. Everybody can be outraged at the death of a two year old, but only a very few of us can prevent it. The Director did not, and maybe he could not. However consumers can become prosumers if they are informed in the right ways. And so voters can become reformers if they are given the proper background. But this is not a job for journalism as it is currently constructed - it is more a job for the communications directors of such agency's as the one now under fire.

If this story generated 50,000 hits at the LATimes, how long with those same eyeballs stay glued? How long can the investigating journalist on the story write about it and follow up? How can those eyeballs be moved to a longer attention span with a prosumer / reformer / watchdog capacity that is credible even in the eyes of the Board of Supervisors, the child welfare agency and the subcontractors kiretsu? This is the problem to be solved in all of journalism and in all of communications. Journalism has to itself move from pique to education or the burden needs to be gracefully transitioned to the communications abilities of the first parties. When the care-giver's agency can take those 50,000 hits and disseminate on a long term basis, then we have a win.

Until then it will be outrage as usual and frustration with the system. This is what the current media generates.
