A list of 30 employees and alleged allies of [Elon Musk](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/elon-musk) 's newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been published by ProPublica, an investigative news outlet.

*Newsweek* reached out to Musk for comment via emails to the [Tesla](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/tesla) and [SpaceX](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/spacex) press offices.

DOGE, a U.S. government organization which, despite its name, doesn't have full department status, was [created by President Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/doge-becomes-official-what-know-2019145) via an executive order on January 20 with the aim of cutting what the new administration regards as wasteful spending. Musk, a close Trump ally, heads the body and has been given special government employee status.

Musk has called for sweeping cuts to federal spending, suggesting it could be reduced by [up to $2 trillion per year](https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-backtracks-doge-federal-budget-cut-2012419) out of a [2024 total of $6.75 trillion](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/), according to U.S. Treasury figures.

This ties in with Trump's pledge to "drain the swamp," a term his supporters use for what they believe is a permanent left-leaning bureaucracy that holds massive power regardless of who is in the White House.

DOGE has already recommended that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) [be closed down](https://www.newsweek.com/doge-elon-musk-cuts-list-donald-trump-meaning-2027436), with its functions transferred to the State Department. In a [recent interview](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-unleash-musk-doge-military-expects-find-fraud-abuse-2028497), Trump said he wants DOGE to go through spending at the Departments of Education and Defense.

On February 8, a federal judge [imposed a temporary restraining order](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-doge-treasury-elon-musk-federal-judge-access-engelmayer-2028693) blocking DOGE employees from accessing the Treasury Department's payment system, resulting in Musk calling for him to be impeached.

A White House spokesperson told ProPublica: "Those leading this mission with Elon Musk are doing so in full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities."
