Imagine that you love and respect your mother and father and aunts and uncles. They have done everything to help you become the person you are, primarily because there was nothing they didn’t provide for you. You are family. You have family rules, which disobeyed result in punishment. Moreover, you are rich family. You have special family rules, which disobeyed result in particular punishment meaning, a lot less money for you.

So what do you know.? You know that your father and his brother were actually geniuses that built a business from scratch and you know that there is no way in hell you will ever be as smart and successful as they are. You’re just average. You are average, but also rich. And you have the experience of screwing up so bad that you literally cost your family a million dollars. How? You just wrecked a car. Anybody could wreck a car, but it was a very expensive car at a very expensive party and you wrecked into somebody else’s very expensive car. Then your parents had to pay a very expensive attorney to keep your drunk ass out of jail and probation. Anybody can make this kind of mistake, jeez. Yeah but you’re from a rich family.

Now you have that hanging over your head. At the age of 30 you have tried several different jobs, but nobody really takes you seriously. You’re just mediocre. Why would you be unhappy? Because everybody you tell that you’ve got money tells you “Yo but dude you’re so rich…you could buy… blah blab blah.” The more of your parents money you take, the more you owe them, the less independent you are. You’ll never be happy as just an ordinary Joe. So you change your name so nobody knows you are from that famous family. But everyone you date and hang around wants to know more about you and your past. And they think you’re always hiding something about your past, and yeah you are.

You’ve been to yoga. You’ve done keto diets. You moved to the South of France. You tried skiing. But you can’t escape. It’s you. You tried religion. You tried drugs. You tried slumming it. You tried everything you can think of, but it all seems pointless. Plus half the people you hang around absolutely hate rich people. If they ever found out about your family, they’d probably try to take you hostage for ransom. So you have to pretend that you’re poor and have a shitty life, but you actually do have a shitty life. And every happy person you meet who’s not rich reminds you of how shitty a life you have. And of course you go to therapy that is completely paid for. What’s the use. You can’t even talk about suicide or drugs (again) because then they’d lock you up. Then you’d have to start all over.

But here’s the thing. You have absolutely one thing going for you. Whenever you fuck up, which is kind of often, the only person who suffers is you. Not like your uncle and your dad. Like everybody on Wall Street knows every mistake they make, like that layoff they had to do 3 years ago when all those people lost their jobs and threw bricks at Mom’s car. And everybody who is a Democrat just hates them whenever they hear the family name, like they’re Nazis or something. I don’t know how they put up with it, all that stress. Then of course how would you know, you’re not on the business side of the family. You’re on the oddball loser douchebag fuckboi side of the family. But, like whatever.

You can always go hang out in Prague or Vail or Miami or Lake Como, you know, depending on what season it is with the other douchebag friends. I mean, at least they understand. Like me and Jaden and get along real cool. Even then, though. Like we’re at a club and somebody recognizes one of us, then you know the drill…ahh. Why am I even talking to you?
