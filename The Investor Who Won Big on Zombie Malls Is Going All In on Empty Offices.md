## New York-based Namdar and partners have acquired 10 buildings for more than $480 million since 2021

An investor known for squeezing cash out of [dying malls](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial/malls-real-estate-shopping-24c3d7fd?mod=article_inline) is now trying a similar approach to profit from tanking office towers.  

Namdar Realty Group started buying office buildings in major markets after the pandemic hit and office values plummeted. The Great Neck, N.Y.-based company and its partners have acquired 10 office buildings for more than $480 million since 2021 in prime locations across Chicago, Cleveland and New York City.
