It never sold in huge numbers, but its reach was world changing. It was gamble that a company could be built on a vehicle powered by what was commonly dismissed by rivals at the time as essentially laptop batteries.

The Model S’s improbable success in 2012, a proof point that Musk could, in fact, not only make cars but do so at a profit, paved the way for then-Tesla Motors to become what it is today: the world’s most valuable automaker.

Along the way, Musk’s idea of what a car could be upended the global automotive industry and helped fuel a boom in green-energy investments that aimed to emulate what Musk achieved.

Now, the sedan’s demise epitomizes the dramatic change occurring—yet again—at Tesla as Musk takes on his next big gamble: [reshaping the carmaker](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-tesla-strategy-ai-driverless-car-97721be5?mod=article_inline) into a robotics company.

The San Francisco Bay-area factory space used for making the Model S and its SUV sibling, the Model X, will be retooled to build [humanoid robots](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-optimus-robots-7196d53e?mod=article_inline), perhaps as many as one million a year. Production winds down next quarter, the company said Wednesday.

Killing off the Model S is another [burn-the-boats](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-net-worth-trillionaire-2026-c4300aa3?mod=article_inline) kind of moment for Musk as he approaches a new land of robotics. By narrowing the company’s [moneymaking lineup](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/the-withering-dream-of-a-cheap-american-electric-car-ad7e1113?mod=article_inline), he is giving himself even less room for error. But he says his bets on a yet-unproven technology—robocars and roboworkers—will make Tesla even more valuable than it was selling cars to human drivers.

It is the kind of gamble Musk has been making at Tesla since the early days. Not satisfied with the success of the Model S, for example, he [doubled down](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-races-to-exit-teslas-production-hell-1530149814?mod=article_inline) on a belief that a cheaper version of that car could appeal to more people and usher in an electric age of the automobile.

The Model S was born out of Tesla’s first offering, the Roadster. That was less a finely tuned automobile and more a Frankenstein’s monster built off a Lotus Elise and powered by the startup’s electric powertrain.

But it served the purpose as an early proof of concept that an electric car could be made sexy. The Model S was going to show that Tesla could design and build its own cars.

A seemingly simple strategy, but success wasn’t a given, especially in 2008 as Musk struggled to keep the lights on. Getting the Roadster out nearly sank Tesla. And efforts to develop its next car, code named “WhiteStar,” were troubled.

Early designs were so ugly—with an unflattering roof line that gave the vehicle a bulbous appearance—that some frustrated employees began calling the vehicle the “white whale.”

It seemed Musk would need a Captain Ahab fixation to make the Model S real.

In those dark days, JB Straubel, one of the brains behind Tesla’s battery technology, found renewed faith in what Tesla could be after quietly retrofitting a Mercedes sedan with his electric powertrain. While the Roadster rode rough, the Straubel mule, with Mercedes’s finely tuned suspension and Tesla’s all but silent battery-powered motor, flew like a magic carpet ride.

For my book on Tesla’s history, “Power Play,” Straubel told me: “It felt like it was going to change the world if we could have people experience this—if we could actually productize it and make it work.”

Doing that required dramatic change. Around early 2009, Musk threw out the WhiteStar work and hired new, key players, such as U.K. car engineer Peter Rawlinson, to join him and Straubel on a project many in the industry thought foolish.

“Nobody took it seriously…we couldn’t even get suppliers to supply us parts,” Rawlinson, who became chief engineer, told me Thursday.

With the Model S, Musk wanted to make the world’s best car that just happened to be electric. In that, Rawlinson said he saw a rare chance to rethink how cars were created, eschewing traditional processes that he saw as simply iterative of what had come before.

To make the Model S real, Tesla needed a car factory, an army of workers and—more important—time to get the vehicle into production. What it *needed* was cash. Lots of it.

The design for the car, revealed publicly in early 2009, would be Musk’s most potent weapon in selling investors on the company and getting Tesla that money. Early versions of the Model S sold the vision. The instantaneous send-off that electric cars have made it an amusement park at every stop light.

By the time the car was ready for production in 2012, the first versions weren’t $50,000 offerings as Musk had originally touted. It was more like $100,000.

That wouldn’t matter. The *idea* of the car would win the day. The Model S received rave reviews. An early customer, Jeff Skoll, the eBay billionaire, would rank the Model S up there with the PC and iPhone “as the greatest consumer tech products ever created.”

Overcoming what felt like constant production problems and growing pains, the company sold enough of the cars in the first quarter of 2013 to eke out [a slim profit](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323744604578471662132369972?mod=article_inline). That fueled Wall Street enthusiasm, allowing Musk to raise more money and plot the third step in his vision for Tesla. This was the more affordable sedan, the Model 3, and subsequently the Model Y SUV.

The Model S’s success caught traditional automakers off guard. Bob Lutz, the legendary Motor City car executive, said the industry mistakenly assumed EVs should be small and appeal to low-income buyers looking to save on fuel costs. “Musk realized that the right strategy with a new technology was to create a beautiful, expensive car that would appeal to affluent early-adopters,” said Lutz, whose career included championing the Chevrolet Volt, General Motors’ failed effort to leapfrog Tesla’s rise.

For years, the Model S and Model X were the bedrock of Tesla’s business, allowing it to develop its next generation of vehicles. Deliveries of the Model S and Model X peaked at more than 100,000 units in 2017, the year the Model 3 began production. Sales of the Model S, long overdue a proper upgrade, finished last year at a fraction of that.

With the end of the Model S in sight, that reality set in this week for some of Tesla’s biggest car fans. Musk, who has been talking about autonomous cars and robots for years, really is serious about that future. He’s pivoting again.

“The more I think about the S/X being cancelled…the more sad I get,” Matt Linn, a vocal Tesla fan, [posted](https://x.com/Mattlinn01/status/2016646674811363714?s=20) on social media. “It’s now clearer than ever. Tesla has no interest in making cars anymore.”

It was a salute to a special era.

With a low-slung look reminiscent of an Aston Martin, acceleration rivaling a Bugatti and a high-tech interior more at home in an Apple store than a traditional car dealership, the all-electric sedan [was unlike anything](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304211804577504632238740966?mod=article_inline) the automotive industry had seen.
