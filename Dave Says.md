Both the reviewer and the author here are firmly on the political left—people who still think in terms of class, material conditions, and the universalist aspirations of old-school liberal and socialist traditions, not the newer focus on "immutable characteristics" as the basis of political identity. Their critique of wokeness doesn’t come from the right; it comes from a left that sees today’s identitarian politics as philosophically incoherent, historically regressive, and ultimately corrosive of solidarities that once centered the poor and the working class.

Below is an excerpt from the New York Review of Books review:

q/Wokeness is hard to define because it’s an incoherent concept, built on a contradiction between feeling and thought. It’s fueled by emotions traditionally held by the left. When in doubt, stand by those on the margins: the tired, the poor, the hungry, those yearning to breathe free. Those emotions, however, are undermined by beliefs that have traditionally belonged to the right. What are called identity politics—misleadingly, since they reduce our rich and various identities to our ethnic and gender origins—assume that you will have real connections and deep obligations only to those who belong to your own tribe, though others may be useful as allies. Calls for justice are sometimes viewed as liberal attempts to impose (Eurocentric) values on others; anyone who claims to be acting for the sake of a universal humanity is deceptive. Finally, apparent steps toward progress are simply subtler forms of oppression. Add to all of this the suspicion that reason is a form of domination that replaced more honest struggles for power, and you have a worldview that is not far from one held by the worst reactionaries. I am not arguing, as is commonly suggested, that wokeness was on the right track but went too far. Rather, by unwittingly accepting deeply regressive philosophical assumptions, it went in the wrong direction entirely. \[...\]

In the final pages of Desire and Fate Rieff homes in on his main target: the cultural impulse that drives woke extremes. Building on his father Philip Rieff’s The Triumph of the Therapeutic (1966), he contends that we have reached “the triumph of the traumatic.” Indeed, at one point he calls it the “dictatorship of the therapeutic.” It’s a shame that, though he references Giorgio Agamben’s State of Exception (2003) three times, he doesn’t discuss the writer to whom Agamben’s book is devoted: the Nazi legal theorist Carl Schmitt. The ways in which central themes of the woke can be found in Schmitt’s work—the nonchalant commitment to tribalism, the conviction that appeals to humanity are fraudulent liberal stratagems, the longing for a premodern age—would have provided plenty of fodder for Rieff’s critique.

The new normal, he says, is utter fragility: “Ours is an age in which people routinely, even ritualistically, speak of feeling unsafe when in fact what they are is offended…. This is why Woke is, at its core, an expression of moral and social hypochondria.” Rieff hints at but doesn’t explicate the connection between this observation and his claim that “we now live in a culture in which not to consider yourself a victim is a pathology…or else, whether you realize it or not, or are willing to admit it or not, it is to be an oppressor.” Rieff exaggerates only slightly. What’s true is that victimhood now receives the sort of social recognition that used to be reserved for heroism. And since it’s easier to become a victim than a hero, there’s good reason, in the present economy of psychic attention, to keep your wounds open.

It’s startling to learn from Rieff that it has only been a decade since the DSM-V changed its definition of post-traumatic stress disorder, for it feels more settled than that. Whereas earlier diagnoses required a patient’s exposure to “high magnitude catastrophic events” like wars or earthquakes or torture, now trauma is a name for most any form of adversity that all but the most fortunate undergo at some point in our lives, “such as learning that a family member had died, or witnessing a fight.” This is, among other things, a banalization of the traumas experienced by those, say, forced to watch the murder of their parents or children, or any other form of evil that actually deserves the name. Rieff also calls it a depoliticization of hardship: “Though the reckoning includes demands for economic justice, almost all the energies of the identitarian left are mobilized in the service of psychic justice.”/q
