This is a pretty good thread. Likely true!  
  
Consider, however, reading it from a different angle.  
  
Stipulate for the moment that the power of mathematics and physics was so decisively proven at Los Alamos that it is obvious that The United States needs to run a secure \*permanent\* well funded Manhattan project, but that it cannot do so in the open, nor at a hidden location like New Mexico. In such situations what is standard operating procedure? You typically set up a ‚ÄúFront Company‚Äù. But this would be a Front University. And that doesn‚Äôt exist.  
  
So what do we see: a secure campus with billions coursing through it. The returns are cartoonish: a story but with no real explanation. The fund discourages all outside investors with sky high commitments (notice the similarity to Epstein?) and is then outright closed to outside money. It employs exactly the right specialties for military work, and interacts closely with a national lab: Brookhaven. It also interacts with one of the greatest math departments anywhere SUNYSB that is consistantly and inexplicably officially ranked well \*below\* the level of its faculty. The fund strategy never leaks. The co-founder comes out of Defense Intelligence.  
  
If I were a modern day Gen. Leslie Groves tasked with building Los Alamos 2.0 all over again, I would invent EXACTLY this. And I would look for Jim to lead it. He would have been one of the top 3 picks. If I were to do it today I might chose Daniel S. Freed.  
  
I knew Jim. He was \*absolutely\* brilliant. But not obviously more or less so than his colleagues at the very top of mathematics. Like Oppenheimer level impressive among Feynmans, Fermis, VonNeumanns, Tellers etc. You get used to the idea that Genius tends to collect in Math, Chess, Physics and Music.  
  
Everyone at this level is beyond impressive. And no one else has these returns.  
  
Try reading this thread with both explanations in mind. I myself don‚Äôt know the answer. What do you think? Does the usual story work for you? Is the alternative just too crazy even to contemplate? What would you have said if I told you something didn‚Äôt add up with a lot of brilliant theotists at an Old School out in the middle of nowhere in New Mexico in 1944?  
  
Let me know your thoughts. Thx!

Your Economics department took orders from 2 senators (Packwood (R) & Moynihan (D)) as an extension of the USG to bury my research w/ P Malaney so that it could fake a 1.1% CPI overstatement to raise Taxes (via indexed brackets) and cut SS payments (via COLAs)!  
  
You are lying.

Let me explain the previous slide of Boskin Commissioner Prof. Robert Gordon in plain English.  
  
Harvard‚Äôs Samuel W. Morris Professor Dale Jorgenson told the Boskin Commission (created by the senators) that to shave an even one TRiLLION dollars ($1,000,000,000,000) off of social security payments they would merely need to justify an oddly specific 1.1% overstatement in the consumer price index.  
  
Which they did. ‚ÄúSomehow‚Äù.  
  
‚ÄúSomehow‚Äù involved destroying anyone who said ‚ÄúCPI doesn‚Äôt work like that at all! It‚Äôs not a number you can dial to get consequences you like.‚Äù  
  
@Harvard: if you want to have me back, I will debate anyone in your economics department as a former member myself that Harvard Economics frequently has acted as an arm of the USG to bury research or dissenting experts that contradicted the narratives set in DC.  
  
We can discuss trade as well as immigration.  
  
If you were standing for academic independence, I would be shoulder to shoulder with you. But you are disguising the actual relationship between Harvard and the Federal Government where Harvard often academically launders government narratives to push policy objectives down the throats of ordinary Americans as favors to power and DC.

So how do the big boys play?  
  
First: Peer review before publication is for the little people:

Learning a lot. Or maybe I am just getting confused. I will take this down if it is all wrong. There just isn't a lot of guidance as to what I am looking at.  
  
Q: Am I to understand that King Abdullah of Jordan had/has a Jewish Brother because the CIA procured a Jewish Starlet for King Hussein? That can't be right.  
  
Or that the CIA will build an entire set in the United States from a photograph of a room taken in Moscow, hire Actors and 'Actresses' that resemble both foreign leaders and their female associates, and shoot naughty short films in Los Angeles to look like a tryst took place in a room in Russia?  

And when the individual says: "That is not true!" they sound like an insane person. Why?  
  
Because of the epithet 'Conspiracy Theorist'! This is so brilliant.  
  
This was called "image cheapening" in the trade.  
  
Here the CIA is acting as a film company, financing risque short films to appear as as-if "fake documentaries", to remove leaders by cheapening their images.

Q: How do you know someone does not know mathematics?  
  
A: They are focused on beating China/India in math rather than France.  
  
Q: How do you know if they don‚Äôt understand labor markets?  
  
A: They claim we need ‚ÄúThe best and the brightest!‚Äù when it‚Äôs actually a \*value\* competition.

We are having a discussion about mathematics led by business people who don‚Äôt actually themselves believe in mathematical expertise or labor market analysis or even free markets.  
  
I don‚Äôt know what they think mathematics is. It‚Äôs very expensive to hire The Best & The Brightest.

Looking to China/India in math is the \*same\* problem as looking up to Super Models and Boxers as role models.  
  
I don‚Äôt think this is about mathematics.  
  
I think this is about value for employers.  
  
And I want it debated.  
  
Mathematics remains dominated by Europe and North America:

People want my speculation on 'drones' over the East Coast.  
  
Let's take note of the following: I am not hearing ANYONE say "Let's get smart people together with resources."  
  
At this point I don't take \*anyone\* seriously in USG who doesn't ask to convene smart people & resources.

This is simple.  
  
A) You call up smart people & tell them it's urgent.  
B) You tell them where you want them to go.  
C) You send transport to go get them.  
D) You tell them they have full access to information.  
E) You tell them they have whatever resources they need.  
  
If not, that says it all.

If they are not trying to figure this out, then there is some \*reason\* they are not trying to resolve this. But I see no signs of trying to quickly resolve this‚Ä¶even if the claim is that it is a panic or mass psychosis.

Iran  
Israel  
Ukraine  
S. Lebanon  
Yemen  
  
All in play at the same time.  
  
The U.S. has something like 11 Carrier Strike Groups. At some point, this becomes opportunistic, as the game theory goes multipolar. Similar to when police forces or hospitals are stretched by surge demand.

Who is the de facto commander in chief?  
  
It can‚Äôt be Biden.  
  
Same question I have been asking since the 2020 election. I know it‚Äôs boring. But it matters. And it could matter a whole lot more on \*very\* short notice.  
  
Let‚Äôs hope it doesn‚Äôt go that way.

I‚Äôve never seen war. I have seen peacetime and peacetime extraction.  
  
Joe Biden is a peacetime president.  
  
Think about what is going on and reaction times in the era of hypersonics.  
  
Should more theaters enter into play (e.g. N Korea, Taiwan) The person at the helm needs to be 100% percent present with razor sharp decision making on low information.  
  
On very little sleep. Night after night.  
  
Now watch this again:

Folks are always confused why the Democratic Party is my party.  
  
Why doesn‚Äôt John Wick just get a new dog?  
  
Why doesn‚Äôt Ulysses find a wife with fewer suitors?  
  
Why doesn‚Äôt Israel move to Beverly Hills?  
  
Why doesn‚Äôt Shackleton accept reality?  
  
Why does Shifu train a Panda?  
  

  

I don‚Äôt get it.  
  
Do you want every last one of us who sees the madness to be driven out of your loyal opposition party? Really??  
  
I don‚Äôt like bullies. I don‚Äôt like cowards who bully in groups. I don‚Äôt like psychopaths who wander around wearing the robes of authority and wisdom.

Not every liberal is a commie. Not every progressive is a revolutionary. Not everyone who wants life to be fairer for working families is a Bolshevik.  
  
If the psychopathic left wants my pro-market, pro-merit, pro-free speech progressive sliver, they will have to come and take it. And then we will see. I don‚Äôt love my odds, but you aren‚Äôt making my life any easier by lobbing insults as if I‚Äôm too dumb to know what I‚Äôm up against. I‚Äôd rather you ask: ‚ÄúHow can we help?‚Äù. But you do you.  
  
I‚Äôm damn proud of what is left of my sliver of the Left. And you on the right have come around to appreciate a lot of what we accomplished together as loyal constructive opposition to each other over the years.  
  
Ask yourself if you are better off with one more ‚ÄúWhy I left the Left.‚Äù article.  
  
I‚Äôd settle for ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù and a little help and encouragement given the fire from the DNC party leaders and character assassins. But‚Ä¶y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶suit yourselves. If you wanna help the psychos that‚Äôs your call. Go Dodger Blue!  
  
Ain‚Äôt freedom grand. That‚Äôs America to me. üôè
