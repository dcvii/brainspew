Doodad Pro is the most famous resident in Nunda.

And ever since ‘he’ donated thousands of dollars to Barack Obama’s campaign, people cannot get enough of him.

Unfortunately, it appears Doodad Pro does not exist.

According to an article in the Oct. 13 issue of Newsweek, Obama’s war chest benefited from $17,130 in $10 and $25 dollar increments from a person named Doodad Pro of Nunda and over $11,000 from Good Will of Austin, Texas. The problem is that these identities cannot be confirmed, according to Newsweek. Neither name had ever been publicly reported because both individuals made online donations. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) informed the campaign it had to returned the money received from the unnamed donors. The money was returned using the credit card numbers used for the donations. 

The address listed by donor Doodad Pro — 10 North State St. — happens to be the same address as Lloyd & Lynn's Liquor & Wine in Nunda. Lloyd and Lynn Kirwan said they did not make the donation and are shocked by recent media inquires about who did.

“I got call from the magazine last Friday asking about Doodad Pro, I told them I didn’t know what they heck they were talking about ... the whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion,” said Lloyd Kirwan as he described the sudden interest in his store’s address. He said that a store called Doodad's Boutique was located next to the liquor store, but closed last year. The store was a consignment clothing store with knick-knacks for sale operated by Patricia Cutler of Nunda, who was not available for comment. Now, there is a real estate business in its place. The building used to be a hardware store in the 1980s, but split into two store fronts some time after it closed. The building is owned by Tom Byrnes.

Kirwan said he is not the one who donated the money, but has been asked about Doodad Pro before.

“About six months ago we had local police come to the store and report that a Doodad Pro had ordered sporting goods merchandise from this address,” said Kirwan. That was the first time he heard of Doodad Pro.

“A few weeks ago people who said they were state sale tax representatives asked about the whereabouts of Doodad Pro,” he said, adding, “This is the third instance I’ve been asked about such a person, I don’t know whether it’s a case of business theft or identity theft, but something is definitely going here.

“My next step is to have the owner of the building change my address,” said Kirwan. “You’d think if they wanted to find this person they would just track down the credit card. I don’t even own a credit card."

Contributions of $10 or $25 do not need to be publicly revealed by the campaigns because they do not exceed $200. This is why a donor can fraudulently use any name or address for small online donations. Obama's campaign said the money has been returned to the donor because it exceeded the $2,300 per-person federal campaign donation limit, according to the article in Newsweek. The FEC is in the process of auditing Obama’s small donations.

Last year, Obama's campaign refused to offer any information about its small donors to campaign watchdog groups while the McCain campaign posted the information on its Website and supports measures to make campaign funding more transparent. Obama has raised more than $450 million of campaign money amidst scrutiny of the authenticity and legitimacy of his smaller donors.

The Newsweek article reported that earlier this year, the Obama campaign returned $33,000 to two Palestinian brothers in the Gaza Strip who had bought a huge portion of Tee shirts from the campaign's online store. The men had listed their address as Ga., which the campaign thought was Georgia and not Gaza.
