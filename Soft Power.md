The last 45 years or so has been dominated by the young man on the right of this photo – the one putting the flower in the barrel of the rifle held by the young man on the left.  
Soft power – both the kind that relies on moral suasion for power, and the kind that argues against power (in all forms but its own) – has dominated our social and political relations, and even where hard power – the kind that relies on “do this or we’ll kill you” – has shown itself, it has been curtailed by deference to soft power.  
  
Why has that happened?  
  
In my mind, the answer is super complex and pass through Habermas’ arguments in ‘Legitimation Crisis’ – but in practice are simple. We saw ourselves in the West as unboundedly wealthy and powerful, and decided that what those things allowed was to consume the wealth and degrade the power in order to be good – or, better, to see ourselves as good.  
  
And what we did was to cheer on an elite that removed the cultural and political checks that maintained that wealth and power – ultimately to enrich and entrench themselves, while wrapping their greed in the language of moral goodness – and in so doing lost touch with reality.  
  
One of my favorite films is Terry Gilliam’s ‘Baron Munchausen’ – it’s a hot mess, but every moment is just enjoyable (note: the unveiling of a nude, youthful, Uma Thurman has _nothing_ to do with my opinion).  
  
In the film, one of the major bits is a take on the siege of Vienna, in which The Sultan is opposed by The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson (brilliantly played by Jonathan Pryce). Jackson is the very model of modern administrative leftism (he’s presented with Sting, playing a heroic soldier – and sends him off to be executed, because he can’t have his soldiers being unreasonably brave).  
  
And so Jackson is shown having an insane negotiating back and forth with the Sultan on whose turn it is to attack and explaining that as it is Wednesday (I’m going from memory), it’s his turn to win. The Sultan, a pragmatist, is baffled by all this, and simply keeps demanding his surrender.  
  
Jackson’s model of the world can work – as long as the Sultan is powerless (or, as in the film, defeated by a Munchausen and his allies).  
  
Well, that’s not true any more, and the young man on the left is going to have his generation. And that scares the crap out of me, and infuriates me at all those who have made it necessary.
