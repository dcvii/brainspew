BASTROP, Texas — A few years back, a contractor doing some renovation work for my in-laws told a strange story. He claimed he had been called out to meet the representative of a businessman who wanted to build some houses near Bastrop, 30 miles south of Austin, Texas. As he was discussing the project details, he sensed that somebody was standing behind him. When he turned around, he saw the richest man in the world.

As far as Texas tall tales go, it was almost perfect, and yet I thought it was probably true. This was back when Elon Musk was just starting to move his companies out of California; long before he went all-in on Trump. The contractor turned the job down. He told my in-laws he preferred to do business with his neighbors, though I suspect the real reason is he wasn’t great at his job and feared Musk’s lawyers would have fed him through a woodchipper if he messed things up.

In the three or four years since, Musk’s presence in Texas, and Bastrop in particular, has only grown. Both X and The Boring Company, his tunnel-building venture, are officially headquartered there, directly across the road from Project Echo, a 500,000-square-foot building that SpaceX uses to manufacture Starlink terminals. All this in a small town that, 10 years ago, had just over 8,000 residents, and proudly bore the sobriquet of “[the most historic small town in Texas](https://www.visitbastrop.com/plan/).” Until very recently, I primarily associated Bastrop with the [Dinosaur Park](https://www.thedinopark.com/) located on its outskirts.

In 2023, *The* *Wall Street Journal* raised eyebrows when it reported that Musk was planning to build his own town, to be called Snailbrook, in Bastrop County, describing the proposed development as a “[Texas utopia](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-texas-town-52386513).” Then, late last year, word got out that he had secured permission [to open a new Montessori school](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/elon-musks-ad-astra-montessori-school-permit-to-open-bastrop-county/269-22f51286-34cc-4349-9355-653f96910f65) in Bastrop with a focus on STEM subjects. Still, no comparisons to Mr. Cadbury, the chocolate maker who [built a utopia](https://www.ediblegeography.com/the-towns-that-chocolate-built/) for his workers, have been forthcoming, and that is as it should be: Neither Musk nor his companies have expressed a desire to turn this town into paradise. I think he’s just realized that if you build a factory close to a high-growth, increasingly expensive city like Austin, your workers need somewhere affordable to live.

Many are the tech companies that have opened offices in the Austin area over the past two decades. But Musk’s ventures in and around Bastrop were accompanied by uniquely [sensationalist coverage](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/elon-musk-bastrop-texas-boring-neighbour-8lwqxmk2v), featuring tales of the “heartbreaking” destruction of a rural way of life, and complaints that Musk is building a company town rather than cheap housing. His headline-grabbing attempts to take a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy have, for a time, overshadowed his activities in Texas. Yet Musk’s stint in Washington was always destined to be brief: As a special government employee, he is limited to just [130 days](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5293124/special-government-employee-trump-musk-doge) of service a year. Sure enough, [he announced](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/business/elon-musk-lasting-brand-damage-tesla-doge#:~:text=Elon%20Musk%20says%20he's%20going,two%20days%20a%20week%20there.) a few weeks ago that he’ll soon be stepping back from his government role and shifting his focus back to his ailing private businesses, and in particular Tesla, which is headquartered in Austin. In Texas, his influence is only set to grow.

So, what exactly was he building out there? I decided to see for myself.

Musk’s ventures in and around Bastrop were accompanied by uniquely sensationalist coverage, featuring tales of the “heartbreaking” destruction of a rural way of life, and complaints that Musk is building a company town rather than cheap housing.

The drive from Austin took me through Webberville (population: 483), before a sudden turn transported me into the future. Directly ahead lay Project Echo, gleaming white in the spring sunshine, as if a vast, elongated spaceship had come down to land in a Texas cow pasture. The factory is capable of producing [90,000 Starlink terminals](https://www.advanced-television.com/2024/09/10/starlink-texas-factory-capable-of-4-68m-terminals-annually/) a week. Across the road stands Hyperloop Plaza, named after a transportation system [first proposed](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/blog_images/hyperloop-alpha.pdf) by Musk in 2013 that would propel passengers along tubes in electric pods at 600 miles an hour. I parked amid the Ford, GMC, and Ram trucks—there were no Teslas—and set about investigating.

Despite the futuristic-sounding name, it all looks very ordinary, consisting of two metal warehouse buildings, a food truck, a kids’ play park, a tennis court, and a medical center. Behind a tall fence stands The Boring Company building, and behind *that* I spotted a handful of trailers—this is Snailbrook, Musk’s so-called utopian town. One day, it is projected to contain 110 family homes, but right now it looks like a barracks: You could maybe house 20 employees there.

One of the metal buildings is surrounded by “private property” signs, while the other, the Boring Bodega, appears to be a grocery store. When I entered, I discovered it was so much more than that. The Boring Bodega contains a bar (“The Prufrock Pub”), a merch stand (Musk’s “[Tunnel Mars” T-shirt](https://www.boringcompany.com/tunnelmars) was only available in XXXL, alas), a hair salon, the Cutterhead Candy Co., and the Cafe Monet, where employees are encouraged to relieve stress through the medium of pottery. The main event at the moment was Grace’s second birthday party. Several burly dudes with beards were present, which led me to conclude that Grace’s dad works for The Boring Company.

As I sat down to eat my lunch (grilled cheese and ham sandwich, $7.50), a bored granddad wandered away from Grace’s second birthday party to make conversation about his days in the Marines with two men sitting behind me—one of whom blamed his mother for his failure to participate in any of America’s wars, for he would surely have done so were it not for her objections. Every now and then, somebody in a SpaceX T-shirt came by and ordered a cold brew. At one point, a local walked past with a baby goat in a pram.

Everything felt calm, quiet, private, as if the outside world did not exist: a company town on Mars. It was curiously unsettling after a week of anti-Elon rage, during which a Tesla dealership had been [firebombed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWlOQ278HN0), and irate liberals had started [scratching swastikas](https://abcnews.go.com/US/tesla-cybertruck-vandalized-swastika-nyc-police/story?id=120253990) into Cybertrucks, as if mere ownership of a Musk vehicle was a sign that you loved fascism.

“Do you get a lot of visitors?” I asked the woman behind the counter.

“During the week, yes. But on the weekends, it’s mainly employees and their families.”

“What about Elon haters? Do any of them ever come out here?”

Her eyes light up: “Oh yes.”

I press for details. “What do they do?”

I couldn’t imagine they would get violent, because the employees of The Boring Company looked like they knew how to handle themselves. “Nothing too extreme, I hope?”

After a pause, her eyes darted to the customer behind me. No more details were forthcoming. I took my [Moon Cheese](https://mooncheese.com/collections/space-spice#:~:text=Embark%20on%20an%20Interstellar%20Flavor,crunch%20that's%20impossible%20to%20resist.) and left.

The road to downtown Bastrop takes me past The Colony, a sprawling housing development of large, air-conditioned boxes on tiny lots. The center, by contrast, has an abundance of old houses and buildings. Two Confederate monuments stand in front of the county courthouse, while next door stands the old county jail.

“Everything felt calm, quiet, private, as if the outside world did not exist: a company town on Mars,” writes Daniel Kalder.

In the local museum, I meet Frank Huffman, a local tour guide who recently moved to The Colony. A paleoanthropologist by profession, he is deeply interested in how Bastrop had developed over time. (Not only thanks to Musk: The population of Bastrop County increased [from 58,000](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TXBAST1POP) in 2000 to 102,000 by the time Musk made his first land purchase in the area in 2021. Since then, it has grown to 115,000.) Huffman described how lumber was once the mainstay of the economy—until 2011, when [a fire](https://tpwd.texas.gov/spdest/findadest/parks/bastrop/fire/) ripped through the area, destroying 1,600 homes and laying waste to much of Bastrop’s famous pine forests. That’s when the county shifted to tech. Musk’s arrival a decade later was a significant part of that development, said Huffman, though he thinks The Boring Company is “inconsequential in the long term.” The SpaceX plant pumping out Starlink terminals and the immense [Tesla Gigafactory](https://www.tesla.com/giga-texas) in neighboring Travis County are another matter.

The previous summer, Huffman explained, everybody “was really high on Musk.” In his own neighborhood, he estimates that “75-percent plus” residents are Republican voters who welcome Musk’s attempts to make the federal government more efficient. “But there is a huge downturn in his public approval in much of the community,” Huffman explained, and “considerable fear” that Musk has the power “to take over county government.” It’s not that anybody expects Musk to become the overlord of Bastrop—simply the age-old concern about the influence of money on politics.

“You would think a business that size would do a lot of public relations in the community,” Huffman said. “But I haven’t received anything that I would consider public relations. It’s not a good place to start, because at some point, you need your neighbors to be happy that you’re there.”

Drive more than an hour from any major Texas city and you will soon discover that the state is full of decaying small towns with historic centers. Each one was founded with optimism, but history passed them by. There may be some farmwork, a gas station, and a Dairy Queen, but jobs are scarce and young people have little choice but to leave. Bastrop, on the other hand, has a future. It is not difficult to see why everyone I spoke to was keen to stress they were neither anti-development nor anti-Elon, even if they sometimes wished his companies were better at following regulations or simply communicating what they were up to.

At the end of Main Street, I followed the road down to the Colorado River, where I met Catherine and Arash, who were out taking their dog for a walk. They work at a local drug rehab facility that treats people from all over Texas. “A lot of people come here to get away from it,” said Catherine, “from the coastal areas and up in the Panhandle area. It’s very rural, out in the country, so they really can escape or at least cut themselves off from temptations.” Yet that splendid isolation is starting to erode. Catherine told me that one negative consequence of Bastrop’s development is the arrival of big-city problems. “The homeless population is starting to migrate more here.” The local “church set” has become involved, she said, and started ministering to the homeless.

Arash, meanwhile, is no fan of Musk. “I can admire the brain on the guy, but other than that, not so much. I mean, the jobs he’s taking from people, he’s automating everything—and then this mass deportation . . . ” Arash acknowledges that the deportations are not the direct work of Musk, but “coming from a family of Muslim Mexican descent, I can’t get on board.” Yet he doesn’t expect the local political culture to change: “Texas is gonna be Texas.”

It was Arash, too, who told me of the Musk sightings—the people who frequently claim to see him driving by in his Cybertruck. I liked that; it made him sound like [Hārūn al-Rashīd](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Harun-al-Rashid), the eighth-century caliph who traveled about his kingdom incognito so that he might better understand the concerns of his people.

Arash wasn’t having any of it, though: “Yeah, those are pretty tinted windows.”
