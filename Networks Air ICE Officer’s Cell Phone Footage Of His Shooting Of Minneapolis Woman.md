Cable networks again analyzed an ICE officer’s shooting of a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman, this time with the new angle from footage that was taken by the federal agent.

On social media, the footage was quickly cited by Vice President as evidence that the officer acted in self defense in the incident, which occurred on Wednesday.

But others quickly argued the opposite, even pointing to a comment that the woman, Renee Good, made to the officer just before she was shot: “That’s fine dude, I am not mad at you.” While Vance said that the video shows that Good’s vehicle struck the officer, others noted that it showed her turning right, and away, from him.

The video also shows ICE interactions with another woman, who appears to be Good’s wife, Rebecca. She is heard speaking to the ICE officers, at one point saying to the agent, “You want to come at us? You want to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead.”

### Watch on Deadline

The officer has been identified by the Minnesota Star Tribune and other outlets as Jonathan Ross. Other videos showed him holding a cell phone camera before he fired the three shots, which are heard but not seen. In the latest video, as her car accelerates toward the curbside and other vehicles, a voice can be heard saying, “f—ing bitch.”

, a rightward news site in Minnesota, posted the video on Friday afternoon, saying that they had obtained the footage.

On , , chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, noted that the video shows other agents saying, “Out of the car. Out of the car.”

“And then you see the car go into gear,” he said. “It sounds like the car strikes the agent. We can’t see that because we know from the other angle, two things are happening right then. Number one, the hand with the phone is going down, and number two, the hand with the gun is coming up. So it appears from that angle that he takes these shots with one hand.”

He added, “Part of what we learned is we can’t make assumptions only from the other videos. You really have to look at all of them and come to some collective forensic judgment with those comparisons.”

He also said that the video still leaves a lot of remaining questions, including why the agent was recording with his phone, and why Good was being told to get out of the car.

“Is he going to initiate an arrest? If he is going to initiate an arrest, is it for this car blocking the road? Is it for some earlier contact they had with them?” Miller said.

NewsNation also aired the video, with Geraldo Rivera offering analysis as well as senior national correspondent Brian Entin and former federal prosecutor David Weinstein. Rivera has been critical of ICE’s conduct, and wrote on X of the latest video, “New cell phone footage from the tragic incident in Minneapolis does nothing to change my mind. The killing of Renee Good was entirely unnecessary.”

The shooting has led to protests in Minneapolis and other cities. Minnesota officials said on Thursday that the FBI is taking the lead on the investigation and freezing out state investigators.

Vance posted the latest footage and wrote on X, “Watch this, as hard as it is. Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn’t hit by a car, wasn’t being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted, “The media smeared an ICE Agent who properly defended himself from being run over by organized leftist protesters who were impeding an active law enforcement operation. The reason trust in the media is at an all-time low is because they intentionally lie to the public to advance the Democrats’ narrative.”

Leavitt did not point to specific reporting on the incident that she found objectionable.

Many media outlets have merely reported on what the video footage has captured and the community outrage afterward, in addition to the administration’s claims that the woman was engaged in an act of domestic terrorism.

Some commentators have noted that the video shows how quickly ICE agents escalated the situation, as one of the officers tells Good to “Get out of the f–ing car.” They also challenge that the video proves that the car struck the ICE agent. At that moment he can be heard saying “whoa” as his camera shoot upward and shots are heard.

Former GOP Rep. Justin Amash posted on X that the latest video “is consistent with previous footage. The phone shakes when he abandons filming to move and fire his gun. The administration’s effort to mislead the public by claiming this somehow justifies shooting Renee Good is appalling.”

Fomrer GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger wrote, “So an officer has his phone out recording obviously distracted, shoots a woman and calls her a ‘f’ing Bitch’ and they think that HELPS the case?!?”
