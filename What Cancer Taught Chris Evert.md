***Welcome back to** [Ancient Wisdom](https://www.thefp.com/t/ancient-wisdom)**, our Sunday series in which writers over 70 tell us how they are aging gracefully. Last week, the novelist and playwright Anthony Giardina, 74, [wrote about](https://www.thefp.com/p/ancient-wisdom-the-world-says-quit-novelist-ambition) why he’s not ready to hang it up. This week, tennis great Chris Evert, 70, writes about surviving cancer—and how it changed her.***

You have to be selfish when you play an individual sport like tennis.

I started playing junior tournaments when I was eight years old, turned professional in 1972 when I was 18, and retired in 1989 at the age of 34. During that time—a span of almost three decades—I was always preparing for the next match, the next tournament. By the time I stopped playing, I was tired of being so focused on myself. I know there are athletes who have a hard time moving on after their career is over, but that wasn’t me. For most people, retirement is something that happens in their 60s, not their 30s. But I’d sacrificed so much for tennis that I was ready to embrace everything else that life had to offer. Instead of viewing retirement as a chapter ending, I saw it as a whole world opening up.

I wanted to have children, and I did: three boys in the space of five years. Motherhood gave me so much joy. Sometimes I would be approached about making a comeback or playing [World TeamTennis](https://wtt.com/), but I always said no. I wanted to spend every minute with my kids. Thanks to my tennis earnings, I didn’t have to worry about money, so I had the luxury of choice. I could wake up every day and do what I wanted. I was married to [Andy Mill](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/andy-mill), an Olympic downhill skier, for 20 years. We had homes in Boca Raton, where I grew up, and Aspen, where he grew up. We had a good life.

I became involved with the Women’s Tennis Association, which has always maintained close ties to former players, and which for me felt like a kind of sisterhood. And I kept track of the players I had competed against. After all, they were my friends too: Martina Navratilova, Monica Seles, Pam Shriver. And [Billie Jean King](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Battle-of-the-Sexes-tennis), who paved the way for all of us in women’s tennis, was a friend too. Fifteen years ago, when I was 55, I became a commentator. Newly single, with my kids out of the house, I needed something that would keep me engaged.

My brother John and I started the Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton shortly after I retired. When my kids were small, I wasn’t on the premises much, but as they grew up and I had more free time, I started going every day. I became a mentor to the young players, especially the young women, listening to them and advising them. Whenever you have big experiences in life, that creates wisdom, and I had tennis wisdom. I’ve been in so many demanding situations, under so much pressure, that I could talk to them about dealing with and handling stress. I found that kind of mentoring very fulfilling. I found my whole life fulfilling.

Then I got cancer.

I was diagnosed in December 2021, at the age of 67. It was ovarian cancer. The day I received my diagnosis, my sister Clare said to me, “You’re going to have six weeks of chemotherapy and you’re going to be tired and you’re going to have a lot of free time. Why don’t you make good use of that and do some therapy?” So I found Lillian, a therapist who I’ve talked to twice a week for the last three years. She’s been so helpful, even after I was in remission. It’s something I wish I had done earlier in my life.

Cancer can be a lonely disease. I did think about dying at first; it’s hard not to. My sister Jeanne, who was three years younger than me, died of ovarian cancer in February 2020. Because of that family history, I was diligent about my checkups. I had a preventive hysterectomy, and that’s when the doctors found my cancer. They said they found it in my ovaries and my fallopian tube, but they needed to perform another surgery to see if it had spread. Waiting for those results were the longest three days of my life. I didn’t know whether it would be stage one or stage four. Fortunately, it was stage one, which was a great relief. But that still meant I had a long way to go before I was out of the woods.

When I was going through chemo, people would always come up to me and say, “You’re so brave. I don’t know how you do it.” And I’d look at them and say, “What’s the alternative? What else can you do?” I told them, “You would do the same thing.” It didn’t matter that I’m a well-known athlete who is fit and healthy; I’m one of the millions of people around the world who have cancer, and receive chemo. When you’re sitting in that room getting chemotherapy pumped into your veins, you can’t help but look around and see all the other people doing the same thing. It makes you humble. And it increases your compassion for people.

It didn’t matter that I’m a well-known athlete who is fit and healthy; I’m one of the millions of people around the world who have cancer, and receive chemo.

Having cancer changed me in some ways. I’m not as anxious as I used to be. I don’t worry about the small stuff anymore. I’m more conscious of what I’m doing at any given moment. I don’t want to have any drama. I try to keep out negative thoughts. And I let things go. For me, the expression *life is too short* has taken on new meaning. I remind myself now of how grateful I am for everything I’ve been given in life.

The chances of a recurrence were supposed to be pretty small, yet my cancer came back about a year after I thought I was done with it. I was frustrated beyond belief. Fortunately, it’s in remission, but in some ways I still have shackles on because after you’ve had cancer twice, the odds of getting it again go up. I have to get a CAT scan every three months for the rest of my life, as well as blood work and a physical examination. So my perception of my life is: *every three months*. I just try to live my fullest life within those three months. I don’t look ahead to one or two years down the road.

I try to push myself to do a few more things that I might not have done as often before. For instance, I’m a grandmother now. I have a 14-month-old grandson, so I fly to Colorado every month to spend a week with him, and that gives me joy. And I still do commentary at the Grand Slam events, like the upcoming U.S. Open that starts a week from today. It is a satisfying feeling when I know I’ve done a good job explaining to people watching at home the mental as well as the physical elements of a match. Preparing to go on the air, thinking about what I’m going to tell tennis fans about the two players ready to go on court, engages my mind. I need that at this point in my life.

In the hospital and the doctor’s office, I’ve met other people with cancer, of course. Some of them are accepting of it, and others seem sad. For my part, I feel fortunate—fortunate that mine was caught early and that I had such great support from my kids, my brother and sister, and my ex-husband Andy. And also Martina, who had cancer at the same time I did. We were able to talk to each other about how the chemo affected each of us, but we could also talk about the mental and emotional aspects of having cancer.

Sometimes, I’ll be doing something to prepare for the next day or the next week, and then it hits me: You better look at the trees. Look at the trees right now. Look at the mountains right now. You might not be healthy next week, but right now you don’t have cancer in your body, and you should feel energy, and you should feel happiness. It can be taken away so quickly.
