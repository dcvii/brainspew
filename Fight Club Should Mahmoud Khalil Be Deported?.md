_**The Trump administration’s effort to deport Mahmoud Khalil has ignited a fierce debate about the limits of free speech and the rights of noncitizens in the United States.**_

_**Khalil, a green card holder, Columbia University graduate, and chief organizer of the anti-Israel campus riots that ensued after October 7, was detained by ICE agents twelve days ago and is currently being held by the U.S. government in a Louisiana jail.**_

_**Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, [said the arrest was](https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-mahmoud-khalil-ice-15014bcbb921f21a9f704d5acdcae7a8) “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting antisemitism,” and connected to “activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”**_

_**As of yesterday, a federal judge [denied the administration’s request](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwygldgjkgyo) to dismiss Khalil’s challenge to his arrest. It’s just the beginning of what is sure to be a long and complicated legal battle.**_

_**We have covered this story extensively in The Free Press. We’ve [broken news](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-ice-detention-of-a-columbia-student) on the administration’s plans to use Khalil’s case as a blueprint for more arrests. Yale Law professor Jed Rubenfeld explained the [thorny legal complexities](https://www.thefp.com/p/both-left-and-right-are-wrong-about) that make this such a challenging case.**_

_**But there’s a more important, more basic question than whether deporting Khalil is technically legal, or how the government might go about doing it, and that is: Would his deportation be good or bad for America? Just because the government**_ **can** _**do something—and in this case, that is fiercely contested—doesn’t mean it**_ **should**_**.**_

_**Is deportation a reasonable exercise of our national sovereignty to protect the United States from somebody who despises—and wants to destroy—our culture and values?**_

_**Or is this a disturbing move intended to chill political speech—including by Americans—that violates one of our most precious freedoms?**_

_**Those are the questions debated in today’s installment of Free Press Fight Club.**_

_**Arguing in favor of Khalil’s deportation is Hussein Aboubakr Mansour, [senior fellow](https://jcpa.org/researcher/hussein-aboubakr-mansour/) at the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. He sees the move as a righteous act of self-defense. Taking the other side is The Free Press’s Eli Lake, who despises everything Khalil stands for, but believes his detention sets a dangerous precedent.**_

**First up, Hussein Aboubakr Mansour:**

Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian-born Palestinian, came to this country in 2022 as a guest, ostensibly to study at Columbia University. While here, he spent his time organizing campus protests in support of Hamas and Hezbollah, both officially designated by the United States as foreign terrorist organizations. In these riots, buildings were vandalized, windows smashed, classes disrupted, and students threatened with physical harm.

Had Khalil disclosed his plans when applying for a visa, he would have been deemed inadmissible from the outset.

The Trump administration’s decision to revoke his green card and deport him is a prudent act of self-defense, a necessary safeguard against a very real threat to the United States.

Let me be clear: This is not a case about free speech. The heart of the problem lies not in Khalil’s words, but in his _actions_.

He is not some wide-eyed idealist who uttered unpopular opinions or scribbled inflammatory op-eds. In fact, [he served](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university.html) as the “negotiator” for Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a student organization that gleefully cheers for “[the total eradication of Western civilization](https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/us-news/columbia-universitys-anti-israel-group-seeking-total-eradication-of-western-civilization/).”

CUAD is the primary agent of the chaos that has roiled Columbia since October 7, including assaults on [janitorial workers](https://www.thefp.com/p/exclusive-columbia-custodian-trapped) and [Jewish students](https://www.thefp.com/p/they-were-assaulted-on-campus-for). This is a determined, persistent anarchist enterprise aided by Khalil who, while enjoying the privileges of American residency, helped to spread support for terrorist organizations that have a documented history of kidnapping and killing U.S. citizens.

Now, I hear the chorus of defenders of free speech, many of whom, ironically, were silent as the Democratic Party built its censorship and misinformation-industrial complex through the years. While it is true the First Amendment places robust constraints on government action against expression, it does not require the government to confer or maintain legal immigration status upon a noncitizen who promotes lethal hostility against us and our allies. Khalil’s groups actively distributed flyers, [released by the White House](https://nypost.com/2025/03/11/us-news/mahmoud-kalil-columbia-anti-israel-agitator-being-deported-over-pro-hamas-flyers-white-house/) for all to see, glorifying the October 7 massacre, celebrating its mastermind, Yahya Sinwar, and threatening to “crush Zionism.”

A green card is a grant of privilege—an invitation to participate in the American project under certain mutually understood terms. The power to revoke that privilege rests with the American public through its constitutional processes precisely because we expect immigrants to respect the foundational principles of our society. If an individual devotes himself to undermining or violently dismantling our culture and institutions, that is a fundamental breach of the agreement he entered into when seeking to live here.

Radical ideology may be tolerated on our campuses, but direct involvement in financing, organizing, or championing violent and murderous insurgencies aimed at destroying our national core should never be.

This is the crucial distinction. Khalil is not being targeted for deportation because he harbors vile personal views. In that case, we would also deport most of the Third World postcolonial “scholars” our universities love and cherish. He is being targeted because his views have manifested in an active, operational context. He stands squarely in the realm of “clear and present danger.”

As Secretary of State Marco Rubio [explained](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-mahmoud-khalil-arrest-face-the-nation/), acting as a spokesperson for a group that destroys property, harasses students and workers, and distributes pro-terror propaganda is “a crime in and of itself. . . . If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.”

American sovereignty includes the right to disinvite those who habitually stoke violence against us. Yes, strong free-speech protections are integral to our national identity. But no tradition—least of all ours—obligates us to retain in our midst someone who actively coordinates support for terrorist organizations devoted to kidnapping and killing.

The line must be drawn somewhere, and Khalil’s conduct places him well on the wrong side of that boundary. If he imagines that “Western civilization” is something to be obliterated, he can do so from outside our borders, without the benefit of American hospitality and legal status. That is the fairest—and frankly, the most American—outcome possible.

**Next up, Eli Lake:**

Mahmoud Khalil was a spokesman for CUAD, whose activism is in solidarity with Hamas, the party that initiated the latest war in Gaza in an act of grotesque savagery on October 7. The group took over Hamilton Hall last spring, smashed windows, and held a [janitor hostage](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13368143/columbia-university-janitor-protest-hamilton-hall.html). It coordinated a tent encampment on the quad that deliberately excluded “Zionists,” and has sought to shout down speakers whose opinions it opposes. To put it mildly, I have no sympathy for Khalil and his comrades. They deserve the belated and harsh penalties Columbia is [now imposing](https://abcnews.go.com/US/columbia-university-students-occupied-hamilton-hall-expelled-suspended/story?id=119774163) on CUAD’s ringleaders.

So it might surprise you that I also think the Trump administration’s effort to deport Khalil, who is a permanent legal resident of the United States, sets a horrifying precedent for free speech in America.

This is because the government’s rationale for deporting him is not that he committed property crimes. It’s not that he provided material support to Hamas. Nor is it that he coordinated his or CUAD’s activities directly with Hamas.

The reason Khalil is being deported is because of his speech.

Here is how the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Troy Edgar, [explained it](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/nx-s1-5326015/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-arrests-trump) earlier this month: “We’ve invited and allowed the student to come into the country, and he’s put himself in the middle of the process of basically pro-Palestinian activity. And at this point, like I said, the Secretary of State can review his visa process at any point and revoke it.”

“Pro-Palestinian activity”? That amounts to a kind of thought crime.

The First Amendment is not only a privilege of American citizenship. It is a strict limitation on the federal government. It is the law of our land. And the [Supreme Court](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5323208/what-rights-do-green-card-holders-have-in-the-u-s) has ruled that most Constitutional protections, including the First Amendment, apply to green card holders. The government may not arrest, detain, or deport permanent legal residents solely because of what they say.

And yet, that is what the Trump administration is doing. This authority to deport Khalil stems from a provision of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act. It [states that](https://www.womenslaw.org/laws/federal/statutes/ina-ss-237-8-usc-ss-1227-deportable-aliens) any “alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.”

Perhaps the Supreme Court will create a new precedent when it comes to green card holders. But even if that were to happen, it’s important to understand what an erosion of our liberties this would represent.

Imagine if a future Democratic president determined that green card holders who oppose youth gender medical transitions undermined U.S. foreign policy. Would the MAGA right be so quick to defend this 1952 statute in those circumstances? Put another way, the free speech exceptions one makes today will become a threat to your speech tomorrow. Better to protect all speech, even the speech one despises.

More yet, there is no precedent that I have found in the last 50 years where a green card holder was deported solely on the grounds that his or her speech undermined U.S. foreign policy.

This novel interpretation of the immigration statute is similar to the abuses of Democrats and the administrative state during the first Trump term. Consider the hysteria around Michael Flynn’s [alleged violation](https://www.commentary.org/articles/eli-lake/michael-flynn-gets-railroaded-by-the-fbi/) of the John Adams–era law known as the [Logan Act](https://www.britannica.com/event/Logan-Act). Flynn, who was briefly Trump’s first national security adviser, had met with Russia’s ambassador to Washington during the presidential transition. The FBI and Democrats at the time argued that this routine meeting between a future senior official and Russia’s ambassador violated the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from engaging in foreign policy. Never mind that the law had never been successfully prosecuted and that this interpretation would make nearly all presidential transitions illegal. The Democrats wanted Flynn’s scalp, and they didn’t care how they got it.

A similar kind of reasoning animates the case against Khalil. He was involved in stoking riots and intimidating Jewish students on campus. If there is a law on the books that the government can use to deport him, why not use it?

The answer is that we don’t punish speech that is unconnected to criminal activities in America. It’s a limitation on our government that has served our country well over the last 234 years. The arguments for Israel’s defensive war against genocidal terrorists is strong enough that it can withstand the loathsome speech of those who take the other side.
