## What was the beginning of it all?

Putting tennis balls in bike spokes is said to date back to the early days of BMX racing. Bikes were not as advanced as they are today, and riders had to get creative to make their bikes go faster. One way that they did this was by putting tennis balls in their spokes. The theory is that the tennis balls would create a cushion for the spoke, allowing the wheel to spin more quickly.

There is no definitive proof that this actually works, but it is still a widespread practice among BMX riders today. Some people believe that it makes the ride smoother, while others think that it makes the bike look cooler. Whatever the reason, there is no doubt that tennis balls in bike spokes are here to stay.

### The cons of tennis balls in bike spokes

While tennis balls in bike spokes may look cool, this practice has some drawbacks.

One of the biggest problems is that the tennis balls can eventually fall out, which can be dangerous for the rider.

Another issue is a drag. Tennis balls have a fuzzy surface that adds drag when the ball is in motion.

This phenomenon is considered advantageous in tennis, but it has a detrimental influence on the aerodynamic qualities of a wheel. In other words, the top layer makes it more difficult for the wheel to spin.

Extra weight is also something to consider. Tennis balls are not as light as air, and they will add weight to the bike. This can be a problem for racing, where every ounce counts.

### The pros of tennis balls in bike spokes

While there are some drawbacks to putting tennis balls in your spokes, some advantages are also.

One of the biggest benefits is that it can help to absorb shock. This is especially useful for BMX riders who often ride on rough terrain. The tennis balls can help protect the spoke from damage and prevent the wheel from being damaged.

Tennis balls can also help to quiet down a noisy bike. If you have ever been bothered by the sound of your own bike, then you know how annoying it can be. Tennis balls can help reduce the chainâ€™s noise and make your ride more pleasant.

Finally, tennis balls can add a bit of personality to your bike. They come in various colors and patterns, so you can really make your bike stand out from the crowd.
