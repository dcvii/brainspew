#### CPU Benchmark

Geekbench 6 measures your processor's single-core and multi-core power, for everything from checking your email to taking a picture to playing music, or all of it at once. Geekbench 6's CPU benchmark measures performance in new application areas including Augmented Reality and Machine Learning, so you'll know how close your system is to the cutting-edge.

#### GPU Compute Benchmark

Test your system's potential for gaming, image processing, or video editing with the Compute Benchmark. Test your GPU's power with support for the OpenCL, Metal, and Vulkan APIs. New to Geekbench 6 is a new GPU API abstraction layer and new Machine Learning workloads.
