SPEAKER 1

We need to talk about what it takes to be an actual A plus AI consultant, because I see a lot of people who are either considering that as a career path or actively pursuing it, who aren't able to deliver the kind of extraordinary value that would let them retain clients over the long term. In this video,

0:18

I'm going to talk about what I see as positive behaviors that actually promote long-term value for clients when you're consulting on AI, and also the opposite, things that I see people actually practicing a lot that aren't supportive of the value they're going to need to sustain to have a long-term consulting practice.

0:36

But first, let's find out why everyone's running to the field. It's exploding. Revenues are projected to reach $630 billion in AI consulting alone by 2028. I don't know, that sounds like made up money. It's a lot of money, whether it's 500 billion or a trillion, who knows? It's a big pile of money.

0:54

So people are running at it. Over 50% of large enterprises are already using AI consulting services. And that doesn't even count the small, medium businesses all over this country, the United States, and also the rest of the world who are looking for support on AI, let alone individuals, sole proprietorships, indie hackers, et cetera.

1:14

The vast majority of consulting firms, and I'm not even including AI in that. I'm not saying you'd like segment it down to just AI consulting firms. Consulting firms overall are reporting a bump in demand for AI expertise, which gets us to our first point, which is that winners keep winning. In other words,

> 
> *8\. Sprint Planner maps weekly deliverables and risk buffers.*
> 
> *9\. Feedback Mediator transforms vague notes into precise actions.*
> 
> *10\. Upsell & Testimonial Harvest converts wins into recurring revenue.*

*It’s not just the ten prompts, though. Today’s market demands authentic expertise, not buzzwords or flashy marketing. These principles and prompts provide the clarity and structure you need to deliver real results, build genuine credibility, and decisively differentiate yourself. They will give you a leg up, as long as you’re willing to commit to developing the authentic expertise you need to command genuine authority in your corner of this wild AI world.*

*If you’re willing to commit to developing expertise, I’m committing to provide you the rest of the kit: clear frameworks, strategic insights, and concrete action steps. These prompts and principles will help you swiftly overcome common roadblocks like vague positioning, weak pricing strategies, or ineffective outreach.*

#### [First, here are the 10 prompts to set up consulting end-to-end!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GPMojo4S7Wtut48NkyzqnqRHFfwHRhr4FmUKZyY2Llk/edit?tab=t.0)

# **The $630 Billion AI Consulting Gold Rush Is Creating an Army of Frauds**

*How to build a legitimate AI consulting practice that delivers real value—and avoid the AI-washing trap that's poisoning the entire ecosystem*

## **Executive Summary**

The numbers are staggering. AI consulting revenues are projected to hit $630 billion by 2028. Over 50% of large enterprises are already using AI consulting services. Every consulting firm—not just AI specialists—is reporting surging demand for AI expertise.

Here's the problem: Most of these consultants are frauds.

I don't mean intentional scammers. I mean well-meaning business consultants who've slapped "AI-powered" onto their existing services without understanding what RAG is, when to deploy AI agents, or how to actually implement anything beyond ChatGPT integrations.

This AI-washing epidemic isn't just bad business—it's poisoning the entire ecosystem. Bad implementations are teaching enterprises that AI is overhyped snake oil. I personally know consultants making six figures just cleaning up other consultants' messes.

But there's a different path. Six principles separate legitimate AI consultants from the hucksters flooding the market. Master these, and you'll build sustainable client relationships while the AI-washers burn bridges.

The stakes couldn't be higher. Get this right, and you'll ride the biggest consulting wave in decades. Get it wrong, and you'll kill trust in AI for everyone.

## **The Uncomfortable Truth About Today's AI Consulting Market**

Winners keep winning. That's the first uncomfortable truth about the AI consulting boom.

The consultants making real money aren't AI natives who've spent years mastering transformers and vector databases. They're existing consultancies with established client relationships who've added "AI" to their service menu. Marketing agencies. Process improvement firms. Development shops. Anyone with distribution channels and existing books of business.

Why? Because distribution is still king, even in the AI era.

But here's where it gets ugly. Most of these established consultancies are just AI-washing their existing offerings. They paint the big "AI" sign on their proposals, jack up their rates, and hope nobody asks hard questions.

I've seen this firsthand. A business consultant sits across from a client who asks a perfectly reasonable question: "When should we use RAG versus fine-tuning?" You can watch the consultant's face go blank. They mumble something about "talking to a technical person about that."

That's not a super technical question. Any business consultant selling AI services should have a high-level opinion on retrieval-augmented generation. It's like a marketing consultant not knowing when to use email versus social media.

The temptation is obvious. AI is a general-purpose technology that can theoretically improve everything these consultants already do. Marketing automation becomes "AI-powered marketing." Process improvement becomes "intelligent automation." Team formation becomes "AI-driven organizational design."

Slap some ChatGPT integrations on top, maybe throw in a dashboard with "predictive analytics," and you've got yourself an AI consultancy. Right?

Wrong. Dead wrong.

This approach is burning bridges faster than consultants can build them. I know multiple consultants whose entire practice consists of cleaning up after other consultants' botched AI implementations. One told me he's booked solid through 2026 just fixing what others broke.

The damage goes beyond individual client relationships. Every failed AI project teaches an enterprise that AI is overhyped nonsense. Every consultant who promises "AI transformation" and delivers a glorified Excel macro makes the next legitimate AI consultant's job harder.

We're seeing this trust erosion in real-time. Remember Amazon's "AI-powered" walk-out grocery stores? Turns out it was never really AI—just people in India watching video feeds. That's the kind of revelation that makes CFOs skeptical of any proposal with "AI" in the title.

The cruel irony? There's never been a better time to start a legitimate AI consulting practice. The demand is real. The technology actually works. But you can't fake your way through it anymore.

The market is about to separate the authentic practitioners from the AI-washers. If you’re interested in consulting at all, the question is: which side will you be on?

## **The Six Pillars of Legitimate AI Consulting**

### **1\. Get Brutally Specific (Stop the Buzzword Nonsense)**

"We'll implement an agentic mesh to create AI-powered synergies across your digital transformation."

If you just threw up in your mouth a little, good. That's what legitimate AI sounds like to clients who've been burned by consultant-speak.

The antidote to AI-washing is brutal specificity. Instead of "AI-powered marketing," talk about "using Claude to rewrite your email sequences based on customer response patterns." Instead of "intelligent automation," say "we'll build a system that automatically categorizes support tickets and routes urgent issues to your senior team."

Specificity does two things buzzwords can't: it demonstrates actual expertise, and it helps clients visualize real outcomes.

But here's the deeper principle: you can't be specific about AI without being specific about something else first. AI is a general-purpose technology—like electricity or software—that enhances other capabilities. You need those other capabilities to exist first.

Think of it as the strangler fig principle. Strangler figs grow around existing trees, eventually transforming or replacing them entirely. But they can't grow without that original tree structure. Your AI expertise needs to grow around your existing domain knowledge.

Cursor nailed this approach. Development environments were a boring, commoditized business for decades. Then Cursor wrapped AI around the core IDE experience so elegantly that developers couldn't imagine coding without it. They didn't become "AI consultants"—they became the definitive AI-enabled development platform.

That's your playbook. Own the boring business first. Then make it extraordinary with AI.

### **2\. Own Your Domain Before You Touch AI**

You cannot be a "general AI consultant." It's not a real job.

I see this mistake constantly. Smart people with solid AI technical knowledge try to position themselves as experts on "AI strategy" or "AI transformation" broadly. They fail because clients can't distinguish them from the thousands of other generalists flooding the market.

Instead, pick a domain you already understand deeply. Maybe it's SEO and you've been watching Google's algorithm changes for a decade. Maybe it's clinical operations and you've managed hospital workflows. Maybe it's supply chain logistics, financial planning, or restaurant management.

Whatever it is, own it completely. Then layer AI expertise on top.

I can speak authoritatively about product management and AI because I did product management for years before AI became mainstream. When I explain how AI agents should be deployed in product development workflows, people believe me—not because of my AI knowledge alone, but because of my product credibility.

This domain-first approach also gives you pricing power. Three specific AI offerings beat one general one every time. "AI for emergency medicine," "AI for franchise operations," and "AI for B2B sales teams" are all sellable services. "AI consulting" is not.

The beauty of specificity is that it enables adjacent expansion. Master AI for SEO, and you can credibly extend to AI for paid marketing, then social marketing, then eventually become an AI-enabled marketing consultancy. But that progression only works if you start with deep domain expertise in one vertical.

Don't be afraid of that background. Embrace it. That's not the thing you're pivoting away from—that's your competitive moat.

### **3\. Build Your Distribution Network (Not Just Your LinkedIn)**

Distribution trumps everything else in consulting. The best AI consultant without clients is unemployed. The mediocre consultant with strong relationships stays busy.

But AI consulting makes distribution both easier and harder. Easier because AI touches everything, so your network can expand in multiple directions. Harder because clients are skeptical of AI expertise claims.

The solution: become known for specific, valuable AI insights within your domain. Put your real work out there—within NDA constraints—in ways that help other consultants remember you.

You want to be "that person" other consultants think of for referrals. When a marketing consultant lands a client who needs AI-powered email personalization, you want them to think, "I need to call James." When a process consultant encounters a workflow automation challenge, you want to be their first call.

How do you become that person? Content that demonstrates specific expertise. Not thought leadership fluff about "the future of AI." Tactical breakdowns of how you've implemented specific solutions. Case studies that show measurable results. Technical explanations that prove you actually understand the technology.

This is especially critical now because the AI consulting space is flooded with fraudsters. Clients and other consultants need to separate real expertise from marketing hype. Clear, specific content does that filtering work.

Build partnerships deliberately. Find specialists whose capabilities complement yours. If you're the AI-for-logistics person, you need friends who handle AI for finance, AI for customer service, and AI for operations. Large enterprises want comprehensive AI strategies, not point solutions.

Your network becomes your competitive advantage. When clients expand their AI initiatives—and they will—you want to be positioned to grow with them.

### **4\. Templatize Smartly in the Age of AI**

Every consultant learns about templates eventually. They're how you scale knowledge, reduce delivery time, and create predictable outcomes. But AI changes the template game entirely.

Old-school consulting templates were static frameworks you'd customize manually for each client. Think McKinsey's classic slide decks or Deloitte's assessment matrices. Useful, but labor-intensive to adapt.

AI enables living templates. Prompts that extend automatically based on client context. Frameworks that customize themselves using data the client provides. Assessment tools that adapt their recommendations in real-time.

I've seen consultants build intake forms that feed directly into AI systems that generate preliminary strategic recommendations. The consultant reviews and refines the output, but the heavy lifting of customization happens automatically. The client gets something that feels bespoke, the consultant saves 80% of the prep time.

This isn't about replacing human expertise—it's about augmenting it. The consultant still needs to understand what good strategy looks like, how to facilitate difficult conversations, and when the AI's recommendations miss the mark. But templates can handle much more of the routine analytical work.

The key is starting with solid consulting fundamentals. Your templates need to capture real frameworks that actually work. AI can make them more dynamic and responsive, but it can't fix fundamentally broken methodologies.

Packaging still matters enormously. Clients struggling with AI need clarity about what you're offering and where your engagement boundaries are. Templates help you communicate scope and deliverables in ways clients can understand and budget for.

The difference is that your templates can now be far more sophisticated and client-specific than ever before.

### **5\. Position Yourself in the Value Chain**

AI implementations require multiple specialties working together. You can't be great at everything, and you shouldn't try.

Instead, get very clear about which part of the AI value chain you own, and build relationships with specialists who cover the other parts. Maybe you're excellent at AI strategy but partner with specialists for technical implementation. Maybe you handle data preparation and model training but work with others for change management and user adoption.

This matters more in AI consulting than traditional consulting because AI projects tend to be more technically complex and organizationally disruptive. A typical enterprise AI initiative might require strategy consulting, technical architecture, data engineering, model development, integration work, training, and change management.

No consultant does all of that well. The ones who try usually deliver mediocre results across the board.

Define your lane clearly. "I help retail companies identify high-impact AI use cases and build business cases for executive approval. When it's time for technical implementation, I bring in my partners who specialize in that phase."

This positioning does three things: it makes you better at what you do focus on, it gives you more opportunities through partnerships, and it provides natural expansion paths as clients' needs evolve.

The partnership approach also helps with credibility. When other consultants are willing to stake their reputations on working with you, it signals authenticity in a way no marketing copy can match.

### **6\. Put Your Work Out There (Within NDA Limits)**

Content creation isn't optional for AI consultants anymore. The market is too noisy and too full of fraudsters. You need to prove you know what you're talking about.

But this isn't about thought leadership or personal branding. It's about demonstrating competence in ways that help potential clients and partners evaluate your capabilities.

Share tactical insights from your work. Explain specific AI implementation challenges and how you solved them. Break down technical concepts in ways that business stakeholders can understand. Show your thinking process, not just your conclusions.

Yes, NDAs constrain what you can share. But you can usually discuss methodologies, frameworks, and lessons learned without revealing client-specific details. You can write about "a healthcare system" instead of naming the specific hospital. You can explain your approach to "a logistics optimization project" without disclosing proprietary data.

The goal is helping people map your expertise. When someone has a specific AI challenge, you want them to remember that article where you explained exactly that problem and how to solve it.

This content serves multiple audiences simultaneously. Potential clients see your expertise and approach. Other consultants understand your capabilities for potential partnerships. Talented practitioners evaluate whether they want to work with you.

The quality bar is high because the stakes are high. Publish something that demonstrates shallow thinking, and you'll be grouped with the AI-washers. Publish something that shows deep insight, and you'll stand out from the crowd.

Be generous with your knowledge. The consultants building lasting practices share what they know, connect people with opportunities, and contribute to raising the overall quality of AI implementations.

The ecosystem needs more authentic practitioners and fewer charlatans. Your content can help tip that balance.

## **The Stakes: Why This Matters for Everyone**

The AI consulting failure stories are already piling up, and they're poisoning the well for everyone.

Amazon's "Just Walk Out" grocery stores were supposed to showcase the future of AI-powered retail. Customers would grab items and leave, with AI automatically detecting and charging for purchases. Except it wasn't AI doing the work—it was hundreds of people in India watching video feeds and manually updating shopping carts. When the truth came out, it didn't just embarrass Amazon. It made every retail executive more skeptical of AI vendor promises.

That's the pattern repeating across industries. A consulting firm promises "AI-powered predictive analytics" and delivers basic Excel forecasting with a fancy dashboard. A "machine learning optimization platform" turns out to be hard-coded business rules. An "intelligent automation system" requires constant manual intervention to function.

Each failure teaches decision-makers that AI is overhyped nonsense sold by slick consultants. Those lessons stick. I've sat in meetings where executives immediately dismissed legitimate AI proposals because they'd been burned by previous consultants who overpromised and underdelivered.

The damage compounds because AI adoption requires organizational buy-in. Unlike simple software purchases, AI implementations often require process changes, new workflows, and cultural shifts. When those initiatives fail due to consultant incompetence, companies don't just lose money—they lose momentum. Teams become resistant to future AI projects. Budgets get slashed. Innovation stalls.

Meanwhile, legitimate AI practitioners watch their market get poisoned by amateurs. Sales cycles lengthen as prospects demand extensive proof-of-concepts. Pricing pressure increases as clients assume all AI consultants are basically the same. Trust becomes harder to build and easier to lose.

The consulting-to-consultant cleanup economy is already booming. I know practitioners billing $400+ per hour just to fix what other consultants broke. One specialist told me 70% of his engagements in 2025 start with "We tried AI before and it didn't work." ***70%!*** His first month is always spent rebuilding trust and realistic expectations.

This isn't sustainable. Every botched implementation makes the next consultant's job harder. Every AI-washed proposal that fails to deliver makes enterprises more skeptical of the technology itself.

The irony is brutal: we're in the middle of the most significant productivity revolution since the internet, but bad consulting is convincing decision-makers that it's all hype.

The consultants who get this right will build decade-long client relationships as AI transforms entire industries. The ones who don't will burn out their credibility within 18 months.

Which future are you building toward?

## **Your Next Move**

If you’re involved in consulting at all, stop reading and start auditing. Right now, before you write another proposal or take another client call.

**The AI-Washing Reality Check:**

Ask yourself these brutal questions:

- Can you explain when to use RAG versus fine-tuning in plain English?
- Do you have specific opinions about embedding models and vector databases?
- Could you walk a client through the actual implementation steps for your proposed AI solution?
- Can you estimate realistic timelines for AI model training and deployment?

If you're hedging on any of these, you're not ready to sell AI consulting services. Full stop.

**The 30-Day Legitimate AI Consultant Action Plan:**

**Week 1: Domain Definition**

- List every area where you have genuine expertise (not surface knowledge)
- Pick the one domain where you have 5+ years of real experience
- Research how AI is currently being applied in that specific vertical
- Identify three specific AI use cases where you could add immediate value

**Week 2: Technical Foundation Building**

- Take a hands-on course in your chosen AI application area
- Build a small proof-of-concept project you can demonstrate
- Join relevant technical communities and start asking questions
- Document your learning process—this becomes content later

**Week 3: Network Mapping**

- List every consultant you know who complements your capabilities
- Identify specialists in adjacent areas you'll need for larger engagements
- Reach out to five potential partners with specific collaboration proposals
- Join industry groups where your target clients congregate

**Week 4: Content and Templates**

- Write one detailed case study about your proof-of-concept project
- Create a simple assessment framework clients can use to evaluate AI readiness
- Develop templates for three specific service offerings
- Publish your first piece of AI-specific content

**The Partnership Playbook:**

You need these relationships before you need them:

- **Technical Implementation Partner**: Someone who can build what you design
- **Data Engineering Specialist**: For clients with messy data infrastructure
- **Change Management Expert**: For organizations resistant to AI adoption
- **Industry Specialist**: Someone with deeper domain knowledge in adjacent verticals

Reach out now with specific value propositions. "I focus on AI strategy for healthcare operations. I'm looking for a technical partner who can handle implementation when my clients are ready to build. Here's a client scenario where I'd want to bring you in..."

**The Credibility Signal Checklist:**

Your content should demonstrate:

- Specific technical knowledge about AI tools and techniques
- Deep understanding of your chosen domain's unique challenges
- Real experience implementing AI solutions (even small ones)
- Honest assessment of what works and what doesn't
- Clear frameworks others can apply to their situations

**The Red Line Test:**

Before you take any AI consulting engagement, ask: "If this project fails, will it be because the client wasn't ready, ***or because I promised something I can't deliver?***"

If the answer is the latter, don't take the engagement. The short-term revenue isn't worth the long-term reputation damage.

Start building legitimacy today. The AI gold rush won't last forever, but the consultants who establish authentic expertise now will ride the wave for the next decade.

The fraudsters will flame out within 18 months. The professionals will build generational practices.

Which camp are you joining?

## **Bottom Line**

Get specific, get real, or get out. Yes, I’m being that blunt! I think hucksters are at risk of poisoning the AI consultant space with fake expertise.

Longterm, the $630 billion AI consulting market will reward authenticity and punish fraud—but only if we collectively raise the bar. Every AI-washed proposal that fails makes the next legitimate consultant's job harder. Every consultant who promises transformation and delivers Excel macros teaches enterprises that AI is snake oil.

You have a choice. You can join the army of fraudsters slapping "AI-powered" on existing services and hope nobody asks hard questions. You'll make money for 12-18 months before your reputation craters.

Or you can do the work. Pick your domain. Build real expertise. Create genuine partnerships. Develop frameworks that actually work. Put your knowledge out there for scrutiny.

The easy path leads to burnout. The hard path builds decade-long client relationships.

The AI revolution is real. The technology works. The demand is massive. But the window for establishing legitimate expertise is closing fast.

Choose wisely. The entire ecosystem is watching.

This is great advise, as always. I'm a psychotherapist but historically worked in marketing. I'm trying to figure a way into this world to consult others' in my space regarding AI. Keep up the good work Nate.
