- Federal authorities accuse Shenghua Wen, 41, of illegally exporting firearms, ammunition and other military items to North Korea.
- Authorities identified Wen as a Chinese national who settled in San Bernardino County after overstaying his student visa.
- Wen allegedly sent shipping containers bound for Hong Kong from Long Beach labeled as a refrigerator and camera parts.

Although Shenghua Wen entered the United States on a student visa, eventually settling in San Bernardino County, law enforcement officials say he had a more nefarious purpose: exporting shipments of firearms, ammunition and other military items to North Korea.

Federal authorities on Tuesday arrested Wen, 41, at his Ontario home, alleging he acted as an operative for the North Korean government, smuggling illicit goods concealed inside shipping containers from Long Beach.

Wen, who authorities said is a Chinese national living illegally in the U.S. after overstaying his visa, has been charged with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which deals with sanctions and frozen foreign assets. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.

Wen’s federal public defender did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It is illegal to supply North Korea with certain technologies and military supplies without U.S. government approval, according to U.S. Atty. Martin Estrada.

“North Korea engaged in a scheme to circumvent and evade those restrictions,” Estrada said at a news conference Tuesday morning. “It’s essential we keep sensitive materials, including military equipment, outside the hands of our adversaries where they can harm us or our allies.”

Wen, who arrived in the U.S. in 2012, was “key to this scheme and central to this plot” by North Korea, Estrada said.

Before leaving China, Wen met with North Korean officials at two consulates, where they allegedly directed him to procure goods in the U.S., according to a Nov. 26 criminal complaint.

In an interview with federal authorities, Wen said he was probably chosen for this role because he was good at smuggling, according to prosecutors.

Wen told authorities that while he was in the U.S., two North Koreans living in China, whom he identified as Jin Yong Nan and Cui, reached out to him. Wen kept in contact with Cui via an encrypted messaging platform, according to the complaint.

In his interview with federal authorities, Wen allegedly admitted he shipped two containers of firearms and other items to North Korea via Hong Kong in October and December 2023. One shipment was labeled as a refrigerator, another as camera parts, Estrada said. Wen allegedly received money for the containers and shipping fees — totaling at least $2 million — from North Korean officials.

To obtain the weapons, Wen paid $150,000 to buy Super Armory, a business with a federal firearms license that he later registered in Texas. Wen allegedly used the company and people known as straw purchasers to assemble shipments, according to the complaint. Authorities said he would then drive the guns and ammo from Texas to California.

Federal authorities said they also found emails and text messages from January to April, between Wen and a U.S.-based broker about obtaining a civilian airplane engine. During a September interview with authorities, Wen said North Korean officials told him to purchase plane engines, which would be used to help develop the North Korean military drone program, according to the complaint.

At Wen’s home on Aug. 14, law enforcement officials seized two devices that he allegedly intended to send to North Korea for military use: a chemical threat identification device and a handheld countersurveillance gadget that detects electronic eavesdropping, according to the complaint.

On Sept. 6, law enforcement seized about 50,000 rounds of 9-millimeter ammunition — stored in his white Ford van — that he’d allegedly obtained to send to North Korea, authorities said.

Wen told authorities he believed the North Korean government wanted the items he sent to prepare for an attack against South Korea, according to the complaint. Wen allegedly told authorities that the government wanted him to obtain military uniforms to be used by the North Korean military to disguise its soldiers during a surprise offensive.

Wen’s student visa was valid from Dec. 5, 2012, to Dec. 3, 2013, according to the complaint. Estrada said it’s unclear whether that was legitimate and whether he was actually studying.

Wen was ordered removed from the U.S. in 2018 and, after a 2021 arrest, he signed a form acknowledging his overstay status, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. It’s unclear how he was able to stay in the country.

Estrada said authorities learned about Wen through multiple tips, including from some individuals from whom he tried to purchase items.

“We can’t say how long he was operating this. The investigation continues,” Estrada said.
