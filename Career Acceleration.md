### Fighting AI fire with fire.

You know I think I’ve come around to understand the Monty Hall problem a little bit better. Basically, I have been working my butt off with the frustration of dealing with anonymous recruiters pestering me, but then a new set of them revealed that they were AI bots. So now that I know that, I bet my chances are better with the other two options.

- Door #1. A self-identified AI agent.
- Door #2. An actual company rep calling me about their rec.
- Door #3. One of several third party recruiters calling me for the same rec.

The last thing I want is an AI to talk to. Primarily because if you goof a question or stutter, you don’t get a second chance to correct yourself. That’s just stupid, especially taking the call before coffee. (rhetorically speaking. I actually only drink tea)

**Resume Cruncher**  
So I have taken **Nate B. Jones** to heart and started meta-prompting for real. My first project was to build an application around a prompt that takes a five step evaluation of a given job listing and then writes a custom resume appropriate for the position. It lets me know if I have a sufficient skillset and provides a graded match on a scale of 1 to 5.

Then it tells me about my project history relative to the likely projects the position will assign. This made me put together an exhaustive CV, more than I would ever submit to a website. This is particularly useful because I have done product marketing, business development, technical pre-sales, tech support and training in addition to my database design, team lead and delivery positions. The longer you do a varied career, the more difficult it is to sum it up in a short abstract. So I just give my AI everything and let it sort the thing out.

What’s great is that it gives me feedback about where I am overqualified, nearly there or a slam-dunk. So if (and when) I get ghosted by recruiters and submissions I do’t have to second-guess myself. Here’s a NO GO recommendation I got from the early version.

> \*\*From Step 4:\*\* Multiple deal-breakers:
> 
> \- No depth in pharmaceutical data sources (sales, patient, payer, claims)
> 
> \- No commercial pharma organization experience
> 
> \- Wrong functional specialty (architecture vs. acquisition)
> 
> \- Contract rate suggests mid-level role, not senior architect position
> 
> \*\*Why NO GO:\*\* This role is hunting for someone who has spent their career in pharmaceutical commercial analytics—someone who knows IQVIA, Symphony Health, Komodo, CMS data inside and out. Someone who has negotiated with pharmaceutical data vendors, understands longitudinal patient data, and has optimized data spend across commercial functions.
> 
> Your strengths lie in building data platforms, architecting scalable systems, and migrating complex infrastructures. This role wants someone who knows which pharmaceutical data to buy, from whom, at what price, and how commercial teams will use it.
> 
> This is not a skills gap you can bridge. This is a career path mismatch.
> 
> \*\*Contract Economics:\*\* At $75-77/hr for your experience level, pursuing a role outside your domain expertise makes no financial or strategic sense.

Now of course I know that my AI is second guessing the intent(s) of the hiring blob, but all we have to go on is the listing which may be AI generated itself. But that second opinion is one more than I ever had, considering the trustworthiness of first line interviewers who are doing placements.

Another recommendation I get is LOW BALL. I use that when I am obviously overqualified. If I get ghosted for those positions, it’s more than just me saying sour grapes.

But of course the biggest benefit is that I have my own machine shotgunning my credentials to specific gigs I wish to pursue. I may or may not automate it and have it crawling Dice, Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, The Ladders and Robert Half. It’s going to make me more productive and more confident. But I’m not going to publish any part of it until I am happily placed. Believe me, I don’t need the competition. You and I know this market sucks but damned if I’m going to get left out completely.

**Warning  
**It may be that AIs attract AIs. The downside is that I caught some scammers trying to set me up. You should know about the **ATS Resume Scam**. They say there is a short window and that I should pay $250 to give my resume that hand-built spit shine. That’s a load of crap. I figured it out when they were sending me emails at 11:30 pm and saying I only had 8-12 hours to beat the deadline. Yeah, right. For a job listing that’s 3 days old already? I only pay attention to actual telephone voices that tell me they’ve been placing people there.
