### Leadership in Europe today goes beyond the big three Western European countries - France, Germany and the UK. Poland is now an important power that cannot be ignored.

Hi Everyone,

I gave an [interview to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/world/europe/macron-starmer-merz-trump-eu.html) recently that would have been unremarkable otherwise, had they not so carefully omitted mentioning Poland – which I did talk about quite a bit. The article was about Germany, France and the UK coming together to figure out what to do about Trump and to prepare alternative solutions for Europe to be ready for the US to reduce its presence to a minimum. But discounting Poland from that equation simply misses the point of what has happened in Europe in the course of the past three years of Russia’s war in Ukraine: power becoming more diffusely, but in some ways also more fairly distributed. It is not enough anymore to get Western Europe together, Central and Eastern (and Northern) Europe have developed a much stronger voice of their own. In some ways this is still part of the process of healing from the Cold War division in Europe, and the war in Ukraine has accelerated it.

Yours,  
Minna

**The Long Process of European Unity**

The Cold War was not that long ago and its shadow has been long in Europe. It has been only 20 years since the EU (and NATO) integrated the Central and Eastern European countries in the early 2000’s. Within the EU, Germany and France were the dominant powers in the past decade after the UK’s decision to exit the EU, and [Western European economic interests dominated over Eastern Europe’s security interests](https://fiia.fi/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hsf-report-2024.pdf). The Nord Stream gas pipelines with Russia were perhaps the most obvious display of this dynamic. That the West knew better was the *Zeitgeist* when the East was being integrated into the (Western) European project. Not so anymore – that Western Europeans clearly got Russia wrong is indisputable. What was considered peripheral views and interests have become much more central now that Europe is beginning to imagine a new security order.

Not only has Central and Eastern Europe gained new recognition, but power has generally become distributed in a more diffuse way. Small states have stepped up to fill the vacuum that [France and Germany’s initial inability to offer credible leadership](https://fiia.fi/en/publication/franco-german-leadership-in-european-security) caused, [as I have described](https://phillipspobrien.substack.com/p/what-germanys-merz-mayhem-tells-about) previously. Some small states have gone to exceptional lengths, like [Denmark](https://phillipspobrien.substack.com/p/small-state-power-be-like-denmark). The [Nordic-Baltic 8](https://icds.ee/en/a-region-in-the-making-the-nordic-baltic-alignment/) have developed a strong voice of their own. And among the larger states, Poland and Italy have entered centre stage in Europe: in an unexpected turn of events, Giorgia Meloni’s government has been more stable than the [previous UK governments](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63383616). Poland has taken its place next to Germany and France and the [Weimar triangle](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/germany/the-weimar-triangle/) has gained new prominence. The Weimar+ format can flexibly include other aforementioned partners, recently particularly the UK.

That is truly new: that while it is necessary and welcome that the three big Western European countries – France, Germany and the UK – work more closely together again, it is not sufficient alone. Poland has now become much more part and parcel of that inner circle. And both Europe’s south and north demand to be represented more directly, not just through Germany and France. European unification and overcoming the Cold War division is not growing through amalgamation into one entity but through a multiplicity of voices.

Among the ten countries that joined the EU in the 2004 “ [big bang enlargement](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/eus-big-bang-enlargement-how-10-countries-transformed-the-eu/) ”, Poland and Estonia rank among some of the most impressive success stories. [Estonia has quadrupled both GDP per capita and average monthly salaries](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/10/01/defying-stereotypes-twenty-years-of-estonias-eu-membership/) since joining the EU and [Poland’s GDP per capita has increased by 40 percent](https://pie.net.pl/en/thanks-to-eu-membership-polands-gdp-per-capita-is-40-higher/), which is significantly higher than the 27 percentage average for the group of ten countries that joined at the same time (Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia). As share of GDP per capita, [Poland leads in NATO with the highest defence spending](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2025/4/pdf/sgar24-en.pdf#page=58) – higher than that of the US. Poland is also on course to become one of Europe’s largest military powers, aiming to [motivate every male citizen to get a basic military training](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-military-training-war-defense-russia-belarus/) in order to build a large reserve that can sustain a prologend defence effort. In addition[, Poland is mining its border with Russia](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/12/1250811327/poland-prepares-for-war), including also other defensive structures and obstacles. Poland is taking no chances of being invaded again, as has been its fate many times over in the past. Poland’s economic and military power are recognized now in ways that were far from self-evident as recently as three years ago.

Power distribution in Europe is shifting - for the better. It is not necessarily easier or faster to deal with many more players, but on the other hand various groups of (smaller) countries can take and drive initiative in lieu of larger powers, if domestic political instability or lack of fiscal space restrict the latter’s ability to lead. When more countries are contributing, the EU is less likely to become paralyzed by Franco-German inability to build consensus. It is certainly not making it any easier to answer Kissinger’s famous question about whom to call if he wants to call Europe - the EU Commission, for example, is one actor among many. There will never be a single European leader; leadership only exists in plural. A more evenly and, perhaps even to an extent fairly shared leadership is needed when the continent is taking charge of its security. Europe needs good ideas and bold initiatives, no matter from which geographical location and size of economy they come from.

P.S. In today’s good news: already by April, [Europe had filled the gap left by no new US aid to Ukraine](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/ukraine-support-europe-largely-fills-the-us-aid-withdrawal-lead-byn-the-nordics-and-the-uk/) this year. The effort has mainly been led by the Nordics and the UK (and the EU institutions), with other Europeans allocating significantly less aid. Given that it has been the four small Nordic countries who have filled the support gap, it is yet more proof that one should never underestimate the small ones!
