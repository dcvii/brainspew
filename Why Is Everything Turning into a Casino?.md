### I share seven rules of casino management—see how many apply now to legit businesses

What a bummer of a day for ESPN.

The network needed to cover the FBI’s [arrest of a NBA head coach and two players](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/23/nyregion/nba-illegal-gambling-arrests) in a betting scandal. These pro athletes allegedly scammed gamblers—and worked in cahoots with the Bonanno, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese families.

In case you don’t watch Mafia movies, I’ll inform you that these are four of the [five organized crime families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Families) running New York operations for decades. The Gioia clan has personal experience (of the worst kind) with these bad boys—my dad told tales about visiting [Joe Bonanno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bonanno) ’s home with his father as a youngster.[^1]

Let me make this absolutely clear: You avoid tangling with these wiseguys at all costs—and you *never* get into business with them.

But the embarrassing part of the story happened while ESPN’s hosts covered this gambling scandal with much hand-wringing and moralizing. At the *very same moment*, in the bottom corner of the screen, ESPN displayed an ad for its own betting business.

A caption promises in all capital letters: **BET $10 GET $100.**

So let me spell it out for you: ESPN is now in the same business those five Mafia crime families once controlled. They constantly badger their audience into taking bets. But they are *shocked* when pro athletes get caught up in a gambling scandal.

It was like that moment in *Casablanca*, where the police captain shuts down the gambling operation—but needs to collect his winnings first.

But you can’t blame ESPN—or not much—because everybody is getting into the gambling business.

The NBA itself is part of this mess. [The league aggressively lobbied for the removal of legal restrictions on sports betting](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6745307/2025/10/23/nba-gambling-betting-timeline-adam-silver/), and now has several partnerships with gambling businesses.

It’s not just sports. Two weeks before the FBI arrests, the New York Stock Exchange [invested $2 billion in the Polymarket betting operation](https://www.reuters.com/business/nyse-parent-nears-deal-2-billion-stake-polymarket-wsj-reports-2025-10-07/). As Gordan Gekko says in the movie *Wall Street*: “It’s all about bucks, kid.”

Does the NYSE now count as the sixth family running gambling in New York?

> ### “Among the 8 largest companies in the world, at least half of them promote addiction with screen interfaces that mimic slot machines.”

No, it’s not that simple. There are lots of gambling businesses in New York, starting with the government. The NY State Lottery brings in more cash than all the Mafia families combined. So the NYSE is a johnny-come-lately to the gaming tables, like country rubes visiting the Statue of Liberty.

Of course, the real insidious process is happening online, where every big web platform is imitating a gambling casino. And they rake in gangsta profits bigger than any gangsta has ever made.

How bad is it? Consider this fact: Among the eight largest companies in the world, at least half of them promote addiction with screen interfaces that mimic slot machines.

This is where I need to tell you about Bill Friedman, a former gambling addict who wrote a very influential ([and expensive](https://www.gamblersgeneralstore.com/store/p/4858-DESIGNING-CASINOS-TO-DOMINATE-THE-COMPETITION.aspx)) book on casino design. He must sell lots of copies in Silicon Valley, because his gambling concepts are now sacred rules in building web platforms.

![book cover](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JAyQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6cc7949-25b4-4eb4-a9b9-16e4a411bf09_1152x980.png)

This book explains web platforms better than any tech manual

This is where the real action takes place, my friends. So let me share seven secret rules of casino design—and see if you can notice the Las Vegas-Silicon Valley connection.

#### 1\. A casino must be easy to enter—and present an initial appearance of openness. But it’s hard to leave.

It’s like [my Threads account](https://www.threads.com/@tedgioia), which was easy-peasy to create. But I can’t delete it without eliminating my entire Facebook presence. The same is true of Facebook Messenger—I can’t opt out without deleting everything. And even if I take that extreme move, [Meta continues to track people after they leave](https://digiday.com/media/why-facebook-keeps-collecting-peoples-data-and-building-their-profiles-even-when-their-accounts-are-deactivated/) —because, hey, selling your data is their grift.

Joe Bonanno ran his numbers game. And Mark Zuckerberg runs a different kind of numbers game. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

#### 2\. The casino is designed so that people get lost—locking them inside all the more securely.

This strategy is called the [Gruen Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruen_transfer) —named after Austrian architect Victor Gruen. You deliberately create confusion among customers, so they lose their sense of direction and purpose.

This makes them susceptible to impulse buying, and other forms of manipulation.

That’s why shopping malls have such large, complex layouts with distractions and interruptions built into the buyer experience. And it’s why supermarkets put essential items like milk and meat in the farthest reaches of the store.

Las Vegas casinos took this concept to the next level. [According to CasinosUSA.com](https://www.casinousa.com/blog/psychology-of-casino-design):

> Friedman proposed that a confusing and maze-like layout would force guests to wander around.
> 
> So, for example, the playing floor does not have straight aisles leading to exits or clear pathways between sections.
> 
> This increases the players’ chances of seeing more machines, tables, restaurants, or bars where they would spend more money. This kind of layout also uses low ceilings and narrow pathways.

So the next time you get lost while navigating through a web platform, remind yourself that this may be intentional. After they capture you—with an open entry point—they keep you in a maze. Your confusion increases their profitability.

#### 3\. Inside the casino, you lose track of time—you don’t see clocks or even windows. So you can’t tell if it’s day or night.

When people lose contact with the outside world, they become more vulnerable. That’s why cults always try to get newcomers to attend their getaway retreat—leaving home and other connections behind.

Las Vegas runs on the same strategy. It creates its own isolated world—complete with everything from a [fake Egyptian pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor_Las_Vegas) to a [half-size Eiffel Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Las_Vegas). But the gaming rooms are the most isolating of all. They create the illusion that nothing exists except round-the-clock gambling.

In the tech world, smartphones, apps, and earbuds aim for the same effect. People scroll and swipe for hours, losing all sense of external reality. The social cost is enormous, but a few ~~crime families~~ tech leaders get fabulously wealthy.

#### 4\. Casinos grab your attention with constantly changing lights, sounds, and colors—creating non-stop stimuli that keep you hooked.

TikTok’s colors are similar to those you find on a roulette table. Even the [trademark TikTok melodic motif](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wkuN3cVYeFA) at the end of a video is reminiscent of a [slot machine’s spinning wheels sound effect](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cOvNaaqJJIk).

Do you think this is coincidence?

Is there anything on planet Earth with more varied light and color stimuli than the endless scroll on a smartphone app? Not even a slot machine can match it.

You might say that Silicon Valley has invented the ultimate slot machine—and somehow convinces people to carry it with them wherever they go.

#### 5\. Casinos want you to start gambling immediately. So the first thing you see is slot machines.

The first thing I see when I open a social media app is typically links to scrolling media—they’re

often at the top of the screen. If I start scrolling, the interface shifts to an all-video feed.

This is straight from the casino playbook. Get people spinning the wheel as soon as possible—so put it up front and center.

#### 6\. Create fake intimacy so people let down their guard.

In Las Vegas, casino paths lead off to smaller islands or rooms where you feel separated from the hubbub. Friedman advised casinos to install lower ceilings here to create even more of a home-like sense of intimacy. Adding to the effect, the staff and servers treat gamblers with a fake friendliness that further disarms them.

But social media does an even better job of conveying phony intimacy. The platforms actually get your family and friends to sign up to—so the line blurs between real connections and fake ones. One moment you’re interacting with your granny, and the next your caught up in the endless scroll.

#### 7\. Once you sit down at the slot machine, all you see is the screen. Everything else is out of sight.

Over time, slot machines have gotten bigger and bigger. Some are now eight or nine feet tall. There’s a reason for that—the casinos don’t want you to see anything else.

Over time, my smartphone screen has gotten bigger and bigger. Hmmm, I wonder why.

---

Of course, none of this demands your participation. You can leave the casino at any moment—or never enter in the first place. Even if gambling is addictive, most people refuse the bait.

That’s especially true right now. Las Vegas tourism has fallen dramatically. And when you interview consumers, they will tell you why—they are upset at the casinos. The gambling business has become too exploitative and manipulative.

So people just walk away.

The [exact same thing is starting to happen with social media](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/social-media-is-now-shrinking). And for the same reason—folks are fed up with the apps. Many stop using them, and brag about it to their friends. So the trend of walking away feeds on itself.

By the way, the same thing is happening in sports betting. The public is turning against it.

A few days ago, [Pew Research released the results of a survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/02/americans-increasingly-see-legal-sports-betting-as-a-bad-thing-for-society-and-sports/) which shows a significant increase in public hostility to legal sports gambling.

According to Pew:

> Today, 43% of U.S. adults say the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the country is a bad thing for society. That’s up from 34% in 2022. And 40% of adults now say it’s a bad thing for sports, up from 33%.

I note that this survey took place before the FBI arrests this week. This high profile case is likely to turn even more people against the mainstreaming of gambling.

Maybe businesses need to find a different role model than a casino. It’s not hard to think of a few examples.

So let me close with a wild idea.

Perhaps they can design web apps to *serve people* —instead of controlling, manipulating, and surveilling them. After all, many businesses once thrived with that simple formula. It’s not too late to return to that practice.

[^1]: I’m pretty sure my grandpa had no choice in this matter. He hated the Mafia with a passion—it put his father in prison back in Sicily and forced him to flee to America. Even today, I can show you wedding photos where my grandpa keeps as much distance from the Mafia guests as possible. He couldn’t fight these people, so his strategy was avoidance at all costs. So I’m sure his visit to the Bonanno residence was a matter of utmost necessity, or even self preservation.
