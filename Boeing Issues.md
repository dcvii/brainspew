How is Boeing building the world's most powerful deep-space rocket?

Boeing are using the traditional methods developed last century in order to replicate 1980s technology that doesn’t even match 1960s efforts.

Let’s break down what they’re actually doing so that you can get an idea what the issues are. Starting with the engines, Boeing are using old RS25 Space Shuttle main engines that run on hydrogen and oxygen. These are literally old engines from the Shuttle program, but have been modified to increase the thrust at the price of only being single use, no longer reusable like they were on the Shuttle. The main tank walls are huge slabs of aluminum alloy that have been milled out on a giant milling machine table (leaving only a fraction of the original material behind), then bent into curves before being friction stir welded with other tank sections in an incredibly time intensive and expensive operation.

After assembly of this giant 8.4m diameter tank, it is mated with four second-hand RS-25 SSMEs, and uses an up-rated version of the same Space Shuttle SRBs (solid rocket boosters). These are very similar to the Space Shuttles, but are more powerful, have an extra segment added, but are not recovered and refurbished like the Space Shuttle’s SRBs were. Everything is expendable on the SLS apart from the payload, which ultimately will be the Orion capsule.

All this effort produces a vehicle that can generate a take off thrust of 36.6 MN and launch 95 tonnes to LEO for the block 1 version, rising to 130 tonnes on the block 2 variant.

In comparison, the 1960s-derived Saturn V delivered a take off thrust of 35.1 MN, lifting 140 tonnes to LEO.

The vehicle that supplies much of the inspiration for the SLS, the Space Shuttle, had 30.3 MN of take-off thrust and was capable of delivering a payload of 27.5 tonnes to LEO, but this doesn’t include the weight of the orbiter itself, which massed at an impressive 110 tonnes at launch. This brings up the total mass that was capable of achieving LEO at 137.5 tonnes.

Now this seems to be sort of ballpark in the thrust and payload figures, but bear in mind that the comparisons here are 40 and 60 years old — what about something a little more contemporary?

Consider the SpaceX Starship currently in development right now. Despite the fact that it only really started serious development in the last two years, compared to the SLS’s 9 years, it looks like a real race to see which system will attain orbit first. The Starship uses revolutionary engines that are full flow, staged combustion, and are the first of their type to ever fly. These Raptor engines are all that’s required for full service, and no wasteful SRBs are required. The 9m diameter hull is fabricated from simple stainless steel for a tiny fraction of the cost of the SLS’s hull, and the construction techniques and materials have already been proven in flight.

No part of the Starship is thrown away, with everything being fully and rapidly re-usable. This alone makes for incredible savings over and above a vehicle that is totally expendable like the SLS. The Starship will have around 56 to 72 MN of take off thrust depending on booster configuration, and will start with a 100 tonne payload to LEO for first derivatives. 100 tonnes may not seem like much compared to a Saturn V, but consider that a Starship will be able to do something that no other vehicle has ever been capable of contemplating, and that’s taking this LEO mass outside the Earth’s sphere of influence thanks to orbital refueling.

This means 100 tonnes delivered to the moon or Mars, with a vehicle that’s capable of making a return to Earth. Instead of a launch cost of somewhere between $1 to $2 billion dollars, a Starship will cost around $2 million to launch, and will carry a far greater payload than any other system, no matter how powerful it may be.
