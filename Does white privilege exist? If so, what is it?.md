[What exactly is ‘white privilege’?](https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-is-%E2%80%98white-privilege%E2%80%99?no_redirect=1)

This question previously had details. They are now in a comment.

White privilege is an internet meme dressed up in academic robes.

It is a theory that attempts to explain social differences in middle class Americans as a function of race. Find an expert on white privilege and have them explain the difference between race and culture. They can’t, because they really just mean race. And so it is a conspiracy theory that insists that so-called white folks from Delaware are the same as whites from South Dakota are the same as whites from Texas are the same as whites from Ohio and New Hampshire and they all work a system of white supremacy like Jim Crow in Alabama to suppress and dishonor people who are not white like them. Just enough not to be against the law, but enough to harm and burden the lives of everybody else.

The inventor of the term, Peggy McIntosh, regrets how it has been abused to try to explain everything in society. But you know people and their racial theories. Multiculturalists and other sorts of activists of identity politics have pounced on this particular form of political correctness in order to politicize for the sake of their ideology the most mundane aspects of bourgeois life.

It’s a race hustle. The proper thing to do is mock it into oblivion.

It simply refers to the rather obvious observation that whites and non-whites are not treated equally, at least within the same socioeconomic group. It has been documented by so many studies that it requires no citation.[Venkata Kottapalli](https://www.quora.com/profile/Venkata-Kottapalli)

Possibly. But I think people understand what the term means. My post was intended to be a rebuttal to the answer to which it was posted, which I interpreted to mean that the concept of structural racial inequality was a myth perpetuated by those on the left of the political spectrum. It, along with global warming and evolutions are three “theories” derided by the reactionaries but accepted as givens by almost every credible expert and study,[Henry Resheto](https://www.quora.com/profile/Henry-Resheto)

The myth is not about structural inequality, the myth is about structural discrimination. Yes, it is part of left wing mythology among other myths.

This is true statistically. For individuals, it's a gross oversimplification that isn't helpful.

But I, an elderly white woman, experience white privilege when I drive my car, and get pulled over for an error or an equipment fault, and the cops are helpful and don’t give me a ticket. When I’m riding with black people, I see the harsh contrast in the way cops treat them. Surely what I experience, totally without deserving it, is simply privilege of a kind that is reserved for white people—white privilege.[Percy Murphy Taggerts](https://www.quora.com/profile/Percy-Murphy-Taggerts)

It isn’t so much “White Privilege” as it is a “Minority Tax”.

I don’t want special treatment because I am Black, But I also sure as hell want to be seen as a well meaning, contributing member of society at first glance, and not a “thug” or miscreant based on my skin color. Unfortunately, “studies” and “statistics” may be skewed and viewed in any way an observer wishes.

The book “Black Like Me” by John Howard Griffin should be enough proof to justify that we still have a race issue in the United States. Mocking it and saying it doesn’t exist just adds more fuel to a fire that does not need to be stoked.

Realistically, it is not that I am more privileged than a poor White person with no college education and poor chances for upward mobility. It is that I am statistically more likely to get a ticket for minor offenses and more likely to be a victim of police brutality based on those offenses. It is that I am more likely to get my job application tossed simply because my name and not the amount of experience or references I have brought to the table.

The minority tax has not hit me as hard personally as some other people of color, but it is still disheartening that people see my color before they see the content of my character and my intelligence.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

Black Like Me was written 56 years ago when computers were as big as houses and less powerful than my Fitbit.

Every time I see an answer like this it makes me sad, because it represents to me such a complete capitulation to despair. It’s like some kid watching pickup basketball in Utah and thinking he knows the whole game. Then when LeBron James tells them it’s not like that all they can say is, well, statistically in Utah that’s what it is, and for 100 year in Utah that’s how it has been, so basketball has got a long way to go…

I think more people need to listen to the music of the 50s. Maybe then they’ll figure out the attitude of winning. It sure ain’t what’s winning Grammys today.[Angel Santiago](https://www.quora.com/profile/Angel-Santiago-8)

Mr. Bowen, I’m not in despair, if thats what you read in my comment.

I have a good job, I am in college, and overall I am content with my life.

But there are certain problems that must be addressed as a part of normal human discussion to advance ourselves as a species. Just because “Black Like Me” was written 50 years ago does not disqualify the fact that colored people still face prejudices that John Howard Griffin faced when he was Black, not White.

I’m not “a kid on the sidelines who thinks he’s got the whole game figured out”. Interestingly enough, I am a kid who was hoping to understand more of your view point through tactful discussion, not name calling.

If you wish to address some of the points I made in my comment in a more respectful and diplomatic way, I am all ears to see where you are coming from in your opinion of White Privilege.

If not, I hope that you at least have taken what I have written here into some consideration to help yourself come to a more informed conclusion as to what you believe, just as I have with your answer. Without discussions, there is no progress.

So like Morpheus, what if I told you that if you managed to earn $75,000 a year, all of that discrimination and talk about 50 year old books will disappear from your life. Right here in America, today?

What if I told you that you could spend about 50 hours a year thinking about ‘minority issues’? Would you completely walk away from them, or would you volunteer to stand in solidarity with what the daily news tells you are the oppressed people of color?

I want you to seriously ask yourself whether or not you are programmed to think about race, and how much time it occupies your mind. Time that is limited, that you could spend on anything else in the entire scope of human accomplishment. In other words, I’m asking you to take a mental trip to Atlantis, to the paradise where nobody gives race a second thought. And then you come back to America and everybody’s talking about it. How much time will you occupy your life with that talk? How much of their ‘problems’ and ‘solutions’ will you learn?

I’ve already had the 20 years and 5000 polite and respectful conversations. Waste of time for me now. But I actually got some good writing done. You can read a lot of it. Here’s the one I’m thinking about today…

I read your post, and found your angles very interesting.

You don’t have an option to recieve messages on your profile and I would want to talk about what you wrote more privately. I like learning, and reading about what you lived through just intrigued me so deeply that I would want to hear about it more from your perspective, if you would, preferably over email or Quora messages.

Thanks again.

A term being misused doesn’t invalidate the theory behind the term itself. Even “meme” (I believe) was coined by Richard Dawkins in the Selfish Gene, and it meant something similar, though less to do with the internet specifically and more to do with anything (a popular idea, for instance) that in a given culture or group can “replicate”. In a non-genetic way that mimics genetics. It's been sort of misused or co-opted by people on social media sharing silly pictures and 3-second videos. That doesn't mean the term itself is invalid, because some people use it in a derivative way.

White privilege as a concept is super valid. It's true that in the US and elsewhere white people broadly are treated better than racialized minorities, especially black people. Whites aren't dragged out of their cars and shot in the brain for a broken taillight. If the term is used too liberally, too bad; your annoyance with social justice warriors doesn't change how true it is that white people experience privileges black people simply don't, literally only because of their skin color.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

White privilege as a theory doesn’t pass scientific analysis. The very proof is in the ridiculous emphasis on the miniscule numbers of black Americans who are shot by police. 400 out of 40 million. There is no logical way to defend a theory based on that smattering of evidence, and you will note that there are no econometrics. One may as well believe in Spiderman. At least you can see how much money the movies make, that being factually documented.

Police shootings of black men are only one symptom of the broader issue. You can also look at black poverty across the board, incarceration rates, or any number of horrible statistics (which you'll agree have nothing to do with being black itself and everything to do with the opportunities or lack thereof that certain racialized groups are afforded by those in power). That's where white privilege comes from.

Like — I'm not black, obviously. I don't live in the US. But I experience white privilege: You hear stories even in Canada of Indigenous people getting followed by security guards at malls, of whites refusing medical care from non-white doctors — or of Sikh politicians getting verbally attacked at talks because they’re brown and wearing a turban (that was the Jagmeet Singh incident). Or of Muslims getting slaughtered at mosque.

The very fact that whites aren't targeted in these ways means we’re privileged. Solely because of race. Sorry, I don't like it either; but that's how it is. I'm not going to be massacred any time soon because of my skin color, or followed at a mall, or shot for a broken taillight. That means I'm privileged, I experience white privilege.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

You can make up your mind to look at black folks through the lens of ‘broader issues’ like poverty, incarceration rates and other ‘horrible statistics’, but that is a very narrow and specific political view. I don’t hear stories of Indigenous people getting followed by security guards at malls, because I don’t listen for them. It’s hearsay and it’s unscientific and it is beneath the radar of the interest of law. In other words it’s legal, private behavior that so far we have decided not to police.

Now if people of your political persuasion wish to begin policing this behavior based upon your racial theory of ‘white privilege’, you’re going to face an uphill battle. Or who knows, maybe you can convince people to go along with your racial standards. But they have nothing to do with justice and you’re fooling yourself if you think they do.

There’s a misrepresentation of my argument here, maybe purposefully on your part. What I’m definitely not saying is that I expect individual racists doing everyday racist things like tailing PoC at malls to be found out and arrested - mainly because that would be really hard to do, but also because that’s not how you fight racism. It’s a structural issue so you fight it structurally: through education, at every level, through communities, whatever.

Also I see you trying to turn my argument around into me looking at racialized groups through a lens of negativity. Which is not at all what I’m doing. I bring up incarceration rates and poverty and police shootings because they are evidence of white privilege. That’s it, that’s all. That’s what I’m arguing - that that privilege exists. In order to do so I have to point out the systemic oppression black people face, that white people largely do not. That has everything to do with justice.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

So how much of your money will you spend, on an annual basis to get rid of your white shame?

I’m not ashamed to be white. I’m ashamed of what white people have done to PoC and what we’re still doing - every time a black kid gets shot for walking down the street my stomach lurches and I want to hop the border and run up to Congress and start punching the shit out of all those racist old idiots.

What good will my money do? I don’t have any. I’m poor as crap. But I’ll continue to write about how white people ought to be cognizant of systemic racism and what we can do to avoid turning into a cop who sees a kid in a hoodie and assumes he’s a criminal who needs to be put down.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

Exactly. You have words of encouragement and sentiment, but not money. That is precisely the limit of race relations and exactly why the difference between acknowledging white privilege as something concrete and just another bourgeois self-congratulatory trendy talking point is negligible. Your skin in the game is words. Not much of an investment. Except that you’re not actually dismantling white identity. In fact, you are saying that white is what it is and whites have a special and unique duty owing to their race that only whites can accomplish.

If you could solve racism with money, it would mean your white identity is meaningless, because the money could come from anywhere.

White man’s burden. Nothing different in that than from colonialism. It’s a simple enough lesson to learn. So why continue with the racial theories? Walk away. Just walk away.

Okay, so you feel it’s like a savior complex, talking about white privilege - like an obfuscation of what lies beneath, which is the struggle of black people. I understand that and I see how it would come off like that. But I think, because America’s white people have specifically been oppressing PoC for 300-ish years, that it sort of does concern white people. At the very least there’s a responsibility to own up to there. Part of white privilege is actually that very thing, not being forced to recognize what we’ve done in the past and how awful it was and how that exploitation helped us maintain our self-appointed societal status.

If it seems like people like me are jumping on this to make ourselves look like white saviors - I don’t know what to say, some people probably are trying to do that, I’m not going to pretend they aren’t. For me it’s just I wake up and I see black kids getting shot by police officers and I think to myself, “Well, that makes me want to throw up”, and then I think, “Okay, what can I do? How can I help make that not happen”? My method is to write about it and speak to the people I love who might hold racial biases, like my really racist grandmother. I feel like I have an obligation to tackle racism in my own family and among my own friends, because it certainly exists. Because who’s a racist old white woman going to listen to, some black kid (who she probably thinks might be a criminal), or me, her white grandkid? It’s shit but that’s how she works, and I might as well jump on my opportunity.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

The bottom line is that you feel you have an obligation to say something different depending on the race of the person you’re talking to, because you believe that each race carries its own unique social responsibility.

To an extent it’s true, we do: white people have a history of oppression through colonization and slavery that black people just literally don’t share. And ethnic groups have been treated differently, uniquely, in a social sense for hundreds of years - actually since the beginning of civilization. Like, this stuff doesn’t come up in conversation regularly - it only does when someone’s being actively racist and I am in a position to do something about it. In those situations I refuse to be complicit.

What I want to do is help make sure people who share my skin color don’t use their racial privilege to further oppress - and part of further oppression is inaction, or complicity. In order to do so I have to talk about white privilege and the unequal footing different ethnic groups have in society. By any other name, white privilege is just “you are treated different in society and have access to different opportunities because of your race”. In this case it applies to white people, in a “positive” sense. That’s all it is.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

I don’t think you understand how much you underscore the value and the meaning of race as you promulgate such talk ‘through education, at every level, through communities’. You really evidence a marked inability to view history through anything but a racial lens, and your propaganda expands that disability over time. Of course it’s not you, it was done to you and you can’t see that. Take it from somebody who was born a Negro, grew up black, and now doesn’t give racial thought the time of day. You are projecting whiteness back through history. That’s a fail.

I'm talking about race because that's the subject we’re discussing. Want me to talk about history through a different lens? We could do religion — we could talk about the history of Christianity, or Judaism or Islam, how they affected the cultures and societies that adopted them, how they still do — what they have in common, what the differences are. How religion has changed since its earliest inceptions in prehistory and how it's still changing.

We can talk about history from a feminist perspective. We can discuss how women — of all skin colors — have been oppressed throughout the history of civilization and how they still are. We can discuss patriarchy and the rare examples of matriarchy that occasionally showed themselves in the course of human existence.

We could look at history from an economic perspective, discussing how capitalism has shaped modern societies, what the alternatives were and are.

I'm viewing history through the lens of race because we are talking about race. There are a million and one ways to look at history and most of those ways are deeply intertwined with each other.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

So we have this concept of white privilege which are social advantages in America that do not rise to the level of crime. But you are comfortable asserting that it is of the exact same racism that you associate with a history that harkens back to hundreds of years of slavery and colonialism. Right? You’re saying the same white in you is the same white as in King Leopold of Belgium, right?

Or is white privilege just some contemporary idea within the bourgeois middle class of the US and Canada? Because if white privilege is not a necessary logical extension of the exact same racial theory that justifies slavery and genocide, then exactly who should care?

Either the white is the same racial white, with the same intrinsic message of inevitable racial superiority or it is not. Are you claiming that very permanent and unchanging racial whiteness or not?

So lets be very specific. I give the the example of a hate crime as defined by the FBI and the law of the US. It is a crime in which racial animus is the proximate cause of the crime. This has to be proven in a court of law. Without such proof you are defying causality. It’s the difference between ‘happen to be’ and ‘because he is’. I hope you are unambiguously clear about this.

I am saying that ‘white privilege’ is not worth talking about unless everything it describes denotes that same standard of racial animus as proximate cause. Even if you want to deflect to ‘institutions’ it must come down to racial animus as proximate cause, the number one factor, the raison d’etre, the unavoidable unquestionable undisputed reason.

If that is the white privilege we are talking about then everything said about white privilege in contemporary America can be said to be exactly the same case as in Nazi Germany, or Nationalist South Africa. The only difference being the matter of law. So if white privilege in America embodies the spirit of Apartheid Law, simply without the letter of that law, then we have something worth talking about.

Otherwise, as I said, it is merely a loose interpretation of what so-called white people sorta kinda think they sorta kinda believe about themselves… but not enough to actually spend money on.

I reiterate that I believe it to be the latter, which when sloppily applied to the history of the world as the proximate reason for slavery, murder and other great injustices and crimes against humanity, can be sustained as something for which new generations actually seek to imbue new, real and ultimately legal weigh to. In other words 1,000 Nazis in any so-called white society can and will inevitably call upon people who believe they are white to defend themselves as white people. Why? Because so-called white people actually believe that what they know and what they do is unique to their race and it’s all about race. So any and everything done to keep that idea of white identity alive will inevitably revert to the manner and spirit and ultimately law of King Leopold.

So you have a difficult task, which is actually simple. Deny that you are white, and that what is said about white people, race, culture and white anything, including white privilege applies to you. I want to take this opportunity to force you into making that decision.

Whiteness itself is not the cause of anything, if it existed in a void. Neither is blackness. They’re just respective combinations of genes that exist in any given human being. I’m neither proud nor ashamed of my random combination of genes; it just literally is what it is. I’m literally not the “same white” as any distant historical figure because we share a different genetic makeup, like every individual on the planet. But it doesn’t really matter, because white is perceived as white, and black as black - people have those perceptions. What matters is recognizing how that feature in myself and in others, black or white or whatever, makes us be treated. We should absolutely eventually do away with notions of race, period. Because they really shouldn’t matter. But people force them to matter. You think I’m forcing them to matter. What I’m trying to do is recognize a problem, and to address it, I can’t pretend the IDEA of race doesn’t exist, and that people don’t rally behind it - because it does, and they do.

So you believe, if I read it right, that this idea of whiteness and blackness gives racially-motivated groups like Nazis fuel to mobilize themselves? “In other words 1,000 Nazis in any so-called white society can and will inevitably call upon people who believe they are white to defend themselves as white people.” - I agree with that because that’s literally happening as we speak.

But please - you have to find the difference between actual Nazis who buy into the idea of race to promote their bigotry and activists who buy into it - from a sociological/psychological standpoint - to try and dismantle it. Unfortunately you can’t work to dismantle something if you never speak about it, or recognize it exists.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

Let’s simplify it for a moment, because I’m saying specifically that the concept of ‘white privilege’ racializes in the very terms Nazis and other racists want, millions of Americans who otherwise might not think of themselves as ‘white’. Those are, specifically, the millenials SJWs who are learning wrongheaded concepts about privilege in colleges today.

Even if you used the term ‘European privilege’ it would be a more properly worded concept, for the same reason ‘African American’, problematic as it is, is superior to ‘black’.

So let me be explicit. Imagine I’m a black radical nationalist from BLM, and I address a crowd. Here’s my speech>

“Yeah you can call yourself Italian American, Jewish, Armenian, English, German, Scots-Irish, Irish, Scottish, whatever. You all participate in white privilege, and none of that other stuff matters. You’re all one race, the white race. “

Again from a different direction from Nazis, but the white in white privilege sets you into that racial bucket. The more people accept the identity of white in ‘white privilege’, the more they enable racists.

The sociological/psychological standpoint is erased by the racial term. The more you look at the questions here and in the press, the more you will recognize the validation of the racial over the cultural, or the racial as identical to the cultural. The more you look at surveys the more you will see the racial even over the educational and economic. You can’t even say ‘Southern’ without the connotation of ‘racist whites’.

So eventually you have to ask yourself why anybody would use the term ‘white privilege’ who has broad associations. Which is to beg the question of how citizens approach strangers. Should one who is nominally white ‘check their privilege’ in every conversation with someone who is not? Why should you even allow the idea of the term give you a reason to add a new layer of questions into your interpersonal relations? That’s rhetorical. The answer is ‘because I’m white’. But you could be Buddhist Scots-Irish and not be white or let concepts as dicey as ‘white privilege’ guide or interfere with your relationships with other human beings. Ahh but you have to because that’s what ‘society’ dictates? It’s what’s expected from you as a white person?

Again. Any set of prescriptions to fight racism that have different roles for different races is bound to fail AND re-inscribe racial theories in a new way.

Here’s something. Note how Bret Weinstein got attacked by nominally white students. The American Nazis aren’t the real problem.

If you feel I and people like me are going about it the wrong way, say so in a constructive way we can build on. But square one is agreeing that privilege exists, in my (very strong) opinion. Race can be a fabrication and still hold real-world consequences, as it does.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

It’s evident to me that it’s no sort of conspiracy theory at all. But I clearly can’t change your mind, and you clearly can’t change mine, so maybe it’s time to leave this where it is. Not going to lie, linking that Joe Rogan video really didn’t help, especially since Jordan Peterson apparently has something to do with it and he’s someone that I and people in my community have specifically protested and spoken out against for the last few years.

I never heard a compelling argument to convince me why white privilege doesn’t exist and why I shouldn’t talk about it. As with anything I’m willing to evolve my opinion on it but I need something solid to go on and I didn’t find that here.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

You cite higher incarceration rates as evidence of systemic oppression, which is itself tantamount to white privilege. Sip me if I’m wrong.

If I’m right, I would say that your evidence is flimsy at best. Higher incarceration rates for minorities indicate suggest that, statistically speaking, those minorities commit and are convicted of more crimes in which incarceration is the punishment. The higher rate is an observation of what you say the effects of white privilege are, they are not evidence of that privilege by themselves though.[Michael Bennes](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Bennes)

I agree that “white privilege” doesn’t explain all of our social ills. There are plenty of non-privileged white people. But it does exists.

Although I’m technically white (I’m from Spain), I’m also considered Hispanic, and this anecdote is very telling.

I started working as a teacher assistant many years ago. The teacher I worked with was white and she also had a white student teacher in the classroom. One day, she asked me to translate some text into Spanish (a lot of her students’ parents were Spanish speakers) so she handed me the text and a yellow legal notebook for me to write the translation. So I did. Immediately after she took the translated text and gave it to the white student teacher so she could type it in the computer. She didn’t even bother asking me if I could use a computer, she just assumed I couldn’t because….? I wasn’t white enough? I spoke Spanish therefore I couldn’t use a computer/type? I don’t know. I let her know that next time I could just type the text into the computer and save an unnecessary step.

This is just an example. I also usually ask my very white husband to handle some situations like reservations, appointments, and other needs that require customer service because he gets better treatment and is taken more seriously than me. So please don’t tell me it doesn’t happen. It happens all the time.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

Yes that’s very nice anecdotal story, but it doesn’t concern me because it doesn’t rise to the level of the public interest. The public interest is defined by law. So long as you are not ready to create a police state where people can’t insult you because they think you don’t use a computer, then it’s none of my business and none of anybody’s business. It’s just a sad story not an injustice. You can go and tell your priest, not your Congressman.[Elena Gossin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Elena-Gossin)

The question was

What exactly is ‘white privilege’?

I’m not a scholar but I think that white privilege is the assumption that white people are better or more deserving of better treatment just because they’re white. What I wrote was, just like I said, only an anecdote, but I think it illustrated pretty well what white privilege is. My husband is white so I have plenty of other “anecdotes” to compare the way I was treated or perceived versus his own experiences. It has happened enough times that now I ask him to handle certain things knowing it will move faster and better if he does it. I don’t think there is any way to regulate these kinds of attitudes by law, discrimination based on stereotypes is almost human nature. And don’t worry, I’m not scarred for life because some people don’t see past my looks or my accent.

I don’t have a priest since I’m not a religious person, that’s why I write about these things here.[Theodore Fifer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Theodore-Fifer-1)

I can only assure you from memory. The essay was written in 1988. I can’t find any interviews of her before 20102. I stopped tracking Whiteness Studies in 1999, and back then, when I was paying attention, she didn’t want to speak up about it. So the trick will be to find a competing academic who has a reason to call her on her new found celebrity to say with the particulars.

I suspect such a person would be Adrian Piper, who knows quite definitely how the academy is playing race and identity games. But I’d bet she’s sick of the discussion as well.[Theodore Fifer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Theodore-Fifer-1)

Nonsense. Only by pointing out anecdotes of misuse does your position have a leg to stand on, and anecdotes are misleading as support for or against a position.

Likewise, offering anecdotes of White people who do not enjoy privilege and Black people who do not obviously suffer from its impact is not a particularly compelling argument against the notion of statistical probabilities based on systemic and society advantage and disadvantage based on racism.

It’s a hoax resulting from Horkheimer and other failed communist theorists trying to disrupt western democratic republics (because their economic theories failed, they try to destroy our cultures)…actually, communism (and ensuing BS literary theories) contains the seeds of its own destruction because Marx reversed Hegelian thought and based his ideas on a false premise concerning how reality functions…so, white privilege is BS.[Pad Tan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Pad-Tan)

White privilege:

[Black man was on the phone with his mom while in a hotel lobby -- and then the police were called](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/28/us/portland-hotel-police-black-guest-trnd/index.html "www.cnn.com")

Jesus gave this privilege to his white-followers. It must be codified into the Holy Bible.

Jesus found it fair to kick this man out of hotel because he didn’t have white skin.

“Race hustle”? How so? What possible advantage could a person like me get out of acknowledging that institutional racism still exists in the U.S. today?[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

You can get a job decyring institutional racism and never having any responsibility for actually identifying it and bringing guilty parties to trial. In fact the very reason you say ‘institutional racism’ is because somebody has already been paid to make you think of that thing. And yet, could you credibly tell me what is the name of the number one agreed upon racist institution in America? No you can’t, because ‘institutional racism’ is yet another fluffy ‘socially constructed’ term.

What you can do is check the docket of the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ and find individual suits brought that violate the statutes of the civil rights laws of this country. Then you could see how the institution of the justice system deals with real violations, rather then talk up the ghosts of Jim Crow and rattle political chains.

Bull shit. All of it. Peggy McIntosh wrote about the theory of white privilege but the term goes way back to chattel slavery. She didn’t invent shit. Like most things race it was invented by white people and now denied as being serious. White supremacy, white privilege were both terms white men and women used casually.

Now embarrassed by the terms you attempt to belittle them and cast them off as minor. They sound ridiculous in the twenty-first century. The concepts of white supremacy and white privilege are practiced vigorously but silently in America. The only thing that has changed is the vocal use of the terms. Do better.
