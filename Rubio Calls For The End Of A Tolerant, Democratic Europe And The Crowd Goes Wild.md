Just over an hour ago, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called for the end of a tolerant, democratic Europe and its break-up into a disparate group of smaller, Trumpist states, and the Europeans in the room gave him a standing ovation. The chair of the event, Wolfgang Ischinger even thanked Rubio for his wonderful “reassurance”. So, it seems that threats to invade Greenland do not matter, the unilateral, imposition of uneven tariffs on Europe never happened. Indeed, even the abandonment of Ukraine and the cozying up to Vladimir Putin was not really dividing the US and Europe.

One speech of questionable value, asking liberal, democratic Europe to agree to its own destruction, and the last 13 months just melt away?

If you want, you can watch Rubio’s whole speech and post speech interview here.

The immediate reporting of the speech, admittedly from US sources, echoed exactly what Ischinger said; that Rubio, to great European relief, had reassured Europeans about the US commitment to the transatlantic relationship. Here are some stories of that type.

[RFE/RL even exclaimed that Europe was breathing “a sigh of relief”](https://www.rferl.org/a/rubio-warning-munich-speech-/33678260.html) at the address. Of course RFE/RL is a Trumpist mouthpiece, so that must be taken with the biggest grain of salt.

All we can really hope for, however, is that the applause in the room was polite and not a sign of sincere relief. For if it is, Europe is even more full of suckers than it has seen over the past years, addicts so dependant on the idea of US power and leadership that they will take this free dose fentanyl and recede back into their haze of dependence.

And if they do, they will have no one to blame but themselves. For Rubio’s speech, in reality, pronounced the death of the liberal, democratic system that has governed the European continent (and the US-led world) since 1945.

The speech started with an attack on everything that the US stood for before Donald Trump. Around 26 minutes on the video above, Rubio begins to dissect the disastrous world that the USA constructed before Donald Trump rode to the rescue. This world, based on liberal democracy, commerce and the “rules based order” was, according to Rubio actually a “dangerous” and destructive “delusion”. To emphasize this fact, he used the word “delusion” multiple times.

*This is something you always need to keep in mind—MAGA hates the USA and what it stood for for almost a century. It is intensely anti-American.*

The overall point Rubio was making was that Europe was foolish in following America down this road of tolerance, democracy and liberalism. So what Rubio was calling for was a return to a world based on the primacy of national interest (good bye EU). He called for the end of the attempt to contend with climate change and presented “mass migration” in the typically MAGA scare-tactic way.

Then the salvation to all this horror was given by Rubio. Salvation came in the person of Donald Trump. Here is what he said exactly”

“Under President Trump, the United States of America will once again take on the task of renewal and restoration…”

And what does Rubio want? Europe to be good little boys and come along on the Trumpist ride. And for the next ten minutes, Rubio gave a MAGA stump speech about the value of “western” values. It was basically the 2025 National Security Strategy rehashed and restated. His vision of the future was all based on a rejection of the last 50 years. It was all about how “President Trump and the United States” want Europe to follow them down the MAGA road.

And guess who was not a threat in Rubio’s speech? Dictatorial Russia and China is the answer. They were never mentioned as threats or challenges to freedom by Rubio in any way. Indeed I think they were ignored entirely. Rubio’s threats were not dictatorial states, but immigration, trade, tolerance and, I suppose people who do not have religious faith.

It was only at the end in the brief question period that Russia and Ukraine were brought up—and it was typical Trumpist defense of Putin’s behavior. There was the bombast based on Trump claims without reality (India will buy no more Russian oil). When it came to “peace” Rubio said that all but the toughest issues remain. Maybe his most illuminating comment was that the USA wanted a deal that Ukraine can “live with” and Russia can “accept”.

Russia/Putin must always be kept happy.

In substance terms there was nothing in this speech that was not pure Trumpist propaganda and politics. Yes there were some nice words on history and partnership, but Europe and Ukraine were given nothing while they were asked to destroy what they are now and follow the great leadership of Donald J. Trump.

If Europeans were reassured by this speech and believe it means that the US remains committed to European freedom or defense against Russia, they will get everything they deserve.
