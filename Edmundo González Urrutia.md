Reflection: Yesterday and today, I have heard several analysts assert that the U.S. military operation on Venezuelan territory constitutes a violation of international law. That assertion omits essential legal elements.

Following the elections of July 2024, a significant majority of States has recognized Edmundo González Urrutia as the legitimately elected president. Nicolás Maduro, by usurping power through armed control of the state apparatus and obstructing the constitutional transition, has ceased to be considered, in legal terms, a legitimate representative of the Venezuelan State.

A regime that retains power without a valid legal title, represses the population, and blocks the popular will expressed in recognized elections cannot rely on Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter to protect itself against measures adopted with the aim of restoring constitutional order and democratic legality.

Although the elected president has not formally assumed office nor expressly requested military assistance, he has expressed agreement with measures aimed at reversing the usurpation, which, together with the international recognition of his legitimacy, allows for the argument that the intervention is intended to support the public authority against a de facto regime lacking legal legitimacy.

To this context is added a further significant legal fact: Nicolás Maduro is wanted by the federal justice system of the United States, specifically by the Southern District Court of New York, which formally accuses him of narcoterrorism offenses, among others. The operation was carried out in compliance with that valid judicial order, which adds a dimension of international judicial cooperation in the pursuit of serious transnational crimes.

Likewise, the systematic violations of human rights committed by the usurping regime strengthen the argumentative framework from the doctrine of the responsibility to protect (R2P), when ordinary mechanisms prove obstructed or ineffective.

International law does not grant immunity to those who hold power through de facto means in open contravention of the constitutional order. In this scenario, the military operation is not a violation of international law, but a legally defensible action aimed at restoring democratic sovereignty and enforcing pending international responsibilities.

Finally, I have published an article in which I examine the inadequacy of the response of international law in the face of twenty-six years of authoritarian exercise of power in Venezuela and the systematic commission of supranational crimes. The doctrine of the responsibility to

We must be serious: the illegitimacy of a regime does not automatically authorize the unilateral use of force. International law exists precisely so that morality, ideology, or convenience do not replace the rules. If the rules fall, we all fall.

Have you read article 2.7 of the UN Charter? From now on, we'll legitimize as world Sheriff whoever has the most ammunition. I remind you that that's how Hitler started, Stalin followed, and in between came imperialist Japan. What will come next? Greenland, Poland, or Taiwan..

The DI is an imperfect tool that everyone uses or not depending on convenience.

In the end, everything in the world is the law of the strongest with one excuse or another (all the powers and all the countries in the world do it)

Why do armies exist if not?

Excellent, the R2P has fallen on deaf ears, and it is a doctrine applicable to these regimes that are not only illegitimate but also persecute their own citizens. Music to my ears the Responsibility to Protect (R2P)

The thing is that many people are worried that now the US might come in and have influence over policies and leaders to its liking in the region, and that's why they want to use international law and multilateral organizations to somehow curb that ominous influence that's looming

I forgot about the oil issue and other interests. What a shame! My field is law, especially the kind applied to finding reasons of legality, where the naive only see interests. Especially when the goal is as worthy as recovering democracy in Venezuela. Assassins!
