Eric Weinstein:

Like everyone else, I looked at the shooting of Renee Nicole Good. From several angles. And frame by frame. I watched the reverse lights go out. The weapon leave its holster.

I looked at the before footage. The aftermath. I listened carefully to the audio. I heard the legal scholars commentary. The politicians. Etc.

But most of all, I watched it as a pair of amped up Federal Agents with a car and driver defying my orders in a tense situation. And then I watched it as a freaked out American female in fight-or-flight mode with a terrifying man trying to force open my driver-side door who may have barely noticed the other man in front of my car about to end my life.

My thoughts.

This was always going to happen. A bunch of political people we don’t know playing out a drama of Sanctuary Cities, voting strategies, refugee designations, border enforcement, immigration scams, etc.

Sooner or later, given enough time, a loving widower and single dad will also pick up a gun and find a 2A solution to his grief over the Surgeon who “transitioned” his only brainwashed child while he was working two jobs in a murder suicide.

Someone wearing a Candace t-shirt calling for America-First will shoot up a Pro-Israel rally in Florida chanting about “Noticing”, Nick Fuentes and wanting their country back. Or a person will spray-paint “Never Again” on a Cybertruck and drive it into a Michigan crowd screaming “From The River To The Sea!”

Etc.

We are being set, like wind up toys, to tear each other apart and ourselves apart. my own head has been filled with so many slogans and so much hate for you by so many different people no matter who you are.

We are all in this low grade revolution.

And it will be reset today by algorithms you didn’t program, filled by speeches you didn’t write, amplified by accounts you don’t know are bot farms, directed by political strategists whose names you do not know, undoing action you would never have taken in ways you would never agree to directed by famous people you don’t know personally.

And then there are protests. We have forgotten what they are.

Let me say something almost no one will tell you. And I am sure I will be lambasted for saying this as I have never heard it said to me explicitly:

There are really no such things as peaceful protests. A protest works because of a show of power which can be converted to a riot, uprising, lynching, or even a revolution.

Every group chanting in the streets is one toggle switch off of being a mob.

No one knows who has a gun. Police are often outnumbered and reliant on their training, camradare and weapons.

So my avuncular advice to those of you who have never yet gone to Kent State or Soweto Township or Peekskill New York: don’t be naive.

I am not saying don’t protest. Quite the opposite.

I’m saying study what protests are. Why they work. Realize that Gandhi was explicitly pro-violence and actively hated passivists with a passion that burned. I’m not insane. Look it up.

Don’t get played out there. This is a revolution I never wanted to happen and of which I would want no part given the choice. Charlie Kirk fell to it. As did this 37 year old. As nearly did Donald Trump.

It will kill more of us. Those stoking it from America First militants and Groypers to the Ultra Woke are profiting from it. But we will all get sucked in to varying degrees. Myself included.

So I am not going to be naive and say “Stay Safe out There!” to my fellow Americans.

I’m going to say I love you and know what you are getting yourself into: a low grade revolution grinding for nearly a decade now. May the best parts of your hopes for our country be worth the risks you are taking, and may you be conscious of them and manage them wisely to make our nation better.

And if you don’t understand the above, may you have the good fortune to be able to stay home until you better understand the forces around you that would sacrifice your life to make a point without a second thought.

Either way: Good luck.
