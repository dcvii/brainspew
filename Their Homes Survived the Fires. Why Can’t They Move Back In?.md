The day after the Eaton fire started, Miles Loudermilk and his parents drove through their Altadena, Calif., neighborhood, down street after street of burning and destroyed homes. They were shocked to find their home intact.

“We were just elated that the house was still there,” Loudermilk said.

But the family was left with more questions than answers. They don’t know whether the home is habitable or how long and costly the cleanup process might be.

“It’s probably going to be a lot of smoke and ash damage,” Loudermilk said. 

While thousands of structures have been [completely destroyed](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/los-angeles-fire-housing-shortage-a1424502?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline) by the Los Angeles wildfires, many others within the fire perimeters are still standing. But that doesn’t mean residents will be able to move back in any time soon.

Government authorities first need to clear the neighborhoods of hazardous material. Then property owners can start working with insurance adjusters and restoration companies to repair damage to their buildings, furniture and possessions. Electricity and water services need to be restored, and some older damaged homes might also have asbestos that needs to be removed.

“The properties have been damaged beyond belief,” said Mark Pestrella, director of Los Angeles County Public Works, at a press conference last week. “They are full of sediment, debris, silt and hazardous materials.”

Homeowners with minimal damage can expect to return within weeks, but restoration specialists say it could take months before homes with major damage become fully habitable again. 

“I’m preparing myself mentally for months, rather than weeks,” said Christine Taylor. 

She visited her house in Pacific Palisades, which survived the Palisades fire, to pick up some items this week. The outside looked the same, but Taylor noticed soot residue and an acrid smell inside the house. Taylor, who is 83 years old and has owned her home since 1985, plans to stay with her partner in Brentwood until she can move back.

Even when she can return, Taylor expects she will have to drive to Santa Monica to buy groceries because of the [scale of the destruction](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/fierce-winds-unrelenting-flames-and-rushed-evacuations-the-night-wildfires-engulfed-los-angeles-3dba318c?mod=article_inline) in Pacific Palisades. “It’s as if you’ve relocated to another town, in a way—it will be like that,” she said.

Homeowners’ insurance policies should typically cover the cost of the cleanup, but the extent of the coverage can vary. After the [2021 Marshall Fire](https://www.wsj.com/articles/colorado-wildfire-destroys-nearly-1-000-homes-11641083822?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline) in Colorado, homeowners whose houses suffered smoke damage fought with their insurers about whether items in their homes needed to be fully replaced or if cleaning them was sufficient, said Michael McCarron, owner of Lakeside Insurance, an agency in Arvada, Colo. 

“These were the hardest claims,” he said. “You’re in a gray area \[to determine\] what is reasonable.”

California home insurance has become [more expensive and harder to obtain](https://www.wsj.com/finance/california-home-insurance-los-angeles-palisades-fire-3cce96a9?mod=article_inline) in recent years, and many wildfire victims could be underinsured or even uninsured.

The longer it takes to access the homes, the worse the damage could get, especially if any part of a house’s interior was exposed to the outside, said Jeff Moore, president of restoration company ATI Restoration.

“It could be something as simple as one blown-in window—it’s amazing the amount of smoke that can come into your house,” he said. “Smoke is one of those things that goes everywhere.”

Smoke damage can permeate a home’s walls, carpet, furniture and HVAC systems. In some cases, it might be necessary to remove a home’s drywall to address smoke damage, Moore said. Clothing and artwork might need to be specially cleaned.

Homes might also have water damage from hoses or sprinkler systems. Water can damage multiple areas of a home and cause mold growth if not treated immediately. 

After Hurricane Helene [swept through](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/hurricane-helene-florida-storm-path-7e135b34?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline) the Tampa Bay area last year, David Zigler was unable to find workers to tear the drywall out of his two-bedroom home in St. Petersburg after the storm. 

“It started growing within days, you could see it starting to grow,” said Zigler of the mold that took hold of his furniture and doors. He ultimately got rid of his kitchen cabinets and cut out sections of his plasterboard walls.

Because of the extent of the flood damage, Zigler learned he would have to tear down and rebuild his home. He signed a contract last week to sell his home of 25 years for $200,000. Months later, there are still piles of rubble dotting the neighborhood, he said.

Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, David Ruh couldn’t enter his New Orleans home again for about a week. “When I opened my door, I had mold going up 6 feet on my walls,” he said.

He hired a company that ripped out the affected drywall, but they were offered a better-paying job by someone else and didn’t come back the next day. He hired a second crew, but they were also lured away the following day with a better offer.

“Whoever had the money and resources got their homes fixed first,” Ruh said.

Restoration companies can start their work in California as soon as local authorities provide access to the affected areas, even if power or other utilities haven’t been restored yet, said Brett Ponton, chief executive of restoration company Servpro.

Michelle Bolotin and her partner, Joey Sagal, think their townhouse in Pacific Palisades is intact based on videos that neighbors have sent, but they haven’t been able to visit themselves.

“We don’t know what’s going on inside the house, we don’t know if the other side of the house is burned,” Bolotin said. “It might be completely toxic.”
