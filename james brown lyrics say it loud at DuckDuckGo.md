Uh! With your bad self  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
  
Look a'here  
Some people say we got a lot of malice  
Some say it's a lotta nerve  
But I say we won't quit moving  
Until we get what we deserve  
We've been buked and we've been scourned  
We've been treated bad, talked about  
As sure as you're born  
But just as sure as it take two eyes to make a pair, huh  
Brother, we can't quit until we get our share  
  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
One more time  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
  
I've worked on jobs with my feet and my hands  
But all the work I did was for the other man  
And now we demands a chance  
To do things for ourselves  
We tired of beating our heads against the wall  
And working for someone else  
  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
  
Oowee! You're killing me  
Alright! Uh! You're out of sight  
Alright! So tough, you're tough enough  
Oowee! Uh! You're killing me, ow!  
  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it louder (I'm black and I'm proud)  
  
Now, we demands a chance to do things for ourselves  
We tired of beating our heads against the wall  
And working for someone else  
Look a'here, there's one more thing I got to say right here  
Now, we're people  
We're like the birds and the bees  
But we'd rather die on our feet  
Than keep living on our knees  
  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Lord'a, Lord'a, Lord'a  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
  
Uh! Alright now! Lord!  
You know we can do the Boogaloo  
Now we can say we do the Funky Broadway  
Now we do  
Sometimes we dance, we sing, and we talk  
You know I do like to do the Camel Walk  
Alright now, alright  
Alright now, ha  
  
Say it loud (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it louder (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Let me hear ya  
Say it louder (I'm black and I'm proud)  
Say it louder (I'm black and I'm proud)
