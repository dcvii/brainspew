	days, while watching closely for signs of heavy bleeding (refer to Page 3 for post-biopsy
	Instructions).

	(Advil/Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren), etc.), vitamins and supplements for 7
	days prior to the procedure (refer to list on page 2). Tylenol (as directed on the bottle) is fine to take.
	3\. Be sure to check-in 1 hour to 45 minutes priorto your biopsy appointmenttime. We ask
	that you check-in within that timeframe so there will be enough time for the nursing staff to
	prepare for your procedure and for you to receive a 1-time dose of an antibiotic called
	booked at 7:30 am may check-in at 7:00 – 7:15 am.
	perform the enema 1-2 hours or more before you leave for your appointment. If you have a
	morning appointment, you may perform the enema the night before. You can buy the enema at
	any drugstore without a prescription. Please follow the directions on the box.
	5\. Before or after the enema, you may have a LIGHT breakfast/lunch/snack the day of the
	procedure (e.g.toast, coffee, protein bar, half a sandwich or soup).

	AFTER YOUR BIOPSY:
	- It is extremely important that you monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. If you become ill, develop a fever of over 101° F, have problems urinating, experience severe pain or heavy bleeding, please immediately seek medical attention by calling our office, or visiting your local doctor/urgent care facility/ER.
	- Right after your biopsy, some blood may be noted in the urine and/or stool for a few days (+/- one week) and in the semen for up to 6 - 8 weeks. The amount of bleeding from the biopsy should lessen over time.
	- After the biopsy, sitting in a tub of warm water and taking Tylenol should alleviate any discomfort you may have. You may be able to urinate better while sitting in the water.
	- You may resume your normal diet after your prostate biopsy. If rectal soreness occurs, try to avoid foods and beverages that can irritate the bladder and bowels, such as caffeinated beverages, alcohol and spicy foods.
	- Avoid sexual activity/ejaculation and strenuous exercise such as jogging, heavy lifting, golfing and bike riding for 2 days after your biopsy. These activities may place too much pressure on the prostate and make any bleeding from the biopsy worse.
	FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:
	Biopsy results are usually available 7-10 business days after the procedure.
	Please contact your ordering physician’s office listed below to discuss your results.
