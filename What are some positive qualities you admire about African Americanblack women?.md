These are my women. My wife and my two daughters. They are everything I expect from women and that is why I treasure, provide for and defend them with my life. I don't happen to have a picture with them and my mother, besides if I got a bigger picture with all of the important women in my life, we'd be here all day. As it is, I'm going to try and keep this to 15 mintues of writing.

First of all they are each different and exemplify a distinct combination of admirable virtues. None of them try to be somebody they are not. They are strikingly individual.

**Courtney Alexandra** is possessed of strong emotional intelligence. She has talked to grownups since she was 7. She is modest and hard working but is never afraid to take risks. She handles her business and the moment she fails, she shares her pain and gets back on the horse with the assistance of people she can trust to help her. So she is undaunted by defeat and therefore mostly unstoppable. She is compassionate and trustworthy. She is open and accommodating. She leads by establishing harmony, and she is a model citizen. She was head cheerleader and Gold Award Girl Scout. She is sorted into Hufflepuff. She's got your back. She's the world traveler.

**Cynthia Ann** is a model of determination. She is embarrassingly hard working and dedicated. She is a master of coordination and organization. She sees all and is always giving directions. She is thorough, with a casual sort of persuasion. You are never being talked down to, but you will hear the words. Women find her very strong and gravitate to her constancy. She never flakes out. She is dedicated to her family with singleminded purpose. She is amazingly creative in ways you never expect. She is a masterful cook, caterer, party planner, event coordinator and general all-around circus ring master. Nothing escapes her watchful eyes. Yet she has that humble grace that can be kind and brutally honest at the same time. You want to know what she thinks.

**Kira Noelle** is a striking beauty with a devastatingly quick wit. She is a born scholar-athlete who hates to lose in any endeavor. She is a pistol-shooter, surfer, skateboarder and hurdler. She edited the school newspaper and speaks fluent Spanish. Right now she's a junior at San Diego State in International Relations. She asks the most pointed questions and gets right down to the heart of the matter, but she's comfortable in every situation. She is precise and disciplined in her demeanor and with money. Sooner or later, you will end up owing her money. She sold so many Girl Scout cookies that she won a cruise. Head for business. Body for sports. Attitude for over-achievement. She plays poker with life, for the win.

I love and respect them. They love and respect me. Win. Win. Win.

Mr Bowen, I’d like to get your approval before asking for Kira’s hand in marriage - I probably can’t afford the dowry fee, but I’m sure she’ll lend it to me:)
