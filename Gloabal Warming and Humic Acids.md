To answer this question we first need to see if there is any evidence of a large amount of carbon being sequestered in the soil for long periods of time (geological time). Otherwise all we have is decaying biomass, which is a very beneficial part of the cycle of life, but not part of the deep carbon cycle.

Turns out in soil science for over 100 years we knew about a certain class of soils called Mollisols or mollic soils. These are the famous corn belt soils of Illinois and Iowa etc. and the whole former tallgrass prairies in the US and the equally famous breadbasket black soils of Ukraine in European steppe.

> “The origin of the mollic epipedon is only partially understood; however, the relation between Mollisols and grassland or steppe has been recognized for more than a century (Shantz 1923). Soils containing a mollic epipedon are among the world’s most productive soils (Liu et al. 2012). The thickness and high soil organic carbon (SOC) contents of the mollic epipedon mean that these soils have sequestered large amounts of C over long periods of time.” [Mollic Epipedon](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-06668-4_5 "link.springer.com")

As it turns out it goes back well into deep geological time too. [Cenozoic Expansion of Grasslands and Climatic Cooling](http://blogs.uoregon.edu/gregr/files/2013/07/grasslandscooling-nhslkh.pdf "blogs.uoregon.edu")

So bingo! We have found the natural biome that fits our requirements, lots of carbon over long periods of time. Nothing is forever, but this fits the bill for sustainable in any rational time frame.

But exactly how does this work? And can we model agriculture in a way that takes advantage of this process? Well for at least 100 years we have been investigating this, but it really was a counter-intuitive thing. Forests for example contain much more biomass, and a much thicker leaf litter on the forest floor, yet those soils in comparison are usually very low in carbon and quite poor once you get past the decaying leaf litter. There are a couple exceptions, but the rule holds surprising well across most the land surface of the planet. We could pile on mulch or manure or compost and yes it made great crops for a year or two, but after a couple years it all rots away and we are back where we started. We could plow or till it in, and it helps that year, but we still needed to do it all over again next year anyway.

So something was going on that we couldn’t quite figure out. The closest any agricultural technology came to actually mimicking this soil creation process was [Terra Preta de Indio](http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html "www.css.cornell.edu"), an ancient native South American technique. That does work, but it certainly couldn’t be how the vast natural prairies did it. So we still hadn’t discovered the missing link in that biochemical chain.

Then in 1996 a soil scientist by the name of Dr Sara Wright discovered a soil protein with glue like properties she named Glomalin

[[1]](https://qrd.quora.com/As-humic-acids-are-containing-lots-of-carbon-could-grassland-carbon-farming-create-a-significant-and-sustainable-carb?ch=99&share=2fa4642e#UzmGw)

.

> Glomalin eluded detection until 1996 because, “It requires an unusual effort to dislodge glomalin for study: a bath in citrate combined with heating at 250 F (121 C) for at least an hour.... No other soil glue found to date required anything as drastic as this.” - Sara Wright.

I have said it many times, and I will say it again, there has been no scientific discovery in chemistry more important than this in the history of chemistry. She deserves the Nobel prize in chemistry more than any living human being on the planet!

The reason of course is that this is the missing link in a long biochemical chain that ultimately pumps huge tonnages of carbon into the soil annually. And unlike biomass, it stays there into deep geological time frames unless disturbed.

To understand this better lets look at a soil profile.

Now the O - horizon is primarily decaying biomass. This illustration shows it thin as is typically found in grasslands, as they have far less above ground biomass. An old growth forest might have a much thicker O - horizon in some cases, or in other more tropical and wet areas it might even be thinner because leaves rot so fast in a tropical rain forest. In either case this is not the horizon we need to focus on.

It’s the thickness and high carbon content of the A and B - horizons of a mollisol that make it special. This carbon is deeper and far less actually cycles back into the atmosphere as CO2. But why? We have plowed and plowed and plowed organic matter into these horizons and the results were always net carbon losses, not gains. It always just rots away. It seemed a mollisol really was impossible to recreate with agriculture.

That’s where Glomalin comes in and its glue like properties. Learn more here:

It turns out when we plow, we kill the glomalin producing Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) that require a living plant root to survive. So not only was the plowing in of organic matter temporary only, it actually made soils degrade. Of course there are a lot of spores in the soil, so usually a new crop would grow more symbiotic AMF.

But then we changed agriculture in what was called the “green revolution”.

We did boost yields with these new hybrid crops, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, but the soils rapidly began degrading. This was an unexpected emergent property, but it turns out to be a very important one. In a relatively short period of time all the worlds agricultural soils started degrading, some severely.

[Only 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation Continues](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/ "www.scientificamerican.com")

Luckily in the corn belt and bread belts of the world the soils were incredibly deep. So we had enough time to try and figure out a solution. Turns out our Hero in this story Dr. Sara Wright came to the rescue in the last chapter! Further study shows exactly whats happening.

See we use chemical fertilizers to supply Nitrogen/Phosphorus/Potassium (NPK). Unknowingly this bypasses the function of the soil food web in general and glomalin producing AMF in particular.

[Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus Rhizophagus irregularis Increased Potassium Content and Expression of Genes Encoding Potassium Channels in Lycium barbarum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5372814/ "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov")

and

[Substantial nitrogen acquisition by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from organic material has implications for N cycling](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/31/13754 "www.pnas.org")

but more importantly, when we fertilize the soil with large quantities of NPK fertilizers, it shuts down this important function.

[Phosphorus and Nitrogen Regulate Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis in Petunia hybrida](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0090841 "journals.plos.org")

Something else too. Unlike saprophytic fungi which cause decay of organic matter in the O horizon releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere, AMF need a living root at all times to survive. So not only does using NPK fertilizers shut down the LCP, so do herbicides and plowing and even some fungicides.

In fact pretty much everything Green Revolution Agriculture does now as common Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) unknowingly shuts down the Liquid Carbon Pathway (LCP). It's no wonder it took so long to discover. Any time you see a study making claims of the potential rate of soil carbon sequestration, you need to look deeper and see if either standard green revolution methods are being used, or improved no till green revolution methods defined by the USDA as GAP. But also keep in mind, while not as bad, even standard organic methods still disturb the soil with the plow and that organic compost and manure doesn’t last.

Turns out GAP was defined PRIOR to the discovery of glomalin and the LCP. So it is our best management practices, both organic and industrial that have caused the problem.

Now that we know how when and why it happens, we also know how to fix it! As it turns out the measured rates of this carbon pump into the soil are significant enough to mitigate global warming too!

> "If all farmland was a net sink rather than a net source for CO2, atmospheric CO2 levels would fall at the same time as farm productivity and watershed function improved. This would solve the vast majority of our food production, environmental and human health ‘problems’." Dr. Christine Jones

Talk about a beneficial side effect! I mean sure agriculture does need to change to these new methods that take advantage of the symbiosis with AMF anyway. So its going to happen eventually or else we have real issues of starvation worldwide and not just in poor pockets of developing countries. So I am sure that gradually over the next 50 to 100 years little by little this will change, but because of the sustainable effect on the carbon cycle is so large, it is also a global warming mitigation strategy too! We have the option to do the same sort of research and technology transfer initiatives that we did in the 50’s and 60’s again. This time though it will be the Forth Agricultural Revolution. In fact it has already started.
