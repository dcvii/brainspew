Discover the release date and order of each Season in Destiny 2, from the time the game first launched to the latest Season announced.

Destiny 2 has received about a dozen Seasons since its release. Every few months, a new Season begins, giving players new Power to chase, Exotics to unlock, and hopefully, new and exciting activities to experience. It can get a bit murky after all these years for any players looking to think back on a Season or work out how many there are. To help with this, below you’ll find a list of every Season in Destiny 2, in order, as well as a brief description of what it included. Expect for this guide to be updated every few months.

*Last updated on July 13, 2025.*

## All Seasons in Destiny 2

There are technically 20 Seasons in Destiny 2, with the seasonal model officially beginning after the release of Forsaken. Before then, Bungie was still utilizing a traditional DLC release schedule. Though they weren't officially called Seasons until much later, the base game and the first few DLC drops were retroactively numbered and are considered Seasons by Bungie and the community.

Each Season typically brings with it some new stories, Exotics to chase, and better gear to unlock. Bungie has also taken to releasing a new dungeon and a new/reprised raid on alternating seasons.

With the launch of The Final Shape, Bungie shifted away from the traditional Seasonal model and name and referred to them as Episodes. For simplicity, I've still used the traditional S-number format for these Episodes to keep it consistent.

Use the below Destiny 2 Season names to jump to the appropriate Season and read a brief overview of what it introduced. Some of these Seasons will be blank, pending further information and announcements from Bungie.

## The Light and Darkness Saga

### Season 1: Destiny 2 base – Year 1

![Season 1 Destiny 2 base game](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/resize?type=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshacknews-www.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Feditorial%2F2020%2F07%2Fseason-1-destiny-2-base-game.jpg&width=986&sign=yCsgYMJ8PLmXP_3CyuKgWTT_SEKwbiSD-ywB1cgQTX4)

The war with the Red Legion saw players lose their Light.

Destiny 2 originally launched back on September 6, 2017, on console and then on PC on October 24, 2017. This base game introduced players to new mechanics, a double-primary weapon setup, as well as other new and strange changes from the original game. Players would fight against Ghaul and the Red Legion, ultimately defeating the Cabal leader, and seeing the Traveler wake up from its slumber. It was here that players got their first glimpse of the Pyramid ships that would eventually be the focus of Shadowkeep some two years later.

### Season 2: Curse of Osiris

![Destiny 2 Season 2 Curse of Osiris](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/resize?type=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshacknews-www.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Feditorial%2F2020%2F07%2Fseason-2-curse-of-osiris-destiny-2.jpg&width=986&sign=hAwezxpqhMvAzAbR2nsm8n73H3q9VzPR0MeNSiPNUJc)

Curse of Osiris was a difficult moment for Destiny 2.

Curse of Osiris was the first DLC added to Destiny 2 on December 5, 2017, and is often considered the lowest point in the series. Players were jetted off to Mercury, where they helped Brother Vance and Osiris fight against Panoptes, a Vex Mind. Aside from forging a few weapons, there was really nothing going on in this season.

### Season 3: Warmind

![Destiny 2 Season 3 Warmind](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/resize?type=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshacknews-www.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Feditorial%2F2020%2F07%2Fseason-3-warmind-destiny-2.jpg&width=986&sign=3OPegAOSy5bUe8rVQohhjLr1mdgGhwvq6mFP-Mbq7TQ)

Warmind was the third and final mini-DLC released on May 8, 2018, before Bungie shifted to a seasonal model. Warmind took players back to Mars, where they helped Ana Bray and Rasputin take on a Hive worm god. The big appeal of this season was Escalation Protocol, a pseudo-wave defense activity, as well as the brutally-challenging quest, The Whisper, which rewarded [Whisper of the Worm](https://www.shacknews.com/article/106275/how-to-get-the-whisper-of-the-worm-in-destiny-2), a new version of Black Hammer/Black Spindle.

### Season 4: Forsaken / Season of the Outlaw – Year 2

![Destiny 2 Season 4 Forsaken Season of the Outlaw](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/resize?type=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshacknews-www.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Feditorial%2F2020%2F07%2Fseason-4-forsaken-destiny-2.jpg&width=986&sign=Aqjle4pBs2CqFEPIHh2XOcQBjSH4SHbnpGKJeswg7v8)

Released on September 4, 2018, Forsaken marked the first massive shift in direction of Destiny 2 and started Year 2. This major expansion changed just about every facet of the game, and is often considered Destiny 2’s own “The Taken King”. It also marked the introduction of a new end-game activity called a dungeon. These three-player activities are a mini-raid of sorts, demanding high Power levels, skill, and puzzle-solving. Those seeking more PVE-cross-PVP content were rewarded with Gambit, a mode that tasks two teams with defeating PVE combatants and invading the other team's world for a bit of PVP.

### Season 5: Season of the Forge

Season of the Forge was the first time a piece of DLC was officially classified as a "Season" and was released on December 4, 2018. Though there was a rocky launch with players unable to experience the first new activity due to a demanding Power requirement, Season of the Forge offered plenty of new gear for players to chase. This Season also went by the title, Black Armory.

### Season 6: Season of the Drifter

![Destiny 2 Season 6 Season of the Drifter](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/resize?type=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshacknews-www.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Feditorial%2F2020%2F07%2Fseason-6-season-of-the-drifter-destiny-2.jpg&width=986&sign=yRr5EozDfdBvvpjVvigrRkv54YcGZvsjTxlkXi4j7wg)

Who'd of thought that the sly Drifter would become such an integral part of the Destiny 2 story?

Season of the Drifter was released on March 5, 2019. This Season was also known as Joker’s Wild. Though light on new PVE activities, Season of the Drifter’s main focus was on Gambit, and the newly-introduced Gambit Prime and The Reckoning. Players were also able to unlock [Outbreak Perfected](https://www.shacknews.com/article/111624/outbreak-perfected-exotic-pulse-rifle-destiny-2), an Exotic Pulse Rifle that was called Outbreak Prime back in the original Destiny.

Season of Opulence was the next Season to join the ranks of Destiny 2 on June 4, 2019. The Season was an instant-success thanks to The Menagerie, a new PVE activity that allowed players to farm the exact weapon they wanted. The story also shined more light on the jubilant Emperor Calus and his Leviathan ship, which had been overrun with Hive.

### Season 8: Shadowkeep / Season of the Undying – Year 3

![Destiny 2 Season 8 Shadowkeep Season of the Undying](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/resize?type=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshacknews-www.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Feditorial%2F2020%2F07%2Fseason-8-shadowkeep-season-of-the-undying-destiny-2.jpg&width=986&sign=ihrWIjXELT4j0UzsJWOkmFxV5m7TUzkW5mUG45lgMAQ)

Shadowkeep was the second major expansion to hit Destiny 2 on October 1, 2019, and sets in motion Year 3. Though not as impressive as Forsaken, Shadowkeep seemed to finally hit some story notes players had been waiting for since the base game released two years prior. Players came face-to-face with the Darkness and its Pyramid ships, which would path the way for future releases.

The release of Shadowkeep also kicked off a new Season, Season of the Undying, which introduced a 100-rank Season Pass for the first time and a new mechanic, the seasonal artifact. This artifact would allow players to gain as much Power as they could by gaining exponentially more XP. Players would also be able to chase higher Power levels with a new Pinnacle system, which would grant 10 Power above the Season's soft cap, a difficult task for even the veteran players.

This Season also marked the release of a free version of Destiny 2 called New Light.

### Season 9: Season of Dawn

Season of Dawn was released on December 10, 2019, and took players back to Mercury for the first time since Curse of Osiris. This time, the story was far more impressive, with players rescuing Saint-14 (a legendary figure players have discussed since the original title) from the time-bending Vex.

Season of the Worthy was the tenth season added to Destiny 2 on March 10, 2020. The primary focus of this season was Trials of Osiris, the new Seraph Tower public event, and the Seraph Bunkers. This Season culminated with the Warmind Rasputin destroying the Cabal-controlled ship, The Almighty, in Destiny 2’s first live event.

Though the previous seasons were by no means unpopular, Destiny 2 really hit another stride when Season of Arrivals released on June 9, 2020. This Season added Umbral Engrams, which allowed players to chase very specific weapons with greater ease. The story also reached a new height, with Pyramid ships appearing around several planets including Io, Titan, Mars, and Mercury.

### Season 12: Beyond Light / Season of the Hunt – Year 4

![Destiny 2 Season 12 Beyond Light](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/resize?type=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshacknews-www.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Feditorial%2F2020%2F07%2Fseason-12-beyond-light-destiny-2.jpg&width=986&sign=Wohzno__WYFnWmm2RxxODkHt7FXWBvO7lBdUtkTPbsw)

Beyond Light released on November 10, 2020, and was Year 4 of Destiny 2. This new Season looks to add new elemental powers for the first time since The Taken King in the original Destiny several years ago. Players will be able to wield the power of the Darkness in the form of icy “stasis” abilities. Beyond Light will also be the first time Bungie removes massive amounts of content, with Io, Titan, Mars, and Mercury being “vaulted”, along with any activities tied to those locations. Beyond Light also included Season of the Hunt, which started on November 17, 2020.

If Beyond Light follows the same seasonal model, players could likely expect three additional Seasons before the next major expansion.

Source: Bungie

In a Destiny update called, [The Road to the Witch Queen](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50124), Bungie revealed that it would need an additional chapter after Lightfall to wrap up what it refers to as the "Light and Darkness Saga". The Final Shape will also shake up the seasonal model, shifting to an Episode structure with three Episodes each consisting of three Acts which last for six weeks each. The first Episode (Echoes) will begin one week after the release of The Final Shape on June 11, 2024 (though this is subject to change).

On October 30, 2023, reports surfaced that [Bungie fired numerous members of its development team](https://www.shacknews.com/article/137589/bungie-staff-layoffs-destiny-2 "Bungie layoffs appear to target community and social teams") and that [The Final Shape would be delayed](https://www.shacknews.com/article/137588/destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-delayed "The Final Shape would be delayed") until June 2024. At the time, it wasn't clear whether the fourth season in Lightfall would last several months or if there would be another season or two between it and the release of The Final Shape.
