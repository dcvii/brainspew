Remittances from migrants & refugees in the US provides more money to the home networks USAID sponsors in target countries than USAID itself 🧵

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GkHAQ3mWUAAPbLR.jpg) 2/ Remittances are when a migrant or refugee has money or makes money here in the US, and then sends money back to friends and relatives in their home country.  
  
So, for example, Ukraine refugees who flee then have their lives paid for here by aid programs will send cash back home ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GkHBZG0WoAAv5ib.jpg)

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GWDN3ZZXMAAEPZ3.jpg) 2 weeks after Tucker interviewed Pavel, the CIA-founded Radio Free Europe (run directly by the CIA for its first 20 years), ran a long piece insinuating Russia was secretly controlling Telegram & Ukraine must seize control of it instead as a military intelligence imperative. ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GWDN3ZZXMAAEPZ3.jpg) Straight out of a Benzpill lecture, the piece begins by lauding how wonderful Telegram is for (CIA-backed) rent-a-riots in Belarus, Iran, & in Russia itself. It applauded Telegram’s 2014-2020 era bc Pavel never gave in to the foreign gov’ts the CIA was using Telegram to topple.

Thank you @EricRWeinstein for the shout-out! Below in this thread, I’ll post the USAID Blob Guide to censoring the Internet. Also, it’s this exact network everyone will learn a whoooole lot more about on Sunday-Monday when the thing I’ve been working on all month finally drops…

Below is USAID, which was set up to be a State Dept foreign policy funnel for overt US gov’t initiatives & CIA funding conduit to rush cash to US gov’t covert initiatives, proposing 31 times to financially bankrupt anyone who speaks or hosts online speech that challenges them

I’m escaping to a small farm in the remote jungles of Costa Rica for the next few days while I plot next moves  
  
Will continue to semi-inappropriately use 𝕏 as an Instagram / TikTok travelogue cannibalizer but hey when I see the world u come with me <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1766253323168985088/pl/aIqvtB4WILgjE1wc.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=cmaf" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1766253323168985088/vid/avc1/480x270/DaEDovNg_FPY9GiD.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1766253323168985088/vid/avc1/640x360/DI76PorCkGzH4yl-.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1766253323168985088/vid/avc1/1280x720/B7WSKOA5lSIIS9NU.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video> Just adding here so I can keep my travelogue confined to this thread. Update / good news: after a 3-hour flight, a 4-hour taxi, & a 1.5-hour 4x4 ride, I have finally arrived in what appears to be inner-most armpit tuck of the Costa Rican jungle

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGpEXOiWMAAEf4h.png) A lot of people are asking how to support my work. Honestly, the best way is just subscribe to me here on 𝕏. It's $5/month, & the value is I do a weekly research stream annotating my work live as I do it, plus a weekly 2-hour Q&A AMA.  
  
Sunday Office Hours today are 3-5pm ET 🙏 ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGpEXOiWMAAEf4h.png) The vibe is deliberately a lot of fun. A kind of private party for people interested in going deep. The cinematic universe of the censorship industry is a pretty dark place, so during subscriber streams I try to let my hair down (pretend w/ me 😂) & make everything relatable
