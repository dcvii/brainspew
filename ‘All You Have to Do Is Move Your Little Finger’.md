***Welcome to Things Worth Remembering, our weekly column in which writers share a poem or a paragraph that all of us should commit to heart. This week, Joe Nocera reflects on the lyrics of Stephen Sondheim’s “The Gun Song,” which can be read today as a chilling premonition of America’s age of mass shootings.***

In 1990, Stephen Sondheim, the great musical theater composer, wrote a wrenching song about gun violence. [The lyrics Sondheim wrote](https://genius.com/James-barbour-michael-cerveris-denis-ohare-and-becky-ann-baker-the-gun-song-lyrics) for “The Gun Song,” as it was simply titled, have haunted me for years. Here’s how it begins:

> *It takes a lot of men to make a gun*
> 
> *Hundreds*
> 
> *Many men to make a gun*
> 
> *Men in the mines to dig the iron,*
> 
> *Men in the mills to forge the steel,*
> 
> *Men at machines to turn the barrel,*
> 
> *Mold the trigger, shape the wheel*
> 
> *It takes a lot of men to make a gun...*
> 
> *One gun...*

And then comes the chorus—or is it the punchline?

> *And all you have to do*
> 
> *Is move your little finger*
> 
> *Move your little finger and \[click\]*
> 
> *You can change the world.*

These lyrics came back to me in 1999, when two students [opened fire](https://vault.fbi.gov/Columbine%20High%20School%20) at Columbine High School, killing 12 of their fellow students and one teacher, and wounding 21 others. ([A wounded student died](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/columbine-school-shooting-death-toll.html) from her injuries this year.) It may not have been the first school shooting—that took place at the University of Texas in 1966—but it was the one that, for some reason, opened a Pandora's box that has never since been shut.

These lyrics came back to me in 2012, after the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre, when 20 first graders and six adult staff were gunned down by 20-year-old Adam Lanza—the tragedy that compelled me to begin writing about gun violence.

And they came to me again on Wednesday, when the news scrolled across my screen: A mass shooting had taken place at a Catholic church in Minneapolis. In the hours that followed, the details began trickling out, and [they were gruesome](https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-governor-says-shooting-has-taken-place-minneapolis-catholic-school).

It was the first week of school, and the children at Annunciation Catholic School were attending Mass before classes began. As the service began, someone “in his early 20s and dressed in black clothing” began shooting a rifle through the church’s stained-glass windows. By the time the assassin had finished, two children, ages 8 and 10, were dead, and 17 others were wounded, some of them critically. The shooter, whose name was Robin Westman, had written antisemitic phrases on the barrel of his weapons (“6 million wasn’t enough”), had posted a bizarre video “manifesto” to YouTube, and had turned out to be a trans woman. When Westman’s killing spree was completed, the killer then turned a gun on himself. Investigators were said to be [scouring the manifesto](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/minneapolis-shooting-robin-westman-annunciation-catholic-school-live-updates-b2815465.html), hoping to determine a motive for the attack.

And this wasn’t even the only mass shooting in Minneapolis *this week*. On Tuesday, a man with a high-powered rifle [killed one person](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/08/26/minneapolis-shooting-one-dead-six-hurt) and injured six others after he walked up to the group as they stood on a corner.

There have been, so far in 2025, 339 mass shootings in the U.S., resulting in 388 deaths and 1,411 injuries, according to a database called [Mass Shooting Tracker](https://massshootingtracker.site/data/?year=2025). (It defines mass shootings as “an incident where four or more people are shot in a single shooting spree.”)

Some of these attacks were front-page news, such as the Minneapolis massacre and the [shooting in Midtown Manhattan](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/nyregion/park-avenue-shooting-victims.html) in late July that killed four people, including a police officer and a high-ranking female executive at Blackstone. But most scarcely got a mention beyond the local evening news; mass shootings have become so commonplace they barely cause anyone to raise an eyebrow anymore.

Sondheim, who [died in 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/theater/stephen-sondheim-dead.html) at the age of 91, was a brilliant man, but he wasn’t so prescient that he anticipated mass shootings. Rather, “ [The Gun Song](https://kcopera.org/advisory-the-gun-song-in-context/) ” was written for a [show called](https://stageagent.com/shows/musical/1424/assassins) *[Assassins](https://stageagent.com/shows/musical/1424/assassins)*, in which he and John Weidman, who wrote the libretto, interweave the stories of nine presidential assassins (or would-be assassins), including Abraham Lincoln’s killer, John Wilkes Booth, and John Hinckley Jr., who attempted to kill Ronald Reagan in 1981.

The show ends with all the assassins gathered together on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where they urge on Lee Harvey Oswald, who is contemplating shooting John F. Kennedy as the presidential motorcade drives through Dealey Plaza in Dallas.

I realize that my brief description of *Assassins* doesn’t exactly make you want to race to the theater to see it, and indeed, when it was first produced off-Broadway in 1990, most critics panned it. But a subsequent Broadway revival in 2004 garnered the show its due. It won [five Tony awards](https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/assassins-13580#Awards), with *The* *New York* *Times* ’ Ben Brantley calling it “ [a glitteringly dark musical](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/23/movies/theater-review-a-demon-gallery-of-glory-hounds.html).” In his review, Brantley also wrote this:

> *Assassins* does not celebrate its homicidal subjects. Mr. Sondheim and Mr. Weidman are simply posing a question that arises in many people’s minds when they read accounts of shocking, irrational crimes: “Why would someone do that?”

*Why would someone do that*? That *is* the question, isn’t it—not just about assassination attempts but also about mass shootings? It is a question Peter Savodnik delved into earlier this week in [his perceptive essay](https://www.thefp.com/p/robin-westman-and-the-rise-of-american-nihilism-minneapolis-shooting) for *The Free Press*. Peter’s conclusion is that the rise of mass violence is related, as he puts it, to “the nihilist impulse coursing through America, which has been mostly stripped of its faith and a shared national culture.”

Sondheim and Weidman’s explanation for the underlying psychological motivation driving assassins is not nihilism but a series of other factors: a desire to be paid attention to; a seething resentment toward “the bosses”; a sense of dissatisfaction, or loneliness, or failure. Aren’t these things that drive mass shooters as well?

Hinckley tried to kill Reagan because he was under the delusion that it would bring him to the attention of—and win the heart of—the actor Jodie Foster. Charles Guiteau, obsessed with fame, [assassinated President James Garfield](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/this-is-the-brain-that-shot-president-james-garfield/454212/) because Garfield had denied him a position in the White House—and because killing the president “would promote the sales of my book.” Giuseppe Zangara, an unemployed bricklayer whose stomach was in constant pain, yelled “Too many people are starving” when [he shot at (and missed)](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2673&context=fhq) Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was upset that there were no newsreel cameras [at his execution](https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/334329), which he viewed as a protest against “capitalists” and the “crooked government.”

In the show’s [penultimate scene](https://youtu.be/mMVnLSAmSvs?feature=shared), as the assassins are pushing a reluctant Oswald to kill JFK, Oswald says in a frightened voice, “People will hate me.”

“They will hate you with a passion,” replies Booth. “Imagine people having passionate feelings about Lee Harvey Oswald.”

Yes. Imagine people having passionate feelings about Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Imagine the anger of the man who stormed into a Midtown Manhattan high-rise with a rifle, [hoping to kill employees](https://abcnews.go.com/US/midtown-shooting-suspect-left-note-mentioning-nfl-cte/story?id=124163966) of the National Football League because he was convinced that the football he played in high school caused brain damage. Except Shane Tamura was celebrated instead because he murdered a private equity executive.

Imagine 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, morphing from a nerdy engineering student to a bomb-maker in his bedroom before [attempting to kill Donald Trump](https://www.cbsnews.com/lifeofthomascrooks/) last July. Imagine Westman, posting a manifesto on YouTube, knowing that millions were likely to see it and talk about it on social media, and that it would be dissected for clues to understanding his disturbed mind.

Many of the same psychological factors that drove the assassins in Sondheim and Weidman’s show also drive mass shooters today.

Pulling the trigger requires nihilism, but it requires more than that as well. It requires getting your hands on a weapon. And it’s never been easier. It no longer takes a hundred men to make a gun. Smith & Wesson, with some [1,000 employees](https://smokinggun.org/manufacturer/smith-wesson/#:~:text=Smith%20%26%20Wesson%20manufactured%202%2C317%2C792%20firearms%20in%202021.&text=ATF%2C%202021%20Annual%20Firearms%20Manufacturers,%2Dexport%2Dreport%2Dafmer.), makes just under 9,000 guns a day. If you know how to do it, you can make a gun [with a 3D printer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQB_ib-KQXA), as Mangione is said to have done.

And here’s what else it requires. In “ [The Gun Song](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=qXlaU-vO7Uw),” Sara Jane Moore—who [attempted to assassinate](https://hyperallergic.com/957620/a-woman-who-tried-to-kill-the-president-tells-her-story-suburban-fury/) President Gerald Ford in 1975—sings about her.38 revolver. It’s a small gun, she acknowledges, but even with a.38 “you can make a statement.”

Assassins and mass shooters know that all too well. It is an essential truth we should all remember.
