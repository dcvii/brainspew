- **The Trump administration says it's going to eliminate stop-start technology from cars, with EPA chief Lee Zeldin calling the technology "absurd."**
- ***Car and Driver* wonders how a change in policy on this scale would actually work, considering most of the nation's newer vehicles already have the tech onboard.**
- **Here's what seven major automakers said when we reached out.**

***UPDATE 2/16/26:** We've added a statement from Stellantis.*

As part of a [sweeping policy change](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a70328142/epa-boss-lee-zeldin-us-plans-stop-start-systems/), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says that it's "eliminating" engine stop-start systems from American roads. How will this regulatory change play out in our vehicles, given that millions of cars are already in operation with this system in place? Only time will tell, but we wanted to know what the automakers have to say about this recent decision. So we asked.

**Hyundai's statement** was the most specific we received, pointing out that the EPA's rule changes simply remove incentives for automakers to use this technology, rather than banning it: "Start‑stop technology has never been federally mandated, and the EPA’s recent action removes regulatory incentives associated with it rather than prohibiting its use. Hyundai continues to comply with all applicable emissions regulations and regularly evaluates vehicle technologies based on customer feedback, regulatory requirements, and overall efficiency. At this time, we will continue to assess future developments as regulations evolve."

**A statement from Stellantis**, too, implied that stop-start systems would remain in its vehicles. The company said, "Start/stop technology availability will continue to vary by vehicle and market. As always, we evaluate customer preferences, regulatory requirements, and overall vehicle design when making product decisions."

**Ford's statement** was less specific about how these policy changes could affect its vehicles but appears clearly in support of the change: "We appreciate the work of President Trump and Administrator Zeldin to address the imbalance between current emissions standards and customer choice. Ford has consistently advocated for a single, stable national standard that aligns with customer choice, the market, societal benefit, and American job growth."

Many others did not have anything to share about this issue. "We can't comment on that right now. Still too new to know anything about it," said a **Subaru spokesperson**. **General Motors' response** was similar, saying, "We don't have anything to share at this time."

**Toyota, Nissan, and Honda all deferred** to a statement made by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a collective made up of 42 automakers that has [previously petitioned President Trump about EV policy changes](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a63010777/automakers-petition-trump-ev-policy/). Honda said; "We do not have anything to share at this time. Please reach out to AFAI if you have additional questions."

John Bozzella, president and CEO, Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said:

"Today’s action is consistent with EPA's earlier announcement that it intended to repeal the endangerment finding and correct some of the unachievable emissions regulations enacted under the previous administration. I've said it before: Automotive emissions regulations finalized in the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace demand for EVs. The auto industry in America remains focused on preserving vehicle choice for consumers, keeping the industry competitive, and staying on a long-term path of emissions reductions and cleaner vehicles."  

This variety of responses proves that it's too early to make sweeping judgments about the effects that this policy change will have on the cars we drive. But we will keep an eye out for any resulting modifications that these automakers will make—or not make—to their U.S.-market vehicles in the future, in response to this current EPA administration's fight against stop-start technology.

Despite being raised on a steady diet of base-model Hondas and Toyotas—or perhaps because of it—Joey Capparella nonetheless cultivated an obsession for the automotive industry throughout his childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. He found a way to write about cars for the school newspaper during his college years at Rice University, which eventually led him to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for his first professional auto-writing gig at *Automobile Magazine*. He has been part of the *Car and Driver* team since 2016 and now lives in New York City.
