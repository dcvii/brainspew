Jacob Mchangama, Founder and Executive director at The Future of Free Speech and Research Professor at Vanderbilt University, speaking at the Censorship in the Sciences conference.

**Los Angeles, California, October 27:** A **[special issue](https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/volumes_issues/5/2)** of the *Journal of Controversial Ideas* published today explores the serious problem of censorship plaguing the sciences, from the classroom to the research lab to scientific journals. The **[special issue](https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/volumes_issues/5/2)** contains 9 peer-reviewed papers including:

- *From Worriers to Warriors: The Cultural Rise of Women* by **[Cory Clark](https://www.coryjclark.com/)**, Executive Director of the Adversarial Project at the University of Pennsylvania
- *Fire the Censors! It’s the Only Way to Restore Free Inquiry—Anyway, They’ve Been Firing Us for Years* by **[Robert Maranto](https://edre.uark.edu/people/faculty/uid/rmaranto/name/Robert-Maranto/)**, 21st Century Chair in Leadership at the Department of Education Reform at the University of Arkansas.
- *Silencing Science at MIT: MIT Shows that Cancel Culture Causes Self- Censorship at STEM Universities* by **[Wayne Stargardt](https://www.mitfreespeech.org/board_of_directors.php)**, President of the MIT Free Speech Alliance
- *With Friends Like These: On the Role of Presupposition in Pseudo-Defenses of Free Speech on Campus* by **[Mike Veber](https://philosophy-religion.ecu.edu/mike-veber/)**, Associate Professor of Philosophy at East Carolina University

The collection expands upon subjects discussed at the **[Censorship in the Sciences conference](https://dornsife.usc.edu/cesr/censorship-in-the-sciences-interdisciplinary-perspectives/)** held at the University of Southern California in January 2025. Over 100 academics gathered for three days to discuss what constitutes censorship, how this problem impacts scientific research and teaching, and how to combat its spread.

The collection also includes an introduction highlighting the themes discussed at the conference.

Contrary to the popular belief that censorship emanates mostly from authoritarian governments or religious mandates, this conference and follow-up publications, including this **[special issue](https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/volumes_issues/5/2)**, revealed that self-censorship and censorship attempts led by academics against their peers form the majority of “cancellations” occurring within the academy today.

Moreover, such censoring of science originates largely from the progressive left. This is unsurprising, given that the academy is now overwhelmingly dominated by faculty who self-identify as liberal or progressive.

Such intra-academic censorship is a serious problem, as the introduction to the special issue makes clear: “Academic jobs and promotions require letters of recommendation from colleagues. Grants necessitate approval from other academics, as do publications. Thus, control over the careers of scientists from within academia influences what subjects are researched and what scientific information is disseminated. In short, it is academics who are the gatekeepers of knowledge production and dissemination. They have the means to block publication, funding, and even employment of their peers.”

Censorship emerges through other avenues as well. At the conference and in his paper in this special issue **[Evan Morris](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/evan-morris/)**, Professor of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging and of Biomedical Engineering at Yale, explained how institutional review boards (IRBs) have strayed from their original respectable mission. Instead of protecting humans from amoral research, IRBs now exercise bureaucratic overreach that is derailing and delaying scientific experimentation.

“It is our hope that IRBs will adopt the ten principles of The Mudd Code put forth in our journal paper. Doing so will assure appropriate and timely review of research protocols. The IRB must balance risk reduction with potential benefits of biomedical research,” says Morris.

Shortly after the conference concluded, President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House began. Since then, concerns about government-led suppression of **[research](https://blog.ucs.org/jules-barbati-dajches/in-the-dark-trump-administration-continues-to-cancel-and-suppress-information/)** and teaching have increased dramatically. Many who attended this conference and who contributed to this issue **[anticipated such crackdowns](https://unsafescience.substack.com/p/we-tried-to-warn-you)**, however. Decades of self-censoring and progressive-led, intra-academic silencing campaigns created fertile ground for a right-wing backlash.

Thus, the subject of this collection is urgent. “Censorship of science on contested and controversial topics is a betrayal of scientists’ alleged commitment to truth and to the public trust, whether perpetrated by the government or other scientists,” says **[Lee Jussim](https://psych.rutgers.edu/people/chair-v-cs/faculty-profile/128-lee-jussim)**, Distinguished Professor at Rutgers New Brunswick’s Psychology Department.

Politicized attacks from both the left and the right, and encroaching campus “safetyism” and “well-being” culture, which shies away from uncomfortable ideas, must be curtailed to avoid the degradation of science. By identifying the problem and assessing its solutions, we become better equipped to fight the censorious, ensure reliable knowledge production, and restore public trust in science.

“Like jewel thieves, censors prefer to work in the dark and hope no one notices what’s missing. This special issue helps expose the quiet theft of knowledge,” says Cory Clark.
