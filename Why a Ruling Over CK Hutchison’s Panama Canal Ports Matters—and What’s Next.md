The high court said the license terms last granted to the Hong Kong firm in 2021 violate Panama’s constitution. The termination of Hutchison’s license to operate the ports of Balboa on the Pacific Coast and Cristóbal on the Atlantic side throws a wrench into the company’s [plans to sell more than 40 ports](https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/blackrock-strikes-23-billion-deal-for-ports-on-both-sides-of-panama-canal-d42a5b5e?mod=article_inline) globally to [BlackRock](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BLK) and Mediterranean Shipping Co. The two Panama container terminals were the crown jewels of the deal.

### What the ruling means for the Panama Canal

The ports managed by Hutchison aren’t part of the Panama Canal, and the court’s decision has no impact on the operation of the waterway.

The decades-old treaty that ceded U.S. control of the canal to Panama bans the involvement of foreign governments or state-run firms. At least 5% of global trade flows through the waterway, which is required to allow passage to vessels from all countries. The U.S. and China are top users.

The container terminals are located at the entrances of the waterway, a proximity that has long magnified their strategic sensitivity despite their formal separation from canal operations. Panama’s Port Authority, which supervises the terminals, said on Friday that it has implemented a transition plan to ensure the continuity of operations at the two ports. Once Hutchison’s license is formally revoked, it will hire APM Terminals, a unit of shipping firm [A.P. Moller-Maersk](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DK/XCSE/MAERSK.B?mod=article_inline), to temporarily manage the facilities.

The government will then open a bidding process with new license terms for the facilities, possibly separating the two ports to maximize value and market competition. BlackRock, MSC, APM Terminals and French rival CMA CGM have expressed interest, according to people familiar with the process. Last year Maersk bought the Panama Canal Railway Co., which operates a 47-mile line parallel to the waterway and moves containers between the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, further entrenching its logistics presence around the canal corridor.

Hutchison can’t appeal a Supreme Court ruling, but it can request clarifications that could delay the formal termination of its operating license. Hutchison said the decision undermined Panama’s business environment. A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry vowed to defend the country’s interests.

### The court ruling alters a $23 billion global ports deal

The BlackRock and MSC-led deal to buy Hutchison’s global ports portfolio [already looked to be in peril](https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/panama-ports-deal-hits-impasse-as-china-makes-new-demands-for-its-approval-ff741523?mod=article_inline), with China’s government threatening to block the transaction if state-run shipping company [Cosco wasn’t added as an equal partner](https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/panama-ports-deal-hits-impasse-as-china-makes-new-demands-for-its-approval-ff741523?mod=article_inline) with veto power.

The removal of the Panama container terminals from the transaction, however, could reduce Beijing’s leverage over the broader deal, potentially clearing a path to a sale of the remaining ports, which are less politically charged.

The billionaires behind MSC have already discussed [how to move forward](https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/shipping-tycoons-discuss-separating-panama-ports-from-hutchinson-deal-3c0438d6?mod=article_inline) with the bulk of the deal while the Panama case is resolved, The Wall Street Journal Journal reported last year. Hutchison’s global ports would also be a prized addition for BlackRock’s recently acquired infrastructure investing business.

Under the original deal, MSC was set to become the controlling owner of all the ports except for the two in Panama where BlackRock would have a controlling stake, the Journal reported. If the Panama assets are excluded, the parties will need to draw up new terms with Hutchison. A senior Chinese government official said Panama’s court ruling complicates the deal but doesn’t derail it.

### A diplomatic setback for China

The decision adds to pressure on China in the Western Hemisphere and suggests to other governments that they might re-examine their ties to the world’s second-biggest economy while Trump is in office.

China in recent years has emerged as the largest trading partner for most nations in Latin America and a source of funding for much-needed infrastructure, including ports and railways, investments that are now facing heightened political and security scrutiny. In Venezuela, for instance, Chinese oil producers gained ground by aligning politically with the regimes of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, but now have an uncertain future as the Trump administration asserts control over the sector after Maduro’s capture by the U.S.

The Panama ports appeared to provide Beijing little political or financial benefit. Unlike Chinese government-owned companies, Hutchison has long been run like a Western business where profits are paramount. Its ports operation in Panama was formerly led by a Briton. Hutchison’s controlling shareholder, 97-year-old Li Ka-shing, has sometimes had a testy relationship with Beijing, in particular since Xi Jinping became China’s leader in 2012.

Yet the ouster of the Hong Kong port operator illustrates how American pressure on a small nation can dislodge operations linked, fairly or not, to perceptions of Chinese state influence. The court decision follows Panama’s hasty exit last year from China’s Belt and Road initiative, Xi’s signature international expansion effort that has featured thousands of projects.

“China still has a strong incentive to treat this as a strategic test case and show it will defend Chinese-linked interests when they become targets,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China Program at Washington think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Singleton said the issue now becomes less about Hutchison and more about “stop the dominoes.”

### A Trump pledge

Trump said during his inauguration last year that he wanted to [take back control of the canal](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/china-panama-canal-development-what-it-means-7c5dc870?mod=article_inline), which the U.S. built in the early 20th century and handed over to Panama in late 1999.

While Panama strongly defended its control over the waterway, Trump’s threats accelerated a simmering dispute between Hutchison and the administration of Panama’s pro-American President José Raúl Mulino over contract terms.

Panama officials say that canal operations weren’t affected by China’s economic expansion, and its presence didn’t pose a security risk. But there was a growing perception that China was rapidly gaining a foothold and influence in the Central American nation.

“This is a win for America, Panama, and all of our allies who recognize the Canal’s importance to national security and the world economy,” said Michigan Republican John Moolenaar, chairman of a House Select Committee on China.

Panama’s [Supreme Court decision](https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/panamas-high-court-rules-against-hong-kong-firm-running-canal-ports-714c23c8?mod=article_inline) to void Hong Kong-based [CK Hutchison’s](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HK/XHKG/1) contract to operate two ports at either end of the Panama Canal is rippling through global shipping and geopolitics, complicating a $23 billion ports deal and sharpening U.S.-China competition in the Western Hemisphere.

The ruling forces Hutchison out of the strategically located terminals and deals a setback to Beijing’s regional influence. It also hands President Trump a symbolic win as his administration presses allies and partners to curb China’s footprint in critical infrastructure.
