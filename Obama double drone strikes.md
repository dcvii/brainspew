### We're tired of all the misinformation

If you're here, you probably are too. Most people just re-share whatever they see without checking. Factually exists for people who want a calm, non-partisan place to verify things. Support it to keep it independent — no ads, no political money.

You appear strongly to follow one of my favorite slogans: "We have to earn our wings every day." Like a friendly breeze under a bird's wings---tho I'm no gull (ie no gullible type, well, 99.9% of the time, min)--you've buoyed my hopes. For raising---with lotsa' help needed elsewhere---the reason/maelstrom ratio in at least American discourse re. public affairs. And re. scientific, commercial and bunk claims. Not at all always 3 mutually exclusive categories, either. Here's some monthly dough.

Not sure how you substantiate everything and how large of an organization factually is, but if you are what you say you are and report everything through unbiased eyes or opinions, you're to be commended. BTW, how do you fact check factually?

The news media in the US has shown a weakness I have never seen. I believe nothing I see or hear from the major 3 networks. I really turned to CNN and MSNBC years ago but have since lost it with them. I want to believe in Factually and its policy and will hopefully become a permanent member. Keep up the great work!

What a great find! I feared I had just been victim to a scam, but everything I searched for repeated the same misinformation. Finally I found your site, and my fears were confirmed. But it’s always better to know. Information equals power! Thank you!

**Executive summary**

Republican leaders have invoked Barack Obama’s drone campaign—often citing a figure of roughly 500–550 strikes—to defend or contextualize recent “double-tap” maritime strikes in the Caribbean; reporting and watchdog data show the Obama years did see far more drone strikes than under George W. Bush, with counts cited in the 400–550 range <sup><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5630177-caribbean-boat-strikes-controversy/">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-drone-strikes/">[3]</a></sup>. Critics say double‑tap attacks (secondary strikes that hit survivors or first responders) raise legal and ethical questions that scholars and human‑rights groups have flagged long before the current controversy <sup><a href="https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/flr/vol69/iss1/7/">[4]</a> <a href="https://harvardpolitics.com/obama-war-criminal/">[5]</a></sup>.

**1\. Republicans raise Obama as precedent — what they say and why**

House Speaker Mike Johnson explicitly referenced Obama‑era drone numbers when pressed about a Sept. 2 Caribbean “double‑tap” boat strike, saying “I think there were 550 drone strikes... and nobody ever questioned it,” using that history to argue the practice is not unprecedented <sup><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5630177-caribbean-boat-strikes-controversy/">[1]</a></sup>. Several conservative outlets and GOP officials have repeated that line to defend or normalize recent strikes while drawing a political contrast with Democratic criticism <sup><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/republicans-obama-drone-strikes">[6]</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/johnson-points-obama-era-drone-precedent-congress-probes-deadly-caribbean-strike">[7]</a></sup>.

**2\. How many Obama‑era strikes? The reporting and datasets**

Independent reporters and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism document that strikes surged under Obama compared with Bush; the Bureau’s accounting and other analyses put covert strikes in the hundreds—figures commonly cited include roughly 473–542 strikes in areas of active hostilities and other tallies approaching 495 or more in some country‑specific counts <sup><a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-drone-strikes/">[3]</a></sup>. Different counts reflect differences in definition (covert vs. declared strikes; geographic scope) and disclosure practices <sup><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-drone-strikes/">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush">[2]</a></sup>.

**3\. What “double‑tap” means and why it matters legally**

Academics and rights advocates define a double‑tap as an initial strike followed by a secondary strike after responders arrive—often a five‑to‑20 minute window—intended to catch survivors or rescuers; legal scholars argue such patterns risk violating protections for civilians, the wounded, and first responders under Common Article 3 and related law <sup><a href="https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/flr/vol69/iss1/7/">[4]</a></sup>. Commentary and campus publications have used the double‑tap practice to argue that some Obama‑era strikes warrant investigation for potential violations of international humanitarian law <sup><a href="https://harvardpolitics.com/obama-war-criminal/">[5]</a> <a href="https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/flr/vol69/iss1/7/">[4]</a></sup>.

**4\. Media coverage and political framing are contested**

Left‑leaning outlets and progressive commentators accuse Republicans of selective outrage—invoking Obama’s strikes rhetorically while defending similar or more recent actions by the Trump administration—whereas conservative outlets emphasize continuity to undercut accusations of illegality or exceptionalism <sup><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/republicans-obama-drone-strikes">[6]</a> <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/gop-strikes/">[8]</a></sup>. Reporters note that invoking Obama’s record is tactically aimed at blunting congressional scrutiny of the most recent maritime strikes <sup><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/republicans-obama-drone-strikes">[6]</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5630177-caribbean-boat-strikes-controversy/">[1]</a></sup>.

**5\. Differences between past drone campaigns and recent maritime strikes**

Analysts say maritime boat strikes are legally and operationally distinct from the decades‑long counterterror drone campaigns in the Middle East and Africa: policymakers have labeled alleged traffickers “narcoterrorists,” but several experts stress there has been no analogous attack on the U.S. homeland or UN Security Council authorization to justify lethal force at sea in the same way prior counter‑terror operations were framed <sup><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/central-america-caribbean/america-unbound-caribbean">[9]</a></sup>. That distinction is central to critics who argue prior legal rationales do not automatically license the current maritime campaign <sup><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/central-america-caribbean/america-unbound-caribbean">[9]</a></sup>.

**6\. Accountability, transparency and the evidence gap**

Different datasets and disclosures mean the exact tally and civilian casualty numbers from Obama’s strikes have long been disputed; Snopes and investigative bureaus map varying totals and note changes in reporting practices over time <sup><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-drone-strikes/">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush">[2]</a></sup>. Available sources do not mention comprehensive, declassified internal legal memos resolving whether specific double‑tap strikes met the criminal standard under international law; scholars have urged formal investigations <sup><a href="https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/flr/vol69/iss1/7/">[4]</a> <a href="https://harvardpolitics.com/obama-war-criminal/">[5]</a></sup>.

**7\. What to watch next**

Congressional oversight hearings into the Caribbean strike and the administration’s legal rationale are underway or anticipated; expect lawmakers to press on whether past precedents were legally analogous and whether rules of engagement for maritime strikes differ from prior drone operations <sup><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5630177-caribbean-boat-strikes-controversy/">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/johnson-points-obama-era-drone-precedent-congress-probes-deadly-caribbean-strike">[7]</a></sup>. Advocacy groups and academic legal notes suggest scrutiny will hinge on casualty documentation and whether follow‑up strikes intentionally targeted rescuers—a fact pattern that determines both public outrage and potential legal liability <sup><a href="https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/flr/vol69/iss1/7/">[4]</a> <a href="https://harvardpolitics.com/obama-war-criminal/">[5]</a></sup>.

Limitations: This analysis draws only on the supplied reporting, legal scholarship and fact‑checks; discrepancies in strike counts reflect differing definitions and disclosure practices reported in those sources <sup><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-drone-strikes/">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush">[2]</a></sup>.
