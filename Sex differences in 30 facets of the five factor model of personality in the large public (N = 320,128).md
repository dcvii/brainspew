## Highlights

- •
	We studied the sex gap in 30 facet traits (IPIP-NEO) in a large US sample (*N*  = 320,128).
- •
	Women scored higher (*d*  > 0.50) in Anxiety, Vulnerability, Openness to Emotions, , and Sympathy.
- •
	Men only scored higher (*d*  > 0.20) in Excitement-seeking and Openness to Intellect.

## Psychological sex differences

One of the most informative meta-analyses on psychological differences between sexes encompasses an impressive 100 meta-analyses, and concludes that the overall difference between sexes is small (Cohen's *d*  = 0.21) (Zell, Teeter, & Zell, 2015). An effect size of 0.2 standard deviations (*d*) would translate into approximately 58% of one sex having a higher score than the mean of the other (Cohen, 1992; See [http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend) for calculations). Nevertheless, large apparent

## Sex differences in personality traits

Personality traits are defined as consistencies in affect, thinking, and behavior that tend to be stable across situations and time-spans, developing predictably throughout life (Briley & Tucker-drob, 2014). The most used conceptualization is today the Five Factor Model (FFM) (McCrae, 2010). This model organizes personality into five trait factor domains (N = Neuroticism, E = Extraversion, O = Openness, A = Agreeableness, and C = Conscientiousness), which in turn are composed by a number of

## The present study

In the current study, the main objective was to update and report on scope and size of sex differences in 30 personality facets in a large public sample, using a public domain version of the Five Factor Model (IPIP-NEO-120). Based on existing recommendations, effects around *d* ~0.40 (equivalent to *r* ~0.20) would be considered notable (Gignac & Szodorai, 2016). The resulting discussion could facilitate our continued understanding as researchers and practitioners (see Hyde, 2014).

## Sample and procedure

We used a US sample (*N*  = 320,128) surveyed online on five personality trait domains and 30 specific facet traits. The respondents were 19–69 year old, which is the time-frame when traits are known to be stable, and show predictable change throughout age-spans (Briley & Tucker-drob, 2014). The sample consisted of 40% male (*N*  = 127,695) and 60% female (*N*  = 192,433), with an average age of 28.13 years (*SD*  = 10.14). The internet site drew visitors from all walks of life who could have reached the

## Results

Table 1 summarizes sex differences in the five trait domains as well as 30 specific trait facets, using the effect size of Cohen's *d* (mean differences in standard units). Women technically scored higher in all five trait domains; but only notably so in Agreeableness (*d*  = 0.58) and Neuroticism (*d*  = 0.40). Trait facets Anxiety (N1), Vulnerability (N6), Emotionality (O3), Altruism (A3), and Sympathy (A6) were large (*d*  > 0.50). Men showed markedly (*d*  > 0.20) higher scores only in Excitement-seeking

## Discussion

The current study showed that almost 50% of the specific FFM personality trait facets showed above small effects, and almost 25% above medium effects in sex differences. The most notable difference was seen in the trait domains Neuroticism and Agreeableness. Some specific facets, such as Anxiety (N1) and Sympathy (A6), reported mean effects of over *d* ~ 0.50 (Table 1). Interestingly, Neuroticism was, unlike Agreeableness, not uniformly different between sexes across the age-spans, with the

## Concluding thoughts

Particularly two trait domains seem to be of driving interest when it comes to sex differences; Neuroticism and Agreeableness. From a more general scientific viewpoint, it is critical to constantly reaffirm and extend foundations of psychology, especially in the wide-reaching wake of the recognized replication crisis within psychology (Anderson et al., 2016). This study has attempted to heed this by confirming and expounding on the scope and size of sex differences in personality with one of

	However, they may do so in two opposing directions. On the one hand, higher rates of female Neuroticism in general (Lehmann et al., 2012; Lippa, 2010a; Schmitt et al., 2008) and anxiety specifically (Costa et al., 2001; Kajonius & Johnson, 2018) can cause women to be more concerned about their online privacy and employ more behavioral actions to ensure their privacy. On the other hand, higher rates of female Agreeableness and Extraversion can cause women to self-disclose more than males, in an attempt to foster social interaction.
