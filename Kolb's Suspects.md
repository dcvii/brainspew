Who are the major criminals imugned by Kolb's America At Night?

Major Criminals Impugned in Larry J. Kolb's America at Night Larry J. Kolb's 2007 book America at Night: The True Story of Two Rogue CIA Operatives, Homeland Security Failures, Dirty Money, and a Plot to Steal the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election centers on Kolb's investigation into white-collar criminals with deep ties to intelligence agencies, the Republican Party, and international crime networks. As a former CIA operative, Kolb uncovers their involvement in financial scams, money laundering, smuggling Russian oligarchs into the U.S., and a scheme to fabricate Al Qaeda links to John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign to sabotage it. The narrative impugns these figures for corruption, fraud, and undermining U.S. security and democracy, often with implied complicity from high-level political enablers like Karl Rove and figures connected to George H.W. Bush.The primary criminals profiled are two master con men, portrayed as central antagonists. Secondary figures and networks are mentioned but receive less focus. Below is a summary table of the major ones impugned, based on the book's key allegations (drawn from reviews, summaries, and Kolb's own accounts):

| Name |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

Additional Notes
- Secondary Networks Impugned: The book broadly criticizes enablers like rogue CIA elements (e.g., those tied to Bill Casey and George H.W. Bush, portrayed as having "gone bad"), Russian mafia figures (e.g., Semion Mogilevich), and political operatives (e.g., Karl Rove, accused of dirty tricks). It also questions the efficacy of the drug war and implicates broader Republican "dirty tricks" culture.
- Book's Tone and Evidence: Kolb's account is thriller-like, backed by footnotes, named sources, and public records, but some reviewers note its cynical, anti-Republican slant and reliance on his prior memoir Overworld. It's not a legal indictment but a journalistic exposé based on Kolb's DHS-recruited investigation.
- Context: Published amid post-9/11 scrutiny of intelligence failures, the book argues these criminals exploited systemic gaps to threaten national security and elections.
For deeper details, I recommend reading the book or Kolb's Wikipedia page for biographical context.
