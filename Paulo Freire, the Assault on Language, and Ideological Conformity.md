Paulo Freire, the Brazilian educator and philosopher, is one of the most cited educational theorists taught in schools of education in the United States. As of the date of publication of this article, Google Scholar showed Freire had [583,712 citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IdMf1V7YL6MC&hl=en) over all time, and 194,282 since 2020. For comparison, John Dewey (1859-1952), the founder of American progressive education, has only [452,210 citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dD5DTREAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) all time.[1](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/paulo-freire-the-assault-on-language?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=321514&post_id=157496501&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-1-157496501)

Freire’s most famous work -- *[Pedagogy of the Oppressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed)* (1968) -- is considered the foundational text of *critical pedagogy* and is canon in US schools of education. ***[Critical pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_pedagogy)*** in turn is the educational philosophy and social movement that applies *Critical Theory* to the broader field of education.

Freire profoundly shapes U.S. pre-college teacher education, often unbeknownst to teachers.

Freire’s philosophy of education elucidated in *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* was that learning should be a tool for liberation and social transformation, not merely the transmission of information from teachers to passive students, what he called the “banking model” of education. Students are supposed to actively engage with knowledge through *critical* dialogue and reflect about their lived experience and social condition.

Core to Freire’s model of critical pedagogy is the concept of *conscientization* (*conscientizaçao* in Portugese) — that students are supposed to develop a *critical consciousness*, an awareness of social, political, and economic contradictions while gaining the tools to take action (called *praxis*) against oppressive elements of society. He emphasized that education is inherently political and should empower marginalized groups to understand and transform their circumstances, rather than simply adapt to them. Freire’s approach positions teachers and students as co-equals who work together to investigate meaningful problems, connect learning to social context, and develop critical thinking skills that can lead to concrete action for social change.

If this philosophy sounds radical and Marxist in its assumption that the world consists of oppressors and the oppressed, it’s because it is. Critical pedagogy assumes a Marxist framework in analyzing how society functions. In fact, Freire drew heavily from Marx’s works in his own theories. *Conscientization* is the application to education of Marx’s class consciousness, blended with Christian liberation theology.

A central theme in Freire’s ideas on education is what he called “the practice of freedom.”[2](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/paulo-freire-the-assault-on-language?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=321514&post_id=157496501&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-2-157496501) He saw education as a tool for liberation to empower learners, particularly those who suffered from class and colonial oppression, to question and transform the societal structures that limited their freedom. Note, however, that Freire did not advocate for individual liberty, rather he advocated for *collective* liberation from oppressive systems.

In a similar manner, Freire uses the word ‘*democracy*’ throughout his writings, but critiqued the classical liberal definition and called for a new kind of democracy where the oppressed classes liberated themselves by overthrowing existing power structures.

Freire’s redefinition of terms like ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy’ mirrors broader ideological trends, a tactic George Orwell famously critiqued. Orwell demonstrated through his dystopian fiction that collectivist and totalitarian regimes and those instrumental in its design deliberately redefined words to suit ideological ends and control the populace.[3](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/paulo-freire-the-assault-on-language?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=321514&post_id=157496501&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-3-157496501)

The examples from the Soviet Union that Orwell observed, and in totalitarian regimes after his death, that inspired his concept of ***newspeak*** in his novel *1984* illustrate the manipulation of language to exert control of people. The Soviets infamously referred to the Gulag system of forced labor camps as “rehabilitation through labor.” Mass executions and starvation in the collectivization period of the USSR (i.e. 1928-1933) were euphemistically called “liquidation.”

Language was also manipulated by the Soviets and their satellite states to place a veneer of democratic legitimacy on single-party authoritarian rule in the eyes of the world community. The *German Democratic Republic* (i.e. the former East Germany), the *Democratic Republic of Korea* (i.e. North Korea), and the *People’s Republic of China* were neither republics, nor democratic.

The abuse of language by totalitarian regimes reached its zenith in the tragic history of modern Cambodia. Pol Pot and his subordinates in the Khmer Rouge, inspired by the Soviet success with gulags, took political repression and newspeak to a new level during their genocidal rule of Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. The Khmer Rouge emptied entire cities into the countryside, a process they called “liberation,” where those who were not outright executed were “re-educated” to become productive agrarian workers. Torture and indoctrination were *de rigeur* in the “re-education” camps.

Urban dwellers forcibly moved to the countryside were derisively called “New People,” while the rural peasants and farmers who predated the revolution were called “Base People.” Following the practice of other communist countries from the era, Cambodia renamed itself *Democratic Kampuchea*.

The magnitude of depravity inflicted upon the people of Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge is lost on Gen Z in their naive embrace of socialism and other collectivist solutions to perceived societal problems. As much as one-fourth of all Cambodians — 2 million of a population of 7.8 million — were ruthlessly killed by their own government during the communist revolution in Cambodia in a mere four years.[4](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/paulo-freire-the-assault-on-language?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=321514&post_id=157496501&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-4-157496501) When the magnitude of the slaughter became too big to hide, the Khmer Rouge used the slogan “To Keep You Is No Benefit, To Destroy You Is No Loss” on its own people to justify the mass killings.[5](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/paulo-freire-the-assault-on-language?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=321514&post_id=157496501&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-5-157496501) A more representative example of doublethink would be difficult to find. So complete was Pol Pot’s scheme to control the thoughts of the populace that upon taking power, he reset the calendar to “Year Zero,” a message to all that Cambodian society was being reset to an agrarian utopia thereby erasing history, current culture and modernity.

Contrary to classical liberal values of freedom of speech, open inquiry, and diversity of thought, Freire’s concept of ‘*conscientization’* and ‘practice of freedom’ valued collective liberation through *praxis* (reflection followed by action) as the solution to current systems of oppression. That *praxis* can lead to extreme measures including violence and revolution to achieve societal transformation was probably expected by Freire, though he never explicitly called for violence in *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*. Freire was likely influenced by Frantz Fanon’s *[The Wretched of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wretched_of_the_Earth)* (1961), which advocated for third world native populations to overthrow their colonial rulers.

Fanon argued that colonialism is inherently violent and dehumanizing, and perpetuates itself through economic exploitation, racial hierarchy and cultural erasure. Therefore he said that violence was justified by native peoples to overthrow their colonial rulers and achieve ‘true liberation.’ He did not just passively advocate for violent revolution, he devoted a whole chapter to it, titled “On Violence” in *The Wretched of the Earth* and said that violence was inevitable, cleansing and unifying, “At the level of individuals, violence is a cleansing force. It frees the native from his inferiority complex and from his despair and inaction; it makes him fearless and restores his self-respect.”[6](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/paulo-freire-the-assault-on-language?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=321514&post_id=157496501&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-6-157496501)

That Freire became one of the most influential educational theorists in American schools of education is not accidental. Disciples of Freire, including Henry Giroux and Isaac Gottesman, were key to the spread of his ideas in the West, particularly the United States.[7](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/paulo-freire-the-assault-on-language?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=321514&post_id=157496501&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-7-157496501)

The success of the spread of Freire’s ideas in American schools of education owes partly to the successful use of seemingly benign, but manipulated language. Perhaps most misunderstood among words in Freire’s lexicon is *critical*. I have sat through numerous public school curriculum meetings and read countless articles where professional educators promote *critical pedagogy* under the misbegotten notion that *critical* in a social justice context means critical thinking. It does not.

As but one example, in my kids’ public school district in California while [implementing a new Ethnic Studies mandate from the state](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/critical-pedagogy-breaches-the-wall), the local high school modified the core 9th grade English Language Arts (ELA) course to read ‘prominent’ works of literature “through different critical lenses.” The so-called ‘prominent’ works of literature read in the class replaced classic literary works such as Shakespeare’s *Othello*, Homer’s *The Iliad*, and Sophocles’ *Antigone.* The inferior works that replaced them — *The House on Mango Street* by Sandra Cisneros, *Crying in the H Mart* by Michelle Zauner, and *A Raisin in the Sun* by Lorraine Hansberry — were chosen because of the racial identity of the authors more-so than the importance the ideas advanced or the quality of their writing. School staff and board members blithely welcomed the change, thinking analysis through a critical lens and the mention of critical thinking were desirable and sufficient.

Socratic *critical thinking* in the classical sense as rooted in Socrates, Aristotle and the Enlightenment tradition focuses on reason, logic, and open-ended questioning to seek objective truth. Critical thinking in critical pedagogy as espoused by Freire and his proponents views knowledge as a social construct that it is shaped by power dynamics rather than objective reality. *Critical theory* as a field of analysis is Marxist in orientation (though it was a critique of why Marxism was failing in practice) and was developed by postmodernists in the [Frankfurt School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School).[8](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/paulo-freire-the-assault-on-language?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=321514&post_id=157496501&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-8-157496501)

The near-term goal of critical thinking from a postmodernist framework is to “unveil” oppression, assuming power structures inherently favor capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy. The end-goal of critical thinking in the critical pedagogy sense is the pre-determined political goal of dismantling oppressive systems wherever they exist, as opposed to fostering genuine intellectual inquiry.

Critical thinking in the classical sense and critical thinking in the critical pedagogy sense have profound differences in how they affect education. Socratic critical thinking encourages students to question everything with the end goal of finding the truth, even if it challenges personal or popular beliefs. Critical pedagogy à la Freire encourages student questioning too, but only within a specific ideological framework that assumes oppression is the root of all societal problems. Critical pedagogy seeks ideological alignment with liberation movements and, like its postmodernist roots, rejects objective truth and objective reasoning.

Though the tide of the critical social justice movement, and *Diversity, Equity and Inclusion* (DEI) programs in particular, is receding across present-day America, its effects are far reaching and will be difficult to root out as its defenders attempt to hide DEI under more benign names like “community care,” “belonging” and “leadership and inclusion.”

DEI rebranding efforts are deliberate and meant to slow its recession in certain institutions. This is a rearguard action meant to avoid the outright elimination of DEI offices and initiatives as has occurred in large corporations like Walmart, Meta, and Boeing, as well as many Federal agencies and the military services.

Note that “inclusion” remains in the rebranded DEI programs of some institutions. This reflects the view held by some that *inclusion* is a less divisive term than *equity* and *diversity*, and a noble goal to be pursued at any cost. Inclusion is far from benign.

*Inclusion* is perhaps the most pernicious in the DEI triumvirate because the word in its critical social justice usage is so Orwellian. Inclusion actually means exclusion when understood in its designed intent.

*Inclusion* in the critical pedagogy and critical theory context does not mean including everyone. Instead it has been redefined to focus exclusively on *historically marginalized groups*, deliberately at the expense of viewpoint diversity, free speech, and individual merit. Worse still, it allows for silencing individuals and groups who are perceived to have hegemony over others. If the mere presence of dominant groups makes individuals of marginalized identities feel ‘unsafe’ or ‘unwelcome,’ the dominant group can be silenced or excluded. Examples of this Orwellian doublethink include speech codes and bias response teams on college campuses, school curricula and programs that center specific racial or gender identities while actively discouraging or ignoring alternative viewpoints, hostile corporate trainings, and exclusive ‘safe spaces’ for only certain minority groups.

If inclusion means all voices are welcome, then why are dissenting voices silenced?

If [diversity is our greatest strength](https://sugisorensen.substack.com/p/diversity-is-not-our-greatest-strength), they why is ideological diversity seen as a threat?

While Freire presented his theory as empowering students to think critically about their position in society, the reality is that educational institutions that adopt his approach focus on pushing a specific worldview — often aligned with collectivism, identity politics, and activism-driven pedagogy. Instead of encouraging diverse perspectives, students are more often than not taught *what* to think rather than *how* to think.

The healthy functioning of a democratic society depends upon non-violent, civil discourse in order to survive. Classical liberalism values free speech, open debate, and a marketplace of ideas. However, many students today, having been educated in schools taught by teachers inculcated in critical pedagogy, increasingly view dissenting opinions as forms of “harm” or “violence.” This leads to calls for censorship, de-platforming, and even physical intimidation of those who challenge the prevailing narrative.

Freire’s emphasis on *praxis* can lead to a justification of extreme measures to achieve political goals. We see this in the normalization of cancel culture, suppression of dissenting views, and even street protests that escalate into violence, all under the guise of fighting “oppression.” Instead of producing independent thinkers, Freirean-inspired education has often created rigid ideological activists. If continued unabated, the present course will see increased hostility towards classical liberal values such as free speech, private property and individual rights, and more concerningly, the rise of an activist class that prioritizes ideological purity over genuine democratic debate. Some have asserted that we have already reached that point.
