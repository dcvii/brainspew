Kamala Harris speaks at the annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign on October 29, 2022. _(Paul Morigi/Getty Images)_

> “And I would say, ‘Well, what is the power of these groups — like, what is their leverage on you?’ And there was never an answer,” - [Ezra Klein](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/opinion/obama-ezra-klein-podcast-michael-lind.html) on how woke interest groups control the Democrats.

It was a trivial incident in the grand scheme of things. At one point in the campaign, Kamala Harris had to decide whether to go on Joe Rogan — a show with 18 million subscribers on YouTube alone. Here’s why she didn’t: “There was a backlash with some of our progressive staff that didn’t want her to be on it, and how there would be a backlash,” Jennifer Palmieri, an aide to Doug Emhoff, [explained](https://www.ft.com/content/9292db59-8291-4507-8d86-f8d4788da467). (Palmieri later implausibly tried to walk that back, citing a scheduling conflict.)

There you have the core dynamic that has crippled the Democrats for the last decade. A tiny faction of usually young, well-educated, very-online social justice activists have been using the classic campus tactics of the far left to capture the interest groups and nonprofits that dominate Democratic policy-making. The weapon the activists use: classic internal accusations of racism/sexism/transphobia, empowered by staff revolts, Twitter mobs, and other social media. And then the Democrats, believing these groups represent actual public opinion, especially among minorities, take positions far outside the mainstream with scarcely any public debate — and become paralyzed when challenged.

The groups do not represent anyone but the clique of well-financed, super-rich donors and activists caught up in the elite cult of social justice. The LatinX groups don’t represent most Latinos (that is now blindingly obvious); BLM hostility to the police is a distortion of far more nuanced views among African-Americans; the transqueer groups have very different — and far more radical — priorities than most normie gay men and lesbians, who just want to live their lives in peace. And yet all these groups have long nailed Democratic elites to the cross of left-extremism, never more fatally than this year.

And _obviously_ this is partly why Trump won: Harris had no way to distance herself from the crazies. I’m not apologizing for airing the trans issue as Exhibit A in this respect — because I was proven right in this election to an extent even I didn’t fully grok. Not only did Trump’s ads on the trans issue shift viewers [2.7 percent toward Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html) in the states they ran in (more than his margin of victory), the issue was particularly potent for swing voters.

When swing voters were given [25 possible reasons](https://x.com/wesyang/status/1855150203633881587) for why they didn’t vote for Harris, the statement that she “focused more on cultural issues like transgender issues than helping the middle class” was the _most-cited_ reason by those who chose Trump. Number One. I repeat: more swing voters voted for Trump on that issue than on inflation or immigration. In a focus group conducted by the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/13/opinion/focusgroup-young-undecided-voters.html), a 25-year-old woman in DC said:

> I shocked myself and voted for Trump. No one tell my family. … I think I became radicalized on the men and women’s sports issue. The ad that said, “Kamala represents they/them. Trump represents you,” that was so compelling. While Trump is deranged, he represented normalcy somehow to me.

If that’s a Gen Z woman in DC, imagine the impact in a swing state. Now look at the Democrats’ public response to this self-inflicted wound. One blue-state congressman, Seth Moulton, tried to learn a lesson after Election Day. While he reiterated his support for trans civil rights in general, he drew a line at biological boys competing with girls in high school sports:

> I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat, I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.

Moulton’s view is shared by [69 percent](https://news.gallup.com/poll/507023/say-birth-gender-dictate-sports-participation.aspx) of the public, and a slight 48-47 majority of Democrats. There are very few issues with public support as broad and bipartisan as this. But as soon as he opened his mouth, the backlash was [instant and extreme](https://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/2024/11/13/editorial-moulton-uproar-shows-tone-deaf-dems-reality-deficit/):

> The Massachusetts Democratic Party said Moulton’s comments “do not represent the broad view of our party.” In Moulton’s hometown, Salem City Councilor Kyle Davis called on Moulton to resign, and state Rep. Manny Cruz of Salem said he was “deeply disappointed in my congressman who has been doubling down on his transphobic views.” ... Moulton’s campaign manager and director of his “Serve America’’ political committee, resigned.

Young Democrats of America [branded him](https://x.com/youngdems/status/1855740436671042039) a “coward” and insisted, “Trans rights are not up for debate.” In a classic campus tactic, a group of former Moulton staffers and interns wrote an open letter demanding he apologize to “the LGBTQ+ community.” Moulton [didn’t cave](https://x.com/benryanwriter/status/1856157008048656833):

> The backlash has only served to reinforce my original point. … So let’s stop cancelling and start having these important conversations.

One thing you notice about the SJW pushback: they never actually rebut any of the concerns about fairness in sports, which is the nub of the issue. They don’t rebut it, because they cannot rebut it, even though some have tried. Nor do they ever engage with the fast-changing facts and research on “gender-affirming care,” i.e. sex reassignment for children. In fact, they do all they can to suppress journalism and hound reporters because this subject has been determined “not up for debate.”

And so transness is sacralized, made inviolable, and any weighing of the evidence is regarded not as part of a reasonable debate but as a kind of blasphemy. Check out the [CNN panel](https://x.com/ClayTravis/status/1855111691295404351) when the question of biological boys competing with girls in sports came up. Instantly, one panelist cried foul:

> They’re not boys! I’m not going to listen to transphobia at this table!

Even to raise a position backed by a massive majority is deemed bigotry on CNN.

Or think of two high priests of wokeness, John Oliver and Jon Stewart. I’ve covered their willful disinformation [before](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-tory-present-is-the-gops-future?open=false#%C2%A7the-oliver-and-stewart-method). But they still both cling to the idea that the science is settled on transing children (it sure isn’t), and mock all skeptics as bigots (most European governments would disagree). That CNN panelist dismissed voters’ concerns over trans athletes — “a tiny, tiny sliver of the population” — as if the scale of the issue resolved the essence of it — or its political potency. And Oliver long ago dismissed any debate about fairness in sports: “But even if there were more [biological boys competing against girls], discriminating against them would still obviously be wrong.” Obviously. Not a difficult trade-off. No trade-off at all. And no argument. (It reminds me of the most nauseating political sign of the campaign: “Kamala. Obviously.” If that didn’t make you want to vote for Trump, what would?)

In Stewart’s post-election take [this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKBJoj4XyFc), he simply insisted that the Dems had not run on woke issues, and so the trans issue couldn’t be blamed. But, of course, the Trump campaign _made_ the Dems run on the trans issue — by highlighting their actual positions in a devastating ad campaign. And all Harris could say in response was that the issue was “quite remote” and she was merely following the law. She ran no ads to counter the attack — because she neither wanted to lose votes by backing taxpayer-funded sex changes for illegal aliens and inmates, nor alienate the trans activists who control her party. The worst of all possible worlds.

It’s encouraging that Ezra Klein cops to this dynamic and had Dish-fave Michael Lind on his [podcast this week](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/opinion/obama-ezra-klein-podcast-michael-lind.html) to explore it some more. Here’s Mike on how the groups distort everything:

> Lind’s law of nonprofit advocacy [is]: You go as far as the voters support your position, and then you go beyond the border into further territory where the next position is unpopular ... And this is a deliberate strategic move, because if you just are advocating for what everybody believes anyway, then you’ve won. Nobody’s going to write you a check.
> 
> But if you go 10 or 20 or 30 percent further, into the controversial realm, then you will be attacked. And in the case of progressive nonprofits, you’re being attacked by the right, which is what you want. And you can say, “We’re being attacked for this.” And then you can link it to your previous gains by saying, “They don’t only oppose this bridgehead in enemy territory, but they want to roll back everything we’ve done in the last hundred years.”

This is precisely what has happened with trans rights. Thanks to _Bostock_ (2020), transgender people have full civil rights under the 1964 Act; and large majorities of Americans [oppose trans discrimination](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/). It doesn’t get any better for a minority than that. So a few years ago, this topic seemed settled.

Then the advocates of critical gender and queer theory captured the gay groups and pushed “10 or 20 or 30 percent further,” as Mike put it. The groups decreed that “affirmation-only” fast-track medical transing of pubescent children and allowing biological men in women’s sports and showers were _non-negotiable_ civil rights. They then used the usual bullying tactics to get their way. Declaring that “no compromise” was possible, Biden thereby ended all distinctions between boys and girls in schools and colleges by executive order on his [first day in office](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/bidens-culture-war-aggression-fc4). Authoritarian much?

Harris’ backing of federally funded sex-change operations for incarcerated illegal aliens — what sounded at first blush like an invented parody of woke nuttiness — was the result of an ACLU questionnaire. That’s how it works. The groups are captured by radicals (in this case by the extremist lawyer, Chase Strangio), just as our campuses have been. The groups get the pols on the record by threatening to call them bigots if they don’t. The pols then run for election with a huge woke albatross around their neck — on an issue they haven’t even had a real debate about. The activists subsequently bully the media to prevent any airing of the debate.

To buttress their authoritah, the transqueer activists then portray themselves as merely the latest people to be “on the right side of history” and equate their struggle to sterilize children and end women’s sports with, say, marriage equality. And no one in the gay rights movement — apart from, ahem, a few writers already exiled from legacy media — demurs. But of course, medical experiments on children and ending women’s sports have nothing to do with a civil right like the right to marry. They’re social and cultural _policy_ revolutions rooted in [neo-Marxist postmodernism](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-queers-versus-the-homosexuals-cfd).

And unlike marriage rights — when we patiently advocated for our position and, in 20 years, turned public opinion around from 2-1 against to 2-1 in favor — the transqueers, despite their hyperventilating, have been losing ground. In May 2021, 62 percent of Americans opposed biological boys competing with girls in sports; by 2023, that went up to 69 percent. Why? Not because of transphobia, but because it’s bleeding obvious to any sane, breathing human who has ever lived on planet earth that males are stronger and faster than females — on average, and _especially so_ in competitive sports. You can yell and scream at people all you want, but you can’t force them to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears, as Orwell put it. Nor of course, should you.

The extremist groups don’t even represent most trans people, especially those over the age of 30. Many (including [Brianna Wu](https://www.thefp.com/p/brianna-wu-bari-weiss-gamergate-progressive-antisemitism-honestly) and [Tara Ella](https://taraella.substack.com/p/how-trans-people-can-survive-under)) are [fed up](https://x.com/NickyFrank30/status/1855378350812139552):

> One said progressive activists are like “locusts” who move from one cause to the other, “exploiting marginalized groups and using them to spark unwinnable fights and leaving them in a worst place than before.” Another said trans people feel like the Left’s “pikemen” saying “we were placed in the front lines by people who have nothing to lose if the battle goes badly.” She added “we just wanted basic rights and instead we lectured people about pronouns.”

We all live on campus now, as I [once wrote](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/02/we-all-live-on-campus-now.html). In a truly Karmic development, that’s now especially true for the Democrats. Until someone in that party develops an ability to say no to the ideologically-captured groups, they will keep losing — and deserve to keep losing.

Defend trans rights for adults: absolutely. Do so without apology. But don’t deny biological and human reality. And don’t impose your fanaticism on vulnerable _children_. That’s not hard, is it? But for the Democratic Party, it appears permanently impossible. Advantage: Trump. Until someone in the Democratic leadership finally has the balls to say no to the groups. Whoever does has a bright political future.

Anderson doesn’t need an introduction, but he’s a broadcast journalist and commentator who has anchored _Anderson Cooper 360°_ for more than two decades. He’s also a correspondent for _60 Minutes_ and the host of a remarkable podcast centered on grief, “All There Is.” He invited me on the pod after the death of my mother this summer, and this Dishcast episode is the extended version of our conversation, which covers my experience of the AIDS crisis and the deaths of my parents and my beagle, Bowie.

**Listen to the episode [here](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/anderson-cooper-and-me-on-grief)**. There you can find three clips of our convo — on Anderson losing his brother to suicide, how he coped by seeking out warzones, and coming out of the closet on the Dish. That link also takes you to commentary on last week’s election post-mortem with Damon Linker, along with reader reflections on the Trump win.

### Money Quotes For The Week

“[Senate confirmation for Cabinet picks] is an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters. … He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward, for the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had no other merit than … being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure,” - [Alexander Hamilton](https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/a-terrible-anti-constitutional-scheme-of-recess-appointments/).

“I would describe it as God-tier level trolling to just trigger a full-on China Syndrome to own the libs in perpetuity,” - [John Fetterman](https://x.com/AutismCapital/status/1856865798205403458) on Trump’s new Cabinet picks.

“I will never stop marveling at people on the left acting outraged that someone would hire a convicted felon,” - [Noam Blum](https://x.com/neontaster/status/1855282111302820283).

“Imagine telling a Democrat in 2012 that in a dozen years, the GOP would win 47% of Latino Zoomers while running on a platform that calls for mass deportations,” - [Christian Heiens](https://x.com/christianheiens/status/1855862701651599420).

“Watching a bunch of clueless establishment Democrats on television trying to figure out what went wrong in the election is hilarious. Because the correct answer is them,” - [Cenk Uygur](https://x.com/cenkuygur/status/1855670683382022536).

“People on TV asking that you push away your real-life family is final-stage mass psychopathy” - [Walter Kirn](https://x.com/walterkirn/status/1855325031544283393) on Yale psychiatrist Amanda Calhoun’s advice on MSNBC.

“Whatever else you think of him, Donald Trump is *openly pro-SSM.* He even hosted a gay wedding at his house. I’m not asking liberal or progressive gays to become Republicans. I am asking them to stop fear-mongering about this,” - [Guy Benson](https://x.com/guypbenson/status/1856346185600029144).

“TGNCIQ+. Trans, gender-nonconforming, intersex, queer plus. This acronym is as insane as the previous one, if not more so, but at the moment I’m perfectly OK with it. I guess there’s a TQ without the LGB after all,” - [Ben Appel](https://x.com/benappel/status/1855355393657970887). I would love this new acronym to become official. It helps distance sane gay men and lesbians from this transqueer insanity.

### Yglesias Award Nominees

“Babyyyyyy y’all gone really hate me when I say I don’t believe children should be medically transitioning. I think affirming them to outwardly express the gender they identify with until adulthood is plenty. Period,” - [Kerri Colby](https://x.com/Provokatov/status/1856821234539118978), a _RuPaul’s Drag Race_ contestant and trans woman.

“This is not a place of judgment. I’m not gonna, like, put your stuff on blast or anything like that, or dunk on it. That’s like, genuinely not the intent here. I actually want to learn from you,” - [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/aoc-trump-voters_n_67320370e4b052f25adcff55) to the Trump voters who also voted for her.

### Dissents Of The Week: A Trump Awakening?

A reader writes:

> When I opened your Dish email last Friday, I fully expected a big serving of both-sides-y handwringing — as in, “Trump is bad, but Harris is also bad, because wokeness/inflation/illegal immigrants … poor voters, what were they to do?” But I was also hoping for an acknowledgement of how terribly painful it is that the lawless kakistocrat has been reelected, more resoundingly than the first time. 
> 
> Instead, I got a celebration of the multiracial, multiethnic coalition that brought us Clown Car Horror Show 2: Electric Boogaloo. 
> 
> Not a single solitary goddamn word about all the reasons why Agent Orange deserved to lose. Attempting to overturn a free election in 2020? Inciting a mob to attack the Capitol? Running on “retribution” and promising to deploy the justice system against his political opponents? Routine use of crass, ugly insults and normalizing his surrogates’ use of same? Musing about how he wants to be “dictator for a day”? Wanting to fire government workers and replace them with incompetent sycophants? Never heard of it. 

In the immediate wake of the Trump victory, did we really need another account of why I didn’t vote for him? Especially when those arguments failed to work in the campaign yet again? Go read _The Bulwark_.

Another reader on wokeness:

> My goodness, will you ever give it a rest? Yes, this result was a repudiation of identity politics. It laid bare just how irrelevant the tired, anti-woke outrage machine is to the folks who swing elections. People don’t care much about other people’s gender identity when their primary issue is making ends meet.

Except they did. A swing of 2.7 percent after watching Trump’s trans ads! And another:

> As we watch the orange-spray-painted rapist and convicted felon talk about tribunals for his critics and putting rifles in the face of Liz Cheney, I just can't get overly worked up over whatever gender feminist intersectionality blather may be happening on a college campus somewhere. Please! Read the (burning) room!

It’s not restricted to a college campus, FFS. If you can’t see that now, I give up. Another reader invokes [Chait](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-unprecedented-and-powerful-mandate-is-a-lie.html):

> In the big picture, Trump won because literally every opposition party running for office anywhere in the world is winning right now. Every single governing party in the developed world that has stood for reelection in 2024 has lost, the _Financial Times_ notes. This has never happened before in the 120 years of data it has followed.

Chait has gotten every major political question spectacularly wrong for a decade. Forgive me if I take his wisdom unseriously. In the end, he’s a partisan hack. Always has been. Making excuses for yet another Democratic loss is on brand. He’ll fit in perfectly at _The Atlantic_.

On the general question of dealing with this new administration, watch this space. The Dish was relentless in holding Trump to account in his first term (without falling for many of the resistance over-reaches). We will do so in his second, fear not. But one thing I learned from the first term: it’s better not to become an instant-reaction-machine to Trump’s provocations. It helps him more than it helps us.

I regard the Gaetz and Kennedy announcements as God-level trolling, as Fetterman put it. I’ll put the boot in Trump as soon as next week. But we have a rare window right now to get the Dems to grasp why they lost. I intend to take advantage of it.

More dissents are over on the pod page, arriving in your in-tray shortly. As always, please keep the criticism coming: **dish@andrewsullivan.com**.
