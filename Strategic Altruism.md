**Keji Mao (毛克疾）** @kejimao [2025-12-26](https://x.com/kejimao/status/2004362360132456484)

Since the late 1990s, the United States has adopted a position of “strategic altruism” towards India, assuming that a rising democratic India would balance China.

Washington paid real diplomatic costs to back New Delhi—most notably, carving out a special exception to global non-proliferation norms.

Trump’s second term breaks sharply with that logic: steep tariffs, visa-fee hikes, tighter limits on Indian outsourcing, and consistently disparaging rhetoric towards New Delhi.

Many Western observers treat this as a temporary “Trump anomaly”, blame India’s weak capability, or point to a shift in how Trump conceives competition with China (less geopolitics, more economics).

These takes miss the structural pattern—both across Trump’s ally policy and in why India is being targeted. The root driver is US anxiety over its declining strength, which now outweighs concern about external geopolitical threats.

This decline-anxiety makes Trump more cautious towards hard retaliators like China and Russia—heavy rhetoric, restrained action—to avoid costly conflicts that could drain resources and accelerate US weakening.

In this frame, allies become “blood bags” (血包), the US preferring to squeeze partners for immediate gains over paying uncertain costs for long-run strategic contests.

India, meanwhile, has enjoyed US indulgence but lacks the industrial/economic heft of Japan, Europe or Korea to make major concessions—and is less willing to bend—so it is cast as “conspicuously ungrateful”.

US-India tensions are likely to worsen as service-sector competition hardens and, amid anti-immigration politics, the visibility of the Indian diaspora makes India an easier target for populist pressure.

Looking ahead, America’s relative decline alongside India’s rise—and a dominant China—might even allow Beijing’s structural tensions with Washington and New Delhi to mutually unwind, triggering a fundamental geopolitical realignment in China’s favour.

Interesting read. The author sees China in pole position and the U.S. and India fighting for second position.

I would have agreed if China had already rebalanced to a consumption-led economy. It’s still export-driven and depends on global demand (if not U.S. demand), which is

Hasn’t the “India Trade” for the last 5 years been very disappointing? It’s not the same political and industrial set up as China in the 2000s.

Very interesting

You are definitely overstating China dominance but the rest is very illuminating

What makes you so assertive on that point?

Think no matter what, developments & blips in the short run, in the long run, there is no getting away that China will remain the primary adversary to India, not US, while US-India will be far more aligned than India-China ever can.

“Washington paid real diplomatic costs…”; biggest lie. They sanctioned India, assassinated Homi Bhaba, and some prime ministers as well for good measure, and enabled Islamist dictatorship on both sides which led to the rape and death of millions in 1971. Hats off building up the

This is a poor analysis. U.S. and China are moving towards an inevitable war, which should break out somewhere around 2029. No favours to India have much to do with India's increasing irrelevance on the Asian and global stage, aided by years of clueless governance by Modi.

I think the writer doesn't understand the domestic situation here. Indians- a brown complexioned people- have thrived in the US without whiteness. For this, they are despised. Many right wing pundits have had it out for them for two decades or so.

All good until the last sentence, which seemed like a wish list. India’s rise also makes China anxious so it unleashes its dogs in the subcontinent to distract. India won’t bend to US nor to Chinese hegemony. And that would make China err in its anxiety, like Soviet Union.
