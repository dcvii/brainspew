Well then he can fucking ask ChatGPT. They’re programmed to be polite.  
The shit deserves a bag of bots who can’t and will not fight.  
If he dares ask a grown man who for honor scrapped and bled.  
He’s bound to take a grown man’s hand or fist upon his head.  
This is the risk of manhood, and such will give alarm.  
Who think a badge of courage is a tattoo on their arm.  
Who sit in class upon their ass preparing for a trigger.  
Who fear the world and shy away from challenges much bigger.  
Dazed and confused from all its news because they cannot figure.  
Why they can’t be and they can’t see  
Why they can’t play and they can’t say  
Why their knees buckle, why they can’t suckle.  
Or simply ken why they’re not men.
