### The Dell Gines Interview

Dell's Site has disappeared from view. So I have recovered this from the Internet Archive, especially for the benefit of new Cobb readers who may be directed here from my appearance on Warren Olney's show of 4/10/08.

## An Interview With Michael Bowen AKA Cobb - Founder of the Conservative Brotherhood

![](http://web.archive.org/web/20060822035926/http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/images/cobb_icon.gif) I would like to say thanks to Cobb who was open to doing an interview on why he founded the Blog Collective called ‘The Conservative Brotherhood’. He talks about where he came from, why he is a ‘Black Republican’ (currently dropping ‘black’ from Republican), and why he founded the Conservative Brotherhood, and what he would like to see it become. When you get a chance, visit his blog by clicking [HERE](http://web.archive.org/web/20060822035926/http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/) or visit his general site by clicking [HERE](http://web.archive.org/web/20060822035926/http://www.mdcbowen.org/p1/index.htm)

**Cobb Interview**

**First Tell us a little about yourself?**  
I grew up in Southern California and have very vivid memories of the  
late 60s. We spoke swahili at home and celebrated kwanzaa at the very  
beginning of the movement. Pops was a scholarly nationalist. I was the  
oldest of five kids and we grew up in a neighborhood overrun with kids.  
I attended catholic school and was a ‘brainiac’. I did the  
scholar-athlete thing in Highschool but all I really cared about was  
computers, soccer and diving. Still, I tended to be philosophical even  
then. I wondered why everybody else’s folks weren’t serious about the  
Movement. I worked four years out of highschool then worked my way  
through a computer science undergrad at the state U. I got involved  
heavily in campus and national student politics through NSBE which  
really changed my life. I went overboard with Thomas Sowell even though  
I had worked with the Rainbow Coalition. I did the Joe College stuff  
big time making up for lost time. I wound up at Xerox Systems Group and  
became an evangelist of sorts for their technology. It all made pefect  
sense to me. After Xerox fumbled, I decided to work as a field  
consultant. It was all about building systems where the customers were.  
I haven’t changed much on that score. I was king of the Buppies during  
the 80s - pretty much all the way through. BMW, Nordstrom’s wardrobe,  
American Express card.. the whole deal.

I moved to NYC in 1991 after the death of my brother and watched the LA  
Riots from Brooklyn. I pretty much abandoned the Buppie scene in ‘90  
and started indulging my artistic sensibilities. Read a lot of the Critical  
Theorists, and Blues Aesthetic. Wrote a lot of performance poetry and  
got online to do community work. Also my discovery of what was going on  
in Namibia, Oliver North’s crap and the invasion of Grenada put my  
patriotism on ice. So I was doing the whole Chomsky bit for a while. I  
settled in around Cornel West in an attempt to be what he was trying to  
be when he cut his extra wack hiphop album.

Marriage and kids pulled me out of the radical mode and in 1994 for the  
first time I got serious about making money. Finally, it wasn’t about  
me. I was 33 at the time and realized how simple life could be. I’d say  
that fact and reading Gwaltney really changed my perspective about  
blackfolks.

I moved back to California in 1997 and soon did the whole Silicon  
Valley thing. All these years, since 92, 93 I had been on the internet. At  
Xerox, before that, I ran the internal Blacknetwork. It was all a part  
of my writing life which started back in 1982. It was the performance  
poetry that gave me the courage to say what I really believed in front  
of people, so I’ve always been fearless online.

**What gave you the idea to start the Conservative Brotherhood?**  
It was a long time coming really. I mean for a decade I’ve been looking  
for a community of blackfolks who did some serious intelligent writing  
about the issues of the day. It wasn’t until the invention of blogs  
that folks who have been there all along had the ability to control their  
online environment enough to get out the cogent thinking that had been  
going on.

From my perspective, the Conservative Brotherhood needed to be because  
what conservative blacks were and are saying is more important for the  
nation to hear than the standard liberal and progressive lines. I  
believe that we are the only ones creating new opportunity for  
blackfolks - we’re felling trees in a new direction, everybody else is  
on safe, plowed under ground. So I borrowed a relatively tried and  
true idea, a blog league (I had already joined the Bear Flag League) and  
said let’s do it.

I had already tried and failed to create a grass roots web community. I  
bought the domain oldschoolrepublicans.net and built it, but nobody  
came. I had been hanging out on Yahoo and various other public forums  
but I wasn’t particularly impressed. In fact I went to Project 21 as  
well, and I just didn’t see that they had the bandwidth to handle all  
the issues in a form appropriate for my interests. In the end it had to  
be bloggers.

**Who are the members, and how were they selected?**  
I sent out emails to the right of center bloggers I respected the most.  
Every one of them was an independent thinker, a proven blogger, a good  
writer and beholden to no one. It was very easy to see who these folks  
were. Everybody accepted, and we were off.

**Where do you see the Conservative Brotherhood going down the line?**  
I have committed to help build a portal site which will RSS all of TCB  
posts and then attaching a commenting community to that. It should work  
pretty much like Daily KOS in structure. As the members do their own  
thing, the notariety should grow - I certainly plug it when I’m invited  
to speak. We registered with NZ Bear as a blog community. We’ll  
probably have another round of inductions this year. We lost Michael King to big  
media and he’ll be missed, but time marches on. I think the outlook is  
bright.

We’ll probably collaborate to get a little more specific on policy  
positions and common shared values and their implications. But we have  
done well in being a diverse group of right opinions without any kind  
of orthodoxy or litmus tests that cause unnecessary friction. That’s  
important because we said from the first that there are plenty of  
different kinds of right of center African Americans. We are actually a  
pretty broad coalition.

**What does being a ‘black’ conservative mean to you?**  
It means headaches. Being a black conservative is painting a target on  
your head - it’s unconventional and something of a radical move. People  
simply don’t believe that blackfolks are in their right mind to be  
conservative. As soon as you start representing that way you enter a  
new realm and it’s very easy to get in trouble - not because of what you’re  
saying, but because you are saying it at all. There are very few  
conservative ideas that blackfolks haven’t heard or acknowledged, it’s  
just that American notions of what a black man or woman can get up and  
say in public is very limited, and this is a direct consequence of  
racial stereotypes against us. But again, the problem is mainly one of  
deportment. Can you stand up saying out loud what you really believe  
without making a fool of yourself?

So that’s the first hurdle, and believe me it’s a big one. Then you  
have to navigate and situate yourself within the broad American Right.  
Because it’s foreign territory for people who don’t live it, you  
instantly get associated with people and ideas you don’t even know.  
Like suddenly I’m an apologist for Tom DeLay and I’m supposed to account for  
him? For someone like me who is a relatively recent convert to the  
Republican Party, you have to deal with your own stereotypes of the  
Right and with the Left’s stereotypes of the right. Basically, people  
who don’t want to work through all that just throw up their hands and  
call you a traitor to the race, which is the biggest spitwad they can  
hurl.

After you get through all that, you now have to reconcile yourself to  
your position and ask exactly what is it that you bring to the table.

What does this new world need or want from you? Sometimes it’s just  
your black face, and that’s a letdown. The GOP wants votes and money, the  
ideologues and thinktankers want insights and rhetorical support. The  
local activists want feet on the street and bodies volunteering.  
Everybody wants something.

It’s a tricky road to navigate, especially if you’re being thoughtful  
about it. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but that’s my way. I want to leave  
no implication unconsidered. So I pay attention to my impact as a black  
conservative and as a conservative black. It’s not dual consciousness  
because I know my own path and where I’m heading, but I do consider  
what multiple political communities are thinking in relationship to my  
vector. In this regard I’ve been especially careful to recognize my own  
roots in Progressive politics even through bitter disagreement. It  
means nothing to me if the whole process isn’t organic. If I didn’t think  
that African Americans don’t already have well-lived-in reasons to ‘be’  
conservative, I wouldn’t bother with the black label.

In the end I’m getting rid of ‘black’ with regard to the label of  
‘black Republican’ because of that essential understanding. There is nothing  
about being black that procludes one from being a good Republican  
except fear to face all the challenges I’ve mentioned above. Once you deal  
with the existential hurdles it’s over. You’re no more a black Republican  
than you are black Bachelor of Science. Yeah there was a time when  
there were none, but get over it. I think it should only be a temporary  
label, and I think I had a tough time getting through it because I did much of  
my conversion in public in broad daylight as an advocate. I’ve got a  
hundred essays to prove it.

**How did you come by your political views?**  
I would say that I have had two or three major epiphanies, but it has  
always been a practical evolution for me. I never read a book like  
‘Profiles in Courage’ and said — ooh that’s the political thing I  
aspire to. My politics are part of my civic duty, something I feel very  
strongly. I tend to be philosophical, and I want to know what politics  
does, and why is what politics do well not done as well by science or  
religion. I view politics as a way to acquire and act on knowledge.  
What’s interesting about political ideology is they are generally  
shaped by what people are interested in ignoring and discounting, which is  
kind of the opposite of economics which is shaped by people’s perception of  
their self-interest. Its tangential to faith which is shaped by  
people’s perception of the unknowable.

What I refused to know prior to my conservative epiphany was the cost  
of dismissing the ambitions of the middle class. That is what Stalin did  
and what despots do all over the world. But it’s also what bohemians  
and revolutionaries do - and a lot of Progressives come from that  
orientation. I know I did. When I decided that the interests of home  
and family and middle class mediocrity are essential to the fabric of a  
stable and prosperous nation the appeal of conservatism became  
immediately clear to me. I was back where I was as a college freshman  
reading Sowell for the first time and the middle class became a  
beautiful thing.

I think that if I would have gotten rich in Silicon Valley as I planned  
to, I’d still be a pretentious progressive, or libertarian.

**Finally, do you honestly, all rhetoric aside, feel that the  
Republican Party would do black Americans right in terms of economic, social,  
and political development or would an aggressive third party be a better  
fit?**  
Black Americans who have every honest desire to get with the mainstream  
economy, society and politics are going to be indistinguishable by the  
party. Until you start putting race on the 1040 forms and the IRS stops  
giving tax cuts by race, were already automatically in the program. I  
think that people who would rather have the squishy soulful things than  
inclusion in the vast anonymous dont-care-if-youre-black mainstream are  
going to be left out. The Republican Party is not going to make any  
special considerations for the psychic burden of being black, and they  
shouldn’t. That should be on blacks to do their own mental liberation.  
Part of being an American is about getting paid. So the the extent that  
the Republicans are good for doing some of that, then you owe it to  
yourself to get in line with everybody else.

I think that social development is the tough thing, and I recognize  
thatblack political traditions put a heavy burden on things that  
Republicans don’t pay much attention. So there is a trade off. But I think it’s a  
trade-off that upscale and independent minded African Americans can  
easily make - that is if they care about politics at all. I’m putting  
it at 25%. Black families that are in the Cosby Show / Different World  
demographic are right there. I mean Denzel Washington is Republican, so  
what’s so hard to understand about where he’s coming from?

An aggressive third party? That will be the Greens if they get a  
foothold, but I suppose I’d rather have them than what Germany has,  
Christian Democrats. But I don’t think the prospects for a third party  
in the US are good at all. It really depends on how far Christian  
fundamentalists push the Republicans and how seriously the GOP takes  
them. There’s a big difference between Bill Bennett and Pat Robertson,  
and if the Robertsons win, the Bennetts will bolt.

African Americans who want somebody to romance them politically have no  
chance. That’s because there’s almost nobody in the hiphop generation  
who has an intellectual understanding of what their own parents  
generation was all about in supporting the Brown decision and King’s  
vision of integration. Our own kids are out of step politically, so how  
is some non-existant third party going to do right by those of us who  
grew up on Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye? That’s what’s goin on.

	Mike is still Mike. Vague but sophisticated.
	I don’t know if he will remember this from our time at Xerox together, but one day I was going through some pics at my parent’s house and came across my little brother’s first grade class pic. Virginia Road School, Mrs. Pleasant, my little bro, Mbowen, and a little girl who years later became my wife’s best friend.
	Although he’s loathe to admit it, his actions in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina proves he is still in touch with his liberal side. Which is a good thing.

	You know, all this time I’ve been reading your posting, I wondered if that was you Brown. It’s good to know you’re alive and well. You know I hate to lose track of people. Last time I heard from you, it was boonies media. Hope things are going well.
	Vague? Damn. I am never going to evade writing a book.
3. Comment by RedBeard — September 26, 2005 @
	Great interview!
	Cobb, your philosophical journey isn’t all that different than mine. My epiphany wasn’t anything sudden either, but more like a long, drawn-out waking up process after suffering years of liberalism’s bad dreams without knowing why I was distressed. Rather like living inside a Hieronymus Bosch painting and then finally discovering that I didn’t have to stay there; the Georges Seurat world was indeed accessible just by deciding to go.
	On the subject of out-of-touch kids, that’s an issue that transcends race. Schools no longer teach civics, current affairs or history. Parents are too busy, whether “fulfilling” their phony-baloney careers or hanging out in a saloon, to teach their kids anything. The MTV generation thinks that history began with the invention of the Sony Walkman, and that anything prior is in the same category with cave paintings.

	Cobb made a perceptive point about the left and its denial of the aspirations of the middle class. Kudos. When I gaze around the world, I see many countries that effectively decimated their middle class in an effort to eliminate poverty. Well, what they ended up eliminating was the middle class…..Woops…

	Vague as in, I sometimes wondered in reading your material if you were leaving a word out that would change the entire meaning of the passage, a word that would clear up what you meant in my mind.
	I left the X in ‘94, the year of the great purge (3 IRIFs in one year, or 1 big IRIF done in three phases.) Check the homepage. Except that I still had hair back then, you’ll see I still look the same. Still the nationalist…what ever that means in 2005.

	Great interview. Cobb is another blog that make up my daily reading. The most interesting thing about the Republican Party is that they are no longer the opposition party. Now that they are the flavor of the month, I think they are in a battle for their soul. The \*Pat Robertson\* Republicans are pushing for one thing while the \*Bill Bennett\* Republicans are losing whatever shred of fiscal credibility they have left. I think the 2008 elections will say a lot on whether the Republican Party can maintain some traction with the black community.

	I dare ask Mr. Cobb if he really is proud to be associated with Ms. La Shawn Barber. (I know he can’t honestly answer that.) I’ve read Mr. Cobb’s blog, and although I disagree with much of his politics, I always learn something new, and I greatly respect his intellect and independent streak. Which is why I don’t understand how he can align with a wacko like Ms. Barber. Other than Cobb, the only other member of the CB worth reading is Booker Rising (a GREAT site).

	*Black Americans who have every honest desire to get with the mainstream

	As if Blacks who are Dems can’t be serious?  
	Is that what is being said?

	I have plenty of disagreements with the Christian Right. From my perspective LaShawn is a populist of that stripe. I don’t expect theory from her, but what is undeniable is that she draws a huge audience. You put the two of us on a stage, and she’ll get more votes. I understand and expect that. I’m an elitist. So unless and until we decide that people who are attracted to Ms Barber should not have voting rights, we are bound to the kind of situation.
12. Comment by [Dell](http://web.archive.org/web/20060822035926/http://www.urbanceed.org/) — September 28, 2005 @
	True, good point Cobb about populism. However, I would argue that she really isn’t of the Christian right. My mom is of the Christian right, and most of the people I go to church with would consider themselves as such as well (I am from Nebraska, go figure).
	I think the audience is driven more by the desire of many to have things presented in black and white as opposed to grey scales where thought has to be applied in a significant manner.
	But I think you are wrong on one thing, if you put the two of you on stage, I think you would ultimately carry the vote as you would be able to speak more directly to the issues. That ‘dem nigra’s bad’ rhetoric only carries you so far in a campaign, eventually some of the more complex questions will have to be addressed.

	Actually, Dell, I’m going to disagree with you. I think Cobb would get smashed if he were put on a stage with La Shawn. People are attracted to that fire and brimstone approach. It is why masses flock to hear a preacher that ain’t saying nau-in’. (Excuse the Ebonics)Has Bush ever given a great speech? I think not but you wouldn’t know it.
	Cobb is too much of an intellectual to ever garner the appeal that La Shawn has. I think Cobb would do a much better job in presenting facts and reason, but all La Shawn has to say is Islamofacist are crossing the border and Cobb is a cooked goose.

	Naw man. It is all about presentation, have you ever heard her interview? Remember, she only represents the fringe, as most Americans are moderate, so that is only going to fly in certain areas and garner her a certain percentage of the vote. Plus when her ideas are opened up to ‘live criticism’ she hasn’t demonstrated the ability to adequetely defend them.
	I told you, I invited her to call into my TV show and debate certain issues didn’t I? I am going to toss the invite out to her again, even though I got cut from her blogroll and she’s pissed at me.

	Well, maybe she would come off as a right-wing nutcase, but I’m not so sure. You are right that she has not shown that she can defend her position without relying on standard clichés and talking-points.
	I’ve noticed that whenever the comments get low she pulls up a race topic as she has done today. I blogged on reparations today. But I’m one that believes the debate on reparations is more academic and is only meant as a red herring by race-baiting sellouts and right-wing white supremacist to get their followers panties in a knot.
