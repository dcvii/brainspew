## Disgust & Homophobia (Inbar et al., 2009)

# **Disgust and Homophobia:** Insights from Inbar et al. (2009) and Related Work

Research in moral psychology links the emotion of **disgust** to negative attitudes toward gay men and broader sexual prejudice. Work by Inbar and colleagues examines both stable differences in how easily people feel disgust (“disgust sensitivity”) and momentary disgust cues (e.g., bad smells) to understand intuitive homophobia.

## Core Findings from Inbar et al. (2009)

- People higher in **disgust sensitivity** were more likely to see an agent as *intentionally* encouraging public kissing by gay men, even when they did not explicitly say such encouragement was wrong, indicating an **intuitive moral disapproval** below explicit reports [1](https://consensus.app/papers/disgust-sensitivity-predicts-intuitive-disapproval-of-inbar-pizarro/fcd2f18dddca5499b2d6eef3940417d9/).
- Disgust sensitivity also predicted **more negative implicit associations** with gay people versus heterosexuals on the Implicit Association Test [1](https://consensus.app/papers/disgust-sensitivity-predicts-intuitive-disapproval-of-inbar-pizarro/fcd2f18dddca5499b2d6eef3940417d9/).

## Disgust, Homophobia, and Sexual Morality

- Disgust sensitivity predicts more conservative attitudes, especially on “purity” issues such as **abortion and gay marriage** [2](https://consensus.app/papers/conservatives-are-more-easily-disgusted-than-liberals-inbar-pizarro/344c02117c95581d9e371d4df1f00936/)[6](https://consensus.app/papers/disgust-sensitivity-political-conservatism-and-voting-inbar-pizarro/036e3d7b0584549a9d2a10fdaad5c604/).
- It selectively predicts negative attitudes toward groups seen as **threatening traditional sexual morality** (e.g., pro‑choice activists) and positive attitudes toward groups seen as upholding it (e.g., Evangelical Christians) [3](https://consensus.app/papers/disgust-sensitivity-selectively-predicts-attitudes-crawford-inbar/88cbc60caae252c9a4b14ceda24549c2/).
- Across 31 nations, pathogen‑related disgust sensitivity shows a small but reliable association with **antigay attitudes** and with negativity toward other groups tied to sexual norm violations (e.g., prostitutes) [10](https://consensus.app/papers/disgust-sensitivity-relates-to-attitudes-toward-gay-men-leeuwen-inbar/c89729ee88da54b3a6a20b42fe00f2ad/).

Figure 1 How disgust sensitivity aligns with sexual and political attitudes.

## Experimental Disgust Induction

- Exposure to **disgusting smells** reduces expressed liking of gay men, with little or no comparable effect on lesbians or other groups, suggesting a specific link between disgust and attitudes toward gay men [5](https://consensus.app/papers/disgusting-smells-cause-decreased-liking-of-gay-men-inbar-pizarro/d6dbdd0f364a5ef585616734464de4a8/).

## Summary

Overall, higher chronic disgust sensitivity and momentary disgust cues both predict more **intuitive, often implicit disapproval of gay men**, especially in contexts tied to sexual purity and traditional morality. These disgust-driven responses are intertwined with politically conservative views and broader negativity toward groups seen as violating sexual norms, and they appear across multiple countries and samples.
