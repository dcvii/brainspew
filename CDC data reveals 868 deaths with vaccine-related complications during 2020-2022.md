### CDC National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death Code Analysis

CDC data reveals 868 deaths with vaccine-related complications during 2020-2022, based on Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) codes from US death certificates in the CDC's National Vital Statistics System.

While this figure may represent a vast understatement due to underreporting (undetected, physician bias, etc.), these are documented cases coded by medical professionals on death certificates, establishing a conservative baseline estimate for direct vaccine harm.

It is evident, that the novel vaccines used during the vaccinations campaigns are responsible for this.

Note that if the CDC had coded these with the same methodology as COVID-19, these would all appear as Underlying Cause of Death (UCD) rather than contributing causes. These figures also suggest that injury from these products may be much higher than these documented vaccine deaths.

Historically, vaccines have been withdrawn from market with significantly fewer associated deaths - such as the 1976 swine flu vaccine which was halted after approximately 45-50 deaths from Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. This represents a nearly 20-fold increase over the historical threshold that triggered withdrawal.

The continued promotion of these vaccines despite mounting safety signals represents a significant regulatory oversight that demands immediate action.

Codes used in the analysis:

\- G040: Acute disseminated encephalitis (Encephalomyelitis postimmunization)

\- T881: Other complications following immunization

\- T887: Unspecified adverse effect of drug or medicament

\- T889: Complication of surgical and medical care, unspecified

\- Y590: Viral vaccines

\- Y599: Vaccine or biological substance, unspecified

\- X44: Accidental poisoning by drugs, medicaments, and biological substances

\- Y14: Poisoning by drugs, medicaments, and biological substances, undetermined intent
