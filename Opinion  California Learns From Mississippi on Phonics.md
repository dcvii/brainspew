There are few things people on both sides of the political aisle agree on nowadays, but one is that ditching phonics-based instruction for reading has been a disaster. Even California is now following Mississippi’s lead by returning to phonics.

California’s Legislature this week sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk a “science of reading” bill that emphasizes phonics-based literacy methods that teach children how to read by sounding out words. Most children learned how to read this way until the 1980s. Then a fad of teaching students to read by recognizing and memorizing words caught on in teacher training programs.

Children have struggled with this “whole language” method. Reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) have flat-lined over the last three decades and fallen among lower performers even as per-pupil funding has more than doubled. High rates of illiteracy prompted Mississippi in 2013 to return to phonics-based instruction.

The Magnolia State has since climbed to ninth from 49th place in fourth-grade reading scores on the NAEP tests, often called the nation’s report card. Its low-income students outperform those in all other states. States including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Indiana have followed Mississippi’s lead in recent years by returning to phonics.

Enter California, which is now jumping on the caboose. The Legislature this month passed (unanimously if you can believe it) a law to require the state Board of Education to adopt instructional materials aligned with phonics-based reading. Schools would also get more money to train teachers in phonics.

“We need to create the best opportunities for all kids to read, not just for those who can afford after-school tutors,” said Democratic Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio, the bill’s sponsor. Hear, hear. The state has much work to do. Some 44% of California fourth-graders failed to meet basic reading standards last year on the NAEP test.

Teaching students through phonics won’t by itself solve the country’s K-12 literacy crisis, but it’s an encouraging sign that lawmakers can learn from their blunders and from success in other states.
