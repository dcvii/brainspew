If the ladder used to give you reps, feedback, and a sense of "next," you now have to generate those yourself. This is a 7-day replacement ladder.

Choose your path

These prompts work for anyone, but the starting context matters. Before you begin, identify which situation fits:

Path A: Entry-level / early career You're trying to break in. The traditional entry points are disappearing. You need to create proof that you can do the work before anyone gives you the work.

Path B: Pivoting / mid-career transition You have experience, but not in the direction you want to go. You need to translate existing skills and build new ones fast—without starting over from zero.

Path C: Building something new You're starting a business, a project, or a practice. You don't need a job—you need customers, users, or an audience. The blocker isn't credentials; it's shipping.

Start here

Pick your path (A, B, or C). If you're unsure which path you are, pick the one that matches what you need most right now: job, pivot, or customers/audience.

Run a foundation prompt:

If you want momentum first: run Prompt 0A: Quick Start (60 seconds)

If you can spend 10 minutes: run Prompt 0B: Full Foundation (10 minutes)

Run Prompt 2 (Next Action Spec) and ship today.

End your session with Prompt 5 (Momentum Tracker).

Only Prompts 1, 4, and 6 have path variants. Everything else works for any path.

Rule: Don't run any prompt until you've run Prompt 0A or Prompt 0B. The prompts build on each other. If you skip the foundation, the model will guess—and guessing is how you get generic advice instead of real traction.

Definition: "Consumable" means someone can understand it in 60 seconds without a call—a link, a doc, a short deck, a screenshot, a demo, an email they can forward.

### Loop 1: Ownership

Use when: you feel stuck, resentful, or "waiting for permission."

The old ladder externalized ownership. Your manager told you what "good" looked like. Your role came with a script. That's gone. Loop 1 forces you to define what you're actually trying to do—and what parts of it you can own as projects, not just wish for as outcomes.

Prompt 0A: Quick Start (60 seconds)

Use this if the Full Foundation feels like too much to start. Get moving first, upgrade later.

I need to get moving. Here's the minimum: PATH: \[Entry-level / Pivoting / Building something new\] GOAL (one sentence): TIME HORIZON: \[7 days / 30 days / 90 days\] 7-DAY TARGET ARTIFACT (what I'll ship by end of week): HOURS AVAILABLE THIS WEEK: NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS (1-2 bullets): BIGGEST BLOCKER: ONE PERSON WHO COULD SEE THE WORK: Ask me a maximum of 5 clarifying questions, then produce today's Next Action Spec (Prompt 2 format). Do not give generic advice. Force me to ship something today.

​

Once you've shipped your first artifact, come back and run Full Foundation to build the complete context.

Prompt 0B: Full Foundation (10 minutes)

This prompt blocks the failure mode where AI gives you generic advice and you nod along. It forces questions instead of hallucinated guidance.

You are a strict coach. Do not give advice until you've asked questions to fill every blank below. Ask up to 10 questions total, all at once. If I refuse to answer any, state your assumptions clearly before proceeding. MY SITUATION: - Path: \[Entry-level / Pivoting / Building something new\] - Goal (one sentence): - Time horizon (7 days / 30 days / 90 days): CURRENT REALITY: - What's true right now (job, skills, resources): - What I've tried (and why it stalled): - What's outside my control (list): - What's inside my control as a project (list): CONSTRAINTS: - Hours per week I can actually commit: - Money I can invest (if any): - Responsibilities I can't ignore: MY SKILLS: - 3 strengths I can leverage now: - 3 gaps that are blocking me: Ask your questions. Be direct. No motivation speech.

​

Prompt 1: "It's a project I own" translation (path variants below)

This is the circle exercise from the article, operationalized. You take a fuzzy goal and translate it into controllable projects.

Path A: Entry-level

I want to break into \[field/role\] but I have no traditional entry point. Translate this into: 1. The OUTCOME I can't guarantee (the job, the offer, the interview) 2. The PROJECTS I can own that make the outcome more likely (3-5) 3. For each project: - The skill it builds - The artifact it produces (must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live) - Who will see it and why they'd care 4. The smallest proof I could ship in 72 hours that demonstrates I can do this work Keep it blunt. I don't need encouragement—I need a map.

​

Path B: Pivoting

I'm currently \[current role/situation\] and want to move toward \[target direction\]. Translate this into: 1. The OUTCOME I can't guarantee (the new role, the transition, the opportunity) 2. What TRANSFERS from my current experience (be specific—skills, relationships, knowledge) 3. What I NEED TO BUILD that I don't have yet 4. The PROJECTS I can own that bridge the gap (3-5) 5. For each project: - How it uses what I already have - What new skill it forces me to develop - The artifact it produces (must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live) - Who will see it as evidence I'm serious 6. The smallest proof I could ship in 72 hours that signals the pivot is real Be direct about what transfers and what doesn't. I'd rather know now.

​

Path C: Building something new

I'm building \[business/project/practice\] and I need \[customers/users/audience/revenue\]. Translate this into: 1. The OUTCOME I can't guarantee (the revenue number, the user count, the traction) 2. The PROJECTS I can own that make that outcome more likely (3-5) 3. For each project: - What it tests or proves - The artifact it produces (must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live) - Who sees it and what action I want them to take - How I'll know if it worked 4. The smallest proof I could ship in 72 hours that puts something real in front of a real person No "build an audience first" abstractions. What can I ship that someone would pay attention to or pay for?

​

### Loop 2: Action

Use when: you're researching, planning, or optimizing instead of moving.

The old ladder gave you assignments. Someone else decided what you should work on, how long it should take, and what "done" looked like. Loop 2 replaces that. It forces a tempo: daily action, daily artifact, daily proof that you moved.

Prompt 2: The Next Action Spec (works for all paths)

This is the core daily prompt. Run it every day. It turns "do the thing" into something you can actually execute.

GATE CHECK: If you do not have my Path, Goal, Time horizon, and Constraints from Prompt 0A or 0B, stop immediately and ask for them before proceeding. Do not guess. You are my execution designer. Based on what you know about my goal and constraints, give me ONE next action for today that is: - Startable in the next 10 minutes (no setup, no research, no "first I need to...") - Finishable in 60-120 minutes - Produces an artifact I can show someone (must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live—not a plan, not notes, not a framework) - Has a clear "done" definition that I can't fudge - Moves me closer to my 7-day target artifact (or my 30-day proof ladder if I've built one) Return in this format only: ACTION: DONE LOOKS LIKE: ARTIFACT PRODUCED: WHO WILL SEE IT TODAY (required—name or type + channel; if blank, propose 2 realistic recipients and draft the message): INPUTS I NEED (must already have): STEPS (max 7): FAILURE MODE (the fake-work I'll do instead if I'm not careful): TIMER: \[X\] minutes SHIP TARGET: \[specific time today\] DISTRIBUTION FALLBACK: If I won't send it today, I must choose one: (a) publish to a public link now, (b) send to a low-stakes recipient now, or (c) share with AI roleplaying the recipient, revise once, then send tomorrow morning by 10am local. No second deferral.

​

Prompt 3: Anti-planning guardrail (works for all paths)

Use this when you notice yourself researching, organizing, or "preparing." It calls out the fake work.

I'm about to procrastinate by \[researching / planning / organizing / optimizing / consuming content about my goal instead of doing it\]. Based on what you know about my goal and constraints: 1. Name the 3 most likely fake-work activities I'm about to do 2. For each, give me the replacement action that produces an artifact today (artifact must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live) 3. What's the smallest version of my goal I'm allowed to ship right now—even if it's embarrassing? 4. What's the "good enough" bar I should aim for instead of the "ready" bar I'm hiding behind? 5. Who will see the artifact today? (If I don't have an answer, give me 2 options and draft the message.) Be strict. I'm paying you to stop me, not encourage me.

​

Prompt 4: Two-hour build (path variants below)

This is the "entry-level assignment" replacement. Use it when you have a focused block of time and want to ship something real.

Path A: Entry-level

I have 2 hours. I want to ship something that demonstrates I can do \[type of work\] even though no one has hired me to do it yet. Ask up to 5 questions about what I'm trying to prove and to whom, then produce: 1. A specific artifact I can build in this window (not a plan—the actual thing or a working draft of it; must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live) 2. The "good enough to share" bar (not perfect—shareable) 3. A checklist to get it from draft to shareable (max 5 items) 4. Who I will send it to today and what I'll say (a specific person or type of person, not "post it on LinkedIn") 5. The follow-up action if they respond vs. if they don't Constraints: no extra research. No "first, learn X." I build with what I know and patch gaps as I go.

​

Path B: Pivoting

I have 2 hours. I want to ship something that signals my pivot from \[current\] to \[target\] is real—not just something I'm "thinking about." Ask up to 5 questions, then produce: 1. A specific artifact that bridges my existing credibility with my new direction (must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live) 2. The "good enough to share" bar 3. A checklist to get it from draft to shareable (max 5 items) 4. Who in my existing network will see this today, and what I'll say to them 5. Who in my target space I will send it to (even cold), and what I'll say Constraints: I'm not starting from zero. Use what I already have. Make the bridge visible.

​

Path C: Building something new

I have 2 hours. I want to ship something that puts my \[product/service/offer\] in front of a real person who might care. Ask up to 5 questions, then produce: 1. A specific artifact I can build in this window (a landing page, a demo, an email, a pitch, a sample—must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live) 2. The "good enough to test" bar (not polished—testable) 3. A checklist to get it from draft to sent/published (max 5 items) 4. The specific distribution move: who sees it today, where, and what action I want them to take 5. How I'll know if it worked (one metric, not five) Constraints: no "build the foundation first." I'm testing whether anyone cares before I build more.

​

Prompt 5: The momentum tracker (works for all paths)

Run this at the end of each work session. It prevents the drift where you did something but can't remember what or why it mattered.

I just finished a work session. Here's what I did: \[describe briefly\] Evaluate: 1. Did this produce an artifact? If yes, what is it? If no, why not—and what's the 30-minute action to produce one now? 2. Did anyone see it today? - If yes: who, and what was their response? - If no: this is a problem. I must choose one before ending this session: (a) Publish to a public link now (b) Send to a low-stakes recipient now (c) Share with AI roleplaying the recipient, revise once, then send tomorrow morning by 10am local. Roleplay is allowed once per artifact—if you've already used it, pick (a) or (b). Prescribe the specific action and draft the message. 3. What did I learn that I didn't know before I started? 4. What's the single next action that follows from this session? 5. On a scale of 1-5, how much did this session move me toward my 30-day proof target? Be honest. If the answer to #5 is below 3, tell me what I should have done instead—and make that my next session.

​

### Loop 3: Proof

Use when: you're trying to "be ready" instead of becoming undeniable.

The old ladder gave you credentials: titles, promotions, years of experience. Those are devaluing. What's replacing them is proof-of-work—artifacts that demonstrate you can do the thing. Loop 3 builds a system for generating and compounding that proof.

Prompt 6: The 30-day proof ladder (path variants below)

This replaces the career ladder with a self-built ladder. Each rung is an artifact that gets progressively harder.

Path A: Entry-level

Design a 30-day proof ladder that demonstrates I can do \[target work\] before anyone hires me to do it. Rules: - 8-12 artifacts total, progressively harder - Each artifact must be shippable in <3 hours - Each artifact must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live - Each must have a real audience (even if tiny)—no "save it for later." Specify WHO will see each one. - Each should teach one skill through doing, not studying - The sequence should tell a story: by artifact #12, my ability to do this work should be undeniable Output: 1. Artifact list with working titles 2. What skill each artifact builds 3. Where it gets posted/sent/shown (specific channel) 4. Who will see it (specific person/type) 5. What "good" looks like for each (the bar) 6. How I'll measure response (views, replies, conversations started, etc.) 7. The cumulative story these artifacts tell about my capabilities Don't make this theoretical. I should be able to start artifact #1 tomorrow.

​

Path B: Pivoting

Design a 30-day proof ladder that makes my pivot from \[current\] to \[target\] visible and credible. Rules: - 8-12 artifacts total, progressively harder - Each artifact must bridge my existing experience with my new direction - Each artifact must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live - Each must be shippable in <3 hours - Each must have a real audience—people who can vouch for the pivot or offer opportunities. Specify WHO will see each one. - The sequence should show progression: from "interesting that they're exploring this" to "clearly serious and capable" Output: 1. Artifact list with working titles 2. What each artifact demonstrates about the pivot 3. How it leverages what I already have 4. Where it gets posted/sent/shown (specific channel) 5. Who specifically will see it (names or types) 6. The cumulative story these artifacts tell: where I was → where I'm going → why I'm credible Make the bridge visible. I'm not starting over—I'm building on.

​

Path C: Building something new

Design a 30-day proof ladder that tests whether my \[product/service/offer\] can get traction. Rules: - 8-12 artifacts total, progressively harder - Each artifact must put something in front of real people (not "build in private") - Each artifact must be consumable by someone else without me explaining it live - Each must be shippable in <3 hours - Each should test one assumption about my market, offer, or positioning - The sequence should escalate commitment: from attention → interest → action → payment (or equivalent) - Specify WHO will see each artifact and WHERE Output: 1. Artifact list with working titles 2. What assumption each artifact tests 3. The distribution channel for each (specific) 4. Who will see it (specific person/type) 5. The metric that tells me if it worked 6. The decision I'll make based on the result (continue, pivot, or kill) 7. The cumulative learning these artifacts should generate about whether this is viable I don't need a business plan. I need a testing plan.

​

Prompt 7: Feedback extraction (works for all paths)

Most feedback is useless ("looks great!"). This prompt forces specific, actionable input.

I'm about to share this artifact: \[paste or describe\] The goal of sharing it is: \[what you want to learn or what action you want them to take\] Write: 1. A 2-3 sentence context blurb that tells them what it is and what I'm trying to do (no apologies, no "it's rough") 2. 3 specific questions that force useful feedback (not "what do you think?") 3. A follow-up question if they give vague praise 4. A follow-up question if they give vague criticism 5. What I should do if they don't respond at all Tone: direct, confident, not needy. I'm asking for input because I want to improve, not because I need validation.

​

Prompt 8: The weekly compounding review (works for all paths)

Run this every Sunday (or end of your week). It turns random effort into a system that improves.

Here's what I shipped this week: \[list artifacts\] Here's who saw each one: \[list distribution—person/channel/response\] Here's the response I got: \[list metrics, replies, conversations, nothing—whatever happened\] Do a ruthless review: 1. COMPOUNDED: What from this week builds on previous weeks? What's accumulating? 2. NOISE: What was motion without progress? What should I stop doing? 3. DISTRIBUTION: Did enough people see my work? If not, what's the distribution fix for next week? 4. SKILL: Which skill improved most? Which skill is still the bottleneck? 5. PATTERN: What pattern showed up repeatedly this week—positive or negative? 6. FOCUS: Based on this, what's the single focus for next week? 7. ARTIFACTS: What are the 3-5 artifacts I'll ship next week to advance that focus? Who will see each one? 8. PROOF CHECK: If I keep going at this rate, will I hit my 30-day target? If not, what needs to change? Be honest. I don't need encouragement—I need clarity on what's working.

​

### The Agency Debugger

Use when: you feel stuck, spiraling, resentful, or frozen.

Prompt 9: Stuck diagnosis (works for all paths)

I'm stuck. I know I should be taking action on \[goal\] but I'm not moving. Ask me up to 6 diagnostic questions to identify whether the problem is: - Clarity (I don't know what to do next) - Skill gap (I don't know how to do it) - Fear (I know what to do but I'm avoiding it) - Energy/time (I'm depleted or overcommitted) - Audience (I don't know who to show it to) - Accountability (no one is expecting anything from me) After your diagnosis, prescribe ONE move for the next 60 minutes that: - Addresses the actual blocker (not a generic "just do something") - Produces an artifact (consumable by someone else without me explaining it live) - Includes who will see it today - Is small enough that I can't talk myself out of it If I resist your prescription, tell me what that resistance reveals about the real blocker.

​

Prompt 10: "Skill issue" reframe (without self-blame) (works for all paths)

This is the article's core move—"it's a skill issue"—turned into a process.

I'm struggling with \[specific thing\]. Help me separate: 1. FACTS I CAN'T CONTROL What's actually outside my influence? (Be specific—not vibes, facts.) 2. PROJECTS I CAN OWN What parts of this can I treat as projects, where my effort changes the outcome? 3. THE SKILL I'M MISSING Name it plainly. Not "I need to be better at X." What specific capability, if I had it, would make this easier? 4. THE SMALLEST DRILL What's one exercise or rep I could do this week to build that skill? (Not "learn about it"—practice it. Must produce an artifact.) 5. THE REFRAME Give me the "It's a skill issue, I just don't know how to do it yet" version of my situation. Make it true, not motivational. Keep it compassionate but unsentimental. I'm not looking for comfort—I'm looking for the lever.

​

Prompt 11: Habit loop unblock (works for all paths)

Use this when you know what you need to do, but you can't seem to make time for it consistently.

GATE CHECK: If you do not have my Path, Goal, and Time Horizon from Prompt 0A or 0B, stop and ask for them. Do not guess. I know I need to spend time on \[workstream\] and ship \[artifact type\], but I keep not doing it. Help me figure out why and fix it. First, ask me up to 8 questions to audit: - Where my time actually goes in a typical day/week (not where I think it goes) - Where my energy peaks and crashes - What I'm protecting that I won't admit out loud - What's getting my best hours right now - What constraints I genuinely can't change (job hours, caregiving, commute) - What I'm doing instead in the exact moments I planned to do this (phone, inbox, "one more thing") - What "full" actually looks like vs. what's just friction Then produce: 1. HONEST AUDIT: Where is the time actually going? Name the real trade-offs I'm making. 2. ENERGY MAP: When do I have capacity for hard/creative work vs. when am I running on fumes? 3. THE HIDDEN BLOCKER: What am I avoiding or protecting that's eating the hours I claim I don't have? 4. ONE SLOT: The single most realistic window in my week for high-agency work—not aspirational, not "if everything goes perfectly." The real one. 5. THE MINIMUM VIABLE HABIT: A version so small I can't talk myself out of it (under 30 minutes), tied to an existing trigger. 6. THE FIRST TEST: What I'll ship in that slot this week to prove the habit works. 7. THE FAILURE PATTERN: How I'll probably sabotage this, and the pre-commitment that blocks it. 8. NEXT ACTION SPEC: Use Prompt 2 format for the first habit slot this week. Don't give me a fantasy schedule. Give me something I'll actually do when I'm tired and don't feel like it.

​

### The 7-Day Experiment

If you want to test this playbook, run it as a structured week:

Day 1: Momentum

Run Prompt 0A: Quick Start to get moving fast

Ship your first artifact using Prompt 2

Run Prompt 5 (momentum tracker)

Day 2: Foundation + Build

Run Prompt 0B: Full Foundation to upgrade your context

Run Prompt 1 (translate goal into owned projects)

Ship something using Prompt 2

Run Prompt 5

Day 3: Artifact

Run Prompt 2

Ship something

Run Prompt 5

Day 4: Share

Run Prompt 7 (feedback extraction)

Send your best artifact to one real person

Run Prompt 5

Day 5: Build

Run Prompt 4 (two-hour build)

Ship something more substantial

Run Prompt 5

Day 6: Push

Run Prompt 3 (anti-planning guardrail) if you're stalling

Run Prompt 2

Ship something

Run Prompt 5

Day 7: Review + Plan

Run Prompt 8 (weekly compounding review)

Run Prompt 6 (30-day proof ladder) if you're continuing

What you should have after 7 days:

Not a new mindset. Three concrete things:

A way to convert fuzzy goals into owned projects. You should be able to take "I want a better job / more money / a career change / a successful business" and translate it into what's controllable, what projects you can own, and what skills those projects require.

A daily execution loop that produces artifacts. You should have shipped multiple things this week that didn't exist before—a prototype, a portfolio piece, a memo, a pitch, a case study, a tiny product, a written analysis. Receipts. When credentials matter less and reps are missing, proof-of-work becomes the new rung.

A compounding feedback system. You should know how to ask for feedback that isn't "looks great!", measure what worked, adjust next week's focus, and stop doing fake work.

In other words: a self-generated ladder that keeps getting steeper.

The ladder used to give you reps, feedback, and a sense of "next." You now have to generate those yourself. This is how.
