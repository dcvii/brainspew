I was lamenting the fact that we do not have a Jonathan Swift today to write about the research that is going on in universities today. Then I thought of asking Grok to “Write chapter 7 of Gulliver's Travels to satirize the effect of DEI on science today.” I think that Grok’s work is so great that I wanted to share it with Heterodox STEM. Grok’s perspective may 1) help people realize that postmodern universities may not need the billions of dollars of taxpayer money spent on “STEM”, and 2) stimulate scientists to re-read chapters 5-7 of Gulliver’s Travels.

*Below is a satirical continuation of Gulliver’s Travels by Jonathan Swift, written as a new Chapter 7 in the style of Swift’s biting social commentary. This chapter is set in a new land, the Island of Equalis, where Gulliver encounters a society obsessed with enforcing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) principles in their scientific endeavors, leading to absurd and counterproductive outcomes. The satire targets the modern application of DEI in science, critiquing how dogmatic adherence to these principles can undermine merit, reason, and progress, while maintaining Swift’s tone and style.*

***A Voyage to the Island of Equalis Chapter VII: Of the Author’s Observations in the Academy of Equalis, and the Curious Methods of their Scientific Pursuits***

*Having escaped the tempests of the sea and the peculiar customs of the Houyhnhnms, I found myself cast upon the shores of a new land, which the natives called Equalis. This island, fair in its verdure and populous with folk of diverse countenances, was governed by a Council of Harmony, whose chief aim was to ensure that all endeavors, particularly those of the mind, adhered to the sacred principles of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, which they deemed the highest virtues of their society.*

*I was conducted to the Grand Academy of Equalis, a sprawling edifice where the learned of the land pursued what they called “Science Equitable.” The Academy was a marvel of chaos, with halls adorned not with instruments of discovery but with banners proclaiming “All Truths Are Equal” and “Merit Lies in Representation.” The savants, whom they called Professors of Equitable Inquiry, were engaged in experiments so peculiar that I scarce knew whether to laugh or weep at their proceedings.*

*My guide, a Professor of Inclusive Astronomy, led me first to a chamber where a great telescope stood, its lens obscured by a cloth painted with the visages of underrepresented astronomers from ages past. “This,” said he, “is our Telescope of Equity. We do not gaze upon the stars directly, for that would privilege the eyes of the observer. Instead, we contemplate the contributions of those who were denied the chance to observe, ensuring their perspectives are included in our findings.” I inquired how they determined the positions of the stars. “We vote,” he replied, “and ensure that each constellation is named after a group historically excluded from stargazing. The heavens must reflect our values, not merely the cosmos.”*

*In another hall, I beheld a group of chemists laboring to transmute lead into gold, a pursuit not unlike that of the Laputians, but with a singular twist. Each chemist was chosen not for their knowledge of elements but for their membership in a particular social category, so that the laboratory resembled a parliament of factions rather than a place of inquiry. When I asked why their experiments yielded only smoke and ash, the Chief Alchemist, a woman of great earnestness, explained, “The failure of our transmutations is proof of systemic bias in the laws of nature. We are rewriting the periodic table to be more inclusive, assigning equal reactivity to all elements, lest any be marginalized.”*

*The mathematicians, too, were engrossed in a project to reform the science of numbers. They had decreed that all equations must produce equitable outcomes, for, as their leader proclaimed, “To favor one solution over another is to perpetuate hierarchy.” Thus, they had abolished the concept of “correct” answers, replacing them with a system of “consensus sums,” wherein all answers were accepted provided they were proposed by a sufficiently diverse quorum. I ventured to solve a simple sum—two and two—and was met with reproof. “Your answer of four,” they said, “excludes the lived experiences of those who perceive five or seven. We shall deliberate until all numbers feel represented.”*

*The most astonishing spectacle was in the Hall of Biological Equity, where physicians sought to cure diseases by ensuring that all patients received identical treatments, regardless of their maladies. A man with a broken leg was given the same salve as a woman with a fever, for, as the Head Physician declared, “To treat them differently would be to discriminate by condition.” When I protested that such methods might harm rather than heal, I was informed that the true aim was not health but fairness, and that any cure which favored one patient over another was an injustice.*

*In the course of my stay, I observed that the Academy’s funding was distributed not according to the promise of the research but by the diversity of the researchers’ origins, sexes, and beliefs. A project to study the tides was granted vast sums because its team included members from every coastal village, though none had ever seen the sea. Meanwhile, a lone scholar, who had devised a method to predict earthquakes, was denied support for his “insufficiently inclusive” team, consisting only of himself and his apprentice, both men of similar hue.*

*The consequences of these practices were plain to see. The Academy’s discoveries were few, and those they claimed were oft contradicted by the simplest observations. Bridges collapsed for want of proper engineering, crops failed for lack of tested seeds, and ships sank because navigators were chosen for their diversity rather than their skill. Yet the Equalisians remained steadfast, proclaiming that their science was the most virtuous in the world, for it elevated fairness above truth.*

*I could not help but reflect upon my own country, where the pursuit of knowledge, though imperfect, had once been guided by reason and evidence. In Equalis, I saw a mirror of what might befall any nation that places ideology above inquiry, mistaking equal representation for equal competence. I departed the island with haste, fearing that prolonged exposure to their principles might render me as mad as their savants.*

**Notes on the Satire**

This chapter mimics Swift’s style by using exaggerated, absurd scenarios to critique a contemporary issue—in this case, the application of DEI principles in scientific research. The satire targets the following:

- **Dogmatic Application of DEI**: The insistence on diversity quotas over merit in the selection of scientists and the design of experiments reflects concerns about prioritizing representation over competence.
- **Relativism in Truth**: The rejection of objective answers in favor of “consensus sums” and equitable outcomes satirizes the notion that scientific truth can be subordinated to ideological goals.
- **Misallocation of Resources**: The funding of projects based on diversity rather than scientific promise critiques real-world trends where DEI metrics influence grant allocations.
- **Absurd Outcomes**: The collapsing bridges, failed crops, and sinking ships highlight the practical consequences of prioritizing ideology over empirical rigor.

The tone remains Swiftian—dry, ironic, and exaggerated—while grounding the satire in modern concerns about the politicization of science. If you’d like me to adjust the tone, focus on specific aspects of DEI, or expand on any section, let me know!
