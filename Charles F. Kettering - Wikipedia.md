Among his most widely used automotive developments were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starter_(engine)#Electric" title="Starter (engine)">electrical starting motor</a> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:3">3</a></sup> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead" title="Tetraethyllead">leaded gasoline</a>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:4">4</a></sup> In association with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuPont" title="DuPont">DuPont</a> Chemical Company, he was also responsible for the invention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freon" title="Freon">Freon</a> refrigerant for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigeration" title="Refrigeration">refrigeration</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning" title="Air conditioning">air conditioning</a> systems. At DuPont he also was responsible for the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duco" title="Duco">Duco</a> lacquers and enamels, the first practical colored paints for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production" title="Mass production">mass-produced</a> automobiles. While working with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton-Wright_Company" title="Dayton-Wright Company">Dayton-Wright Company</a> he developed the " <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettering_Bug" title="Kettering Bug">Bug</a> " aerial torpedo, considered the world's first aerial missile.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:5">5</a></sup> He led the advancement of practical, lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stroke_diesel_engine" title="Two-stroke diesel engine">two-stroke diesel engines</a>, revolutionizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive" title="Locomotive">locomotive</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_equipment" title="Heavy equipment">heavy equipment</a> industries. In 1927, he founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettering_Foundation" title="Kettering Foundation">Kettering Foundation</a>, a non-partisan research foundation, and was featured on the cover of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine in January 1933.</p><h2>Early life</h2> <p>Charles was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudonville,_Ohio" title="Loudonville, Ohio">Loudonville, Ohio</a>, United States, the fourth of five children of Jacob Henry Kettering and Martha (Hunter) Kettering. Poor eyesight gave him headaches in school. After graduation he followed his sister Emma into a teaching position at Bunker Hill School. By all accounts he was an engaging and innovative teacher. He attracted students to evening scientific demonstrations on electricity, heat, magnetism, and gravity.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:6">6</a></sup></p> <p>He took classes at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Wooster" title="College of Wooster">College of Wooster</a>, before transferring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University" title="Ohio State University">Ohio State University</a>. He was a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Upsilon" title="Delta Upsilon">Delta Upsilon</a> fraternity. Eye problems forced him to withdraw, and he took a job as foreman of a telephone line crew. At first, the termination of his studies caused him to be depressed.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:7">7</a></sup> Then he found ways to apply his electrical engineering skills on the job, and his spirits revived. He also met his future wife, Olive Williams. When his eye condition improved, he was able to return to his studies and graduated from OSU in 1904 with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineering</a> degree.</p><h2>Career</h2> <h3>NCR</h3> <p>Kettering was hired directly out of school to head the research laboratory at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cash_Register" title="National Cash Register">National Cash Register</a> (later known as NCR Corporation). Kettering invented an easy credit approval system, a precursor to today's credit cards, and the electric cash register in 1906, which made ringing up sales physically much easier for sales clerks. Kettering distinguished himself as a practical inventor. As he said, "I didn't hang around much with other inventors and the executive fellows. I lived with the sales gang. They had some real notion of what people wanted." <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:8">8</a></sup> During his five years at NCR, from 1904 to 1909, Kettering secured 23 patents for NCR. He attributed his success to a good amount of luck but added, "I notice the harder I work, the luckier I get." <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:9">9</a></sup></p> <p>Beginning in 1907, his NCR colleague <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_A._Deeds" title="Edward A. Deeds">Edward A. Deeds</a> convinced Kettering to develop improvements for the automobile.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:10">10</a></sup> Deeds and Kettering invited other NCR engineers, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Talbott" title="Harold E. Talbott">Harold E. Talbott</a>, to join them nights and weekends in their tinkering at Deeds's barn. They became known as the "Barn Gang," and Kettering was called Boss Ket. Their first goal was to find a replacement for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_magneto" title="Ignition magneto">magneto</a>.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:11">11</a></sup></p> <h3>Delco</h3> <p>In 1909, Kettering resigned from NCR to work full-time on automotive developments, and the group incorporated as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delco_Electronics" title="Delco Electronics">Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company</a>, or Delco.</p><h4>The self-starter</h4> <p>The hand crank used to start early automobiles could kick back under some circumstances. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Carter" title="Byron Carter">Byron Carter</a>, founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartercar" title="Cartercar">Cartercar</a>,  died from complications after such an accident in Detroit's Belle Isle park. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_M._Leland" title="Henry M. Leland">Henry M. Leland</a> &nbsp;– the head of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac" title="Cadillac">Cadillac</a> – became determined to develop an electric self-starting device.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:12">12</a></sup> When Leland's engineers failed to develop a self-starter small enough to be practical <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:13">13</a></sup> he consulted Kettering, and Delco developed a practical model by February 1911.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:14">14</a></sup></p> <p>Kettering's key insight lay in devising an electrical system performing the three functions it still serves in modern cars: starter; producer of spark for ignition; and source of current for lighting.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:15">15</a></sup> Leland ordered 12,000 self-starters for his 1912 models; Delco had to then transition from its research and development activities to production.
The invention won a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewar_Trophy" title="Dewar Trophy">Dewar Trophy</a> in 1913.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:16">16</a></sup></p> <p>Kettering helped found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers_Club_of_Dayton" title="Engineers Club of Dayton">Engineers Club of Dayton</a> in 1914.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:17">17</a></sup></p> <h3>Flxible</h3> <figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Time-magazine-cover-charles-kettering.jpg/250px-Time-magazine-cover-charles-kettering.jpg" width="250" height="329" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Time-magazine-cover-charles-kettering.jpg/375px-Time-magazine-cover-charles-kettering.jpg%201.5x,%20//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Time-magazine-cover-charles-kettering.jpg%202x"> <figcaption>Kettering on the cover of Time magazine in 1933</figcaption></figure> <p>In 1914, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flxible" title="Flxible"> Flxible Sidecar Company</a> was incorporated with the help of Kettering, who then became president of the company and joined the board of directors. Kettering provided significant funding for the company in its early years, particularly after 1916, when Kettering sold his firm, the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco), to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Motors_Company" title="United Motors Company">United Motors Company</a> for $2.5 million. Kettering continued to serve as president of Flxible until he became chairman of the board in 1940, a position that he held until his death in 1958.</p><h3>General Motors</h3> <p>Delco was sold to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation" title="General Motors Corporation">General Motors</a> in 1918, as part of United Motors. Delco became the foundation for the General Motors Research Corporation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delco_Electronics" title="Delco Electronics">Delco Electronics</a>. Kettering became vice-president of General Motors Research Corporation in 1920 and held the position for 27 years.</p><p>Between 1918 and 1923, he led the research and development at GM's Dayton research laboratories to commercialize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-cooled_engine" title="Air-cooled engine">air-cooled engines</a> for cars and trucks.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:18">18</a></sup> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Series_M_Copper-Cooled" title="Chevrolet Series M Copper-Cooled">GM "copper-cooled" automotive engine</a> used fans forcing air across copper fins for heat dissipation. The commercialization, attempted between 1921 and 1923, was unsuccessful due to a combination of factors, nontechnical and technical.<sup id="fnref:18-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:18">18</a></sup> Air-cooled engines have had commercial success before and since, used widely in such applications as lawnmowers, small aircraft, and automobiles - notably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle" title="Volkswagen Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a> and many generations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche" title="Porsche">Porsche</a> sports cars.</p><h3>Leaded gas</h3> <p>Kettering's research in fuel was based on his belief that oil would be in short supply and additives would allow more efficient engines with higher compression.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:19">19</a></sup> His "high percentage" solution was to mix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> with gasoline, while his "low percentage solution" looked for additives that would be added in small quantities to increase what later would be called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating" title="Octane rating">octane rating</a> of gasoline.<sup id="fnref:19-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:19">19</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr." title="Thomas Midgley Jr.">Thomas Midgley Jr.</a> and Kettering identified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead" title="Tetraethyllead">tetraethyllead</a> (TEL) in December 1921 as an additive that would eliminate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_knocking" title="Engine knocking">engine knocking</a> at a dilution of one thousand to one.<sup id="fnref:19-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:19">19</a></sup> While use of ethanol could not be patented, TEL's use as an additive could. Kettering and Midgley secured its patent and proceeded to promote the use of TEL as an additive instead of other options.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:20">20</a></sup> Kettering became the first president of the newly founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_Corporation" title="Ethyl Corporation">Ethyl Corporation</a> that started to produce TEL in 1923.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:21">21</a></sup> One year later, he hired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Kehoe" title="Robert A. Kehoe">Robert A. Kehoe</a> as the medical expert to proclaim that leaded gasoline was safe for humans. That its use was an ecological disaster leading to a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_toxicity" title="Lead toxicity">lead contamination</a> was not acknowledged until many decades later.<sup id="fnref:20-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:20">20</a></sup></p> <h2>Personal life</h2> <p>Kettering married Olive Williams of Ashland, Ohio, on August 1, 1905.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:22">22</a></sup> Their only child, Eugene Williams Kettering, was born on April 20, 1908.  Eugene joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winton_Motor_Carriage_Company" title="Winton Motor Carriage Company">Winton Engine</a> in 1930, which was acquired by General Motors and was eventually incorporated into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Electro-Motive_Division" title="General Motors Electro-Motive Division">General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD)</a>.  He became a central figure in the development of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMD_567" title="EMD 567">EMD 567 locomotive engine</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Diesel_Series_71" title="Detroit Diesel Series 71">Detroit Diesel 6-71 engine</a>, serving at EMD until his retirement in 1960.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:23">23</a></sup></p> <p>Charles Kettering built a house, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Kettering_House" title="Charles F. Kettering House">"Ridgeleigh Terrace"</a>, in 1914. According to local sources, it was the first in the United States to have electric air conditioning using freon.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:24">24</a></sup> Ridgeleigh Terrace was the home of his son, Eugene, until his death. Eugene's wife, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Weiffenbach_Kettering" title="Virginia Weiffenbach Kettering">Virginia</a>, lived in the house for many years, restoring and redecorating it. In the late 1990s, the house largely destroyed in a fire, and was rebuilt with serious deviation from the original blueprints to accommodate its current use as a conference center.</p><p>Some of Charles' memorable quotations are: "It doesn't matter if you try and try and try again, and fail. It does matter if you try and fail, and fail to try again.", "Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement.", "My interest is in the future because I am going to spend the rest of my life there.".<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#fn:25">25</a></sup></p> <p>Kettering died on November 25, 1958.
