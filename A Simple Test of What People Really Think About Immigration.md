As debates over immigration rage around us, I would like to propose a simple metric for resolving disputes over whether immigration benefits a particular region or city. It is an imperfect standard, but it has the virtues of being measurable and quantitative and weighing pluses and minuses against each other.

I suggest looking at whether real estate prices in a particular locale have been rising or falling. If immigration is “ruining” a particular city, we would expect homes and other property values in that place to become much cheaper.

Home values have historically served as a strong indicator of the health of a city. Consider Detroit. It was one of the premier American cities in the mid-20th century, but the region lost a lot of its automobile industry to foreign competition, and crime rose precipitously. The city also was poorly managed. The result in real estate markets was a [collapse in prices](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2024/wp24-12.pdf#page=14). If anyone asked you to point to quantifiable evidence for the decline in Detroit, it was easy to do so.

Detroit has undergone a renaissance since its nadir. New businesses have opened, crime rates have fallen, and the city feels more lively again. And since that turn of fortune, often dated around the 1990s, Detroit real estate has made a major comeback, putting aside the price collapse of the Great Recession in 2008. Home prices are not a perfect measure of how the city is doing, but they do pick up major and radical trends, both on the downside and on the upside.

The nice thing about market prices is that they show how buyers weigh the benefits of immigration against costs. Say some new immigrants have moved into your community and the quality of the schools has declined somewhat and traffic is modestly worse. At the same time, there are new businesses, the streets feel more lively, and it is easier to get a good local plumber. In the abstract, it is hard to tell which effects might be most important. But individuals, when bidding for homes or deciding to sell, make their own judgments. What happens to the home prices is a reflection of the collective judgments of people with major decisions about their lives on the line.

Home purchases are a test of “demonstrated preference.” So too, for example, is the decision by left-leaning individuals who say they value mixed-race and -income neighborhoods to choose to actually live in ones that are predominantly white. Now let’s apply such a demonstrated preference test to the question of immigration. Residents may or may not like every trend the new migrants bring, but do they really believe the migrants are causing their city to fall apart? Asking the market—the ultimate reflection of what people choose—is a good way to start addressing that question.

The nice thing about market prices is that they show how buyers weigh the benefits of immigration against costs.

This is relevant not just in the United States but around the world. Sweden has had a very active debate about immigration. Sweden was once a largely ethnically homogeneous country; now one in five people who live in Sweden were born abroad—a higher share than in the U.S. Sweden’s populist right has suggested the country is collapsing under the weight of unwise immigration policies. The country has imposed strict restrictions on asylum seekers, and is offering [350,000 Swedish krona](https://www.migrationsverket.se/en/news-archive/news/2025-10-31-repatriation-grant-to-be-increased-on-1-january-2026.html) (close to $40,000) to some migrants to leave.

I agree that Sweden has handled its immigration unwisely. Still, I hardly think Stockholm is about to fall into doom and decrepitude. Swedish real estate prices show very strong real [upward price trends](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/QSER628BIS) over the last 20 years (again with [some booms and busts](https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/housing-construction-and-building/real-estate/real-estate-prices-and-registrations-of-title/), and a downturn in 2022), with the upward movement in prices continuing over the last few years.

The truth is that Stockholm remains one of the very best cities in the world, for either living or visiting. I went there last year and had a great time, and even spent the better part of a day visiting one of the city’s immigrant “ghettos.” It felt cleaner and more orderly than many parts of suburban America.

Home prices are not a perfect measure of how a city is doing, but they do pick up major and radical trends.

Yes, parts of the city do function badly in some significant ways, and assimilation of immigrants into Sweden’s mainstream is an issue. But the idea that Sweden’s cities have sunk into disorder because of immigration is not borne out by the facts. The number of homicides in Sweden has [stayed roughly stable](https://bra.se/english/statistics/shootings-and-violence#:~:text=Statistics-,Homicides%20in%20Sweden,-Chart) for a decade, slipping meaningfully in 2024. [World Bank data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?locations=SE) shows the overall Swedish homicide rate changing little in more than 30 years. And Swedes appear to be aware of this. When you sum up all relevant pluses and minuses, Stockholm remains a marvelous place, and that’s reflected in what Swedes are willing to pay to live there.

Some important qualifiers are needed for using real estate prices to measure how a city is doing. First, sometimes we are looking at cities during real estate bubbles, or right after the bubble has burst. Those price changes do not reflect real changes in the quality of life, and by definition, they are temporary. Fortunately, we can sidestep this problem by looking at longer-run trends.

Another possible distorting force is that immigrants may be moving into a city, but restrictive laws may make it harder for the private sector to build more apartments and homes for them. Prices may go up because there is more demand pressing on a fixed supply, not because the quality of life is rising. Still, then it is easy enough to shift perspective and look at price trends for the more expensive homes, the ones that recent, less skilled immigrant arrivals are unlikely to move into. For those homes, immigration of unskilled individuals is not inducing a big run-up in demand. So if the prices for the higher-quality housing units are rising or robust, the new migrant arrivals probably are not ruining the city more broadly.

If we consider the United States as a whole, the main magnets for immigrants, such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami, remain very pricey. Home prices have continued to do well in most of the country more broadly. Which suggests that, at the aggregate level, immigration is hardly tearing us apart.

If you do not believe that and you live in one of these places, then you should test your assumption: Will you put your money where your mouth is by selling your home as quickly as possible? I suspect that challenge will find few takers.
