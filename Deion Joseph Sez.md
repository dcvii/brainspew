So I get into it with a friend on another platform who keeps spewing the same propaganda as if anyone who voted for Trump lost their minds and rely on him like God to make our lives better. He also accused me of being willing to sidestep democracy to get the things I want.  
  
I may have lost a friend, because my correction was as follows:  
  
“You folks and your propaganda are nauseating. You think it’s about making my life better? It’s all about me?  
  
You know what I wanted out of Trump?  
  
The same damn thing I wanted out of Obama, Biden, Bush, Big Bush and and Clinton.  
  
Those those things are the following  
  
- Transparency  
- A secure border  
- Honesty  
- Common sense leadership  
- Doing exactly what you campaigned on  
- A strong military  
- An end to political indoctrination in our schools  
- Respect for personal freedom  
- And someone who would think about America first before giving everything to the world while his own people suffer.  
  
Not one of them came through. Each one of them failed. Most didn’t even try. They just faked it well enough that you are still pining for their pipe dream. But guess who did come through? As flawed as he is as a person, it was freaking Trump. A man I was never a fan of personally but respect because he does the hell what he says he’s going to do or tries.  
  
That’s what I voted for. Not some polished fake politician who pretends to be an angel but is doing the devils work as we are distracted by their platitudes and symbolic gestures that get us absolutely no where.  
  
No one is side stepping democracy, genius. By the way, we don’t live in a democracy. We live in a constitutional republic.  
  
But let’s go with your twisted idea of democracy.  
  
Was it democracy when Biden coerced Big Tech into silencing millions of Americans for their opinions and thoughts?  
  
Was it democracy when that old man lied to you and told you he didn’t know about his sons dealings and that the laptop didn’t exist? Because for many that may have changed their vote in the 2020 election if they knew then candidate Biden was compromised.  
  
Was it democracy when he got 51 intelligence agents who we are supposed to trust, to go along with the lie and call it Russian disinformation?  
  
Was it democracy to force people to choose between feeding their damn family and a damn shot in the arm that is causing damage to a lot of people?  
  
Was it democracy when Biden flew in hundreds of thousands of migrants in the middle of the night without telling us and also opened the borders? Did we the American people have a say in that? No the heck we didn’t.  
  
Was it democracy when if we question elections or vaccines that we get silenced and are forced to self sensor just to survive?  
  
It that’s your democracy? You can keep that crap bro, respectfully.  
  
Trump is no God or saint but it’s a damn shame it took a flawed man to do right by the American people. He’s showing you how corrupt your government truly is and I’m here for it. No regrets whatsoever.”
