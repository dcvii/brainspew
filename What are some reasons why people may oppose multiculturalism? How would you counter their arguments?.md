I oppose multiculturalism because it has become hardened into a shortcut for race, and race is a zero-sum idea. If this were not the case, nobody would use the term ‘cultural appropriation’.

Cultural appropriation means that by dint of your race, you will be incapable of ‘authentic’ expression of another culture. IE, Funk music belongs to the Black Race. This is not the proper ethos for a free and open society. A free and open society shares culture. It is because of that sharing that we get fusion. And fusion is the consequence of an ethos of integration, not one of separation and segregation.

Multiculturalism breeds division and it rewards a refusal to integrate. It scoffs at the very idea of integration and the very reality of America as a melting pot. It holds that there is nothing of value that the evolution of American society and culture has provided and that ‘indigenous’ cultures are superior and that such cultures cannot be shared, but rather they must be empowered.

And there is your keyword. Power.

Anyone who suggests that the aim of cultural expression is power, is the sort of multiculturalist that doesn’t care about the edifications of culture and creativity. Rather they care about power and privilege. They aim to get this through redistributive politics.

I welcome counter arguments in the comments. I’m here all year.
