**Q:** “Did 30,000 scientists declare that climate change is a hoax?”
**A:** No.
***I and 31,486 other American scientists***, including engineers in relevant disciplines, really ***DID*** sign the <a href="http://www.petitionproject.org/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>Global Warming Petition</u></b></a>.
It is completely legitimate, and has far more signers than any of the climate alarmists' petitions.
It is a real petition, too, not just Internet clicks. We had to submit real, physical signatures, on paper, and list our relevant qualifications, to get our names added.
In my case, it took two tries to get my name added. (Perhaps my first attempt didn’t give sufficient details about my qualifications.)
But the Petition does ***NOT*** declare that "climate change is a hoax."
That is a false statement, <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/30000-scientists-reject-climate-change/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>invented by Snopes' Alex Kasprak</u></b></a>, who was playing ***straw-man*** games. The actual petition says nothing like that:
**‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍** <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/straw%20man" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>straw man</u></b></a> *n.* a weak or sham argument set up to be easily refuted.
If the petition had said that climate change is a hoax, I would not have signed it. Most of the other signers probably wouldn't have, either.
Snopes used to be quite trustworthy, albeit with a slight liberal bias. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. Since Barbara Mikkelson's departure, Snopes is less trustworthy than some of the sources they pretend to debunk.
It is clear that Barbara was the ethical anchor for Snopes, and without her <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4042194/Facebook-fact-checker-arbitrate-fake-news-accused-defrauding-website-pay-prostitutes-staff-includes-escort-porn-star-Vice-Vixen-domme.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>they’ve gone completely off the rails</u></b></a>. Snopes is now very biased, very leftist, and very unreliable.
The Global Warming Petition attests to our conclusion that:
**"There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.”**
That is all still true. Indeed, evidence supporting that statement has continued to accumulate, in the ≈21 years since it was written.
Few people (and *very* few scientists!) actually deny that climate change (global warming) is real. 25,000 years ago the sites of present-day Boston and Chicago were under a sheet of ice which is believed to have been about a mile thick! So you can bet your sweet bippy that climate change really occurs (fortunately).
The climate debate has never been about whether climate change is real. It is. The debate is over its scale, its attribution (how much of it is caused by mankind), and its effects (beneficial vs. harmful).
There's ***no scientific consensus that climate change is harmful***. That’s why <a href="https://www.quora.com/It-is-claimed-that-97-of-climate-scientists-state-that-anthropogenic-climate-change-is-real-What-evidence-do-the-3-who-dont-think-so-have-What-are-some-good-counterarguments-to-their-claims/answer/Dave-Burton-2" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>when climate activists survey scientists</u></b></a> about their opinions on climate change, they don’t ask whether climate change is harmful, because if they did then their surveys wouldn’t show a consensus.
In fact, ***the best scientific evidence is that manmade climate change is modest and benign****,* and higher CO2 levels are ***beneficial****,* for both mankind and natural ecosystems.
Although other Answers posted here call people like the scientists who signed that petition, and everyone else skeptical of climate alarmism, “deniers,” they’re more accurately described as ***“climate realists.”*** They are, on average, more realistic, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/182159/college-educated-republicans-skeptical-global-warming.aspx" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>better educated</u></b></a>, and better informed about climate change and its effects than are most climate alarmists.

Facts supporting the Global Warming Petition statement have continued to pile up, in the years since it was written. For example:

-  The fact that “<a href="https://sealevel.info/obama_change_we_can_believe_in.jpg" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>change</u></b></a>” isn’t always bad. The Earth’s climate today, with <a href="https://www.sealevel.info/co2.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>CO2 levels</u></b></a> around 410 ppmv (up from about 365 ppmv when the Petition was written), is, by all reasonable measures, ***much better*** than it was when CO2 was only 280 to 285 ppmv, during the chilly “pre-industrial” Little Ice Age.
-  The fact that the much-hyped “1.5 °C of warming,” which <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>the IPCC has proposed</u></b></a> as the target beyond which the Earth must not be allowed to warm, ***doesn’t actually mean 1.5 °C of warming***. It actually means only about 0.5 °C of warming, because what they call “1.5 °C” is referenced to an estimate of the average temperature during the chilly Little Ice Age, rather than to current temperatures, to make the number sound bigger.
-  The <a href="http://sealevel.info/mwp_lia.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>strong evidence</u></b></a> that there's nothing at all unusual about the modest warming which the Earth has experienced over the last century. The current “Modern Climate Optimum” is very similar to the <a href="https://sealevel.info/glossary.html#mwp" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>Medieval Warm Period</u></b></a> and the <a href="https://sealevel.info/glossary.html#rwp" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>Roman Climate Optimum</u></b></a>, and <a href="https://www.ncas.ac.uk/index.php/en/climate-blog/397-warm-past-climates-is-our-future-in-the-past" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>probably cooler than the mid-Holocene Warm Period, and most of the Eemian interglacial</u></b></a>.
-  The fact that CO2 emissions have <a href="http://co2coalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Rising_CO2__Food-Security-2-21-19-1.pdf" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>major, proven benefits</u></b></a>, both for human agriculture and for natural ecosystems.
-  The fact that, even though CO2 levels have been rising monotonically for over two-thirds of a century, the supposed major harms from CO2 emissions are ***all***  still merely hypothetical (and mostly implausible). ***None*** of the hypothesized major harms imagined as consequences of rising CO2 levels are ***actually happening.***
-  The fact that the <a href="http://sealevel.info/greening_earth_spatial_patterns_Myneni.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>Earth is “greening</u></b></a>**,”** <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/05/greener-deserts-higher-co2-climate-change_n_3391267.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>deserts are retreating</u></b></a>, and <a href="https://www.sealevel.info/Pearce2002_Africans_go_back_to_the_land_as_plants_reclaim_the_desert-New_Scientist.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>Africans are returning to the land</u></b></a> in the arid Sahel, because a higher atmospheric CO2 level helps plants grow, and helps make them more water-efficient and drought-hardy.
-  The fact that even *National Geographic*, which heavily promotes the climate scare, nevertheless admits that anthropogenic climate change is greening deserts (though they didn't mention that it's the CO2 that's responsible):

<a href="http://sealevel.info/Owen2009_Sahara_Desert_Greening-NatGeo30639457.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>National Geographic: Sahara Desert Greening Due to Climate Change?</u></b></a>
Here's an excerpt:
Images taken between 1982 and 2002 revealed extensive regreening throughout the Sahel, according to a new study in the journal *Biogeosciences.*
The study suggests **huge increases in vegetation** in areas including central Chad and western Sudan. ...
In the eastern Sahara area of southwestern Egypt and northern Sudan, new trees—such as acacias—are flourishing, according to Stefan Kröpelin, a climate scientist at the University of Cologne's Africa Research Unit in Germany.
*“Shrubs are coming up and growing into big shrubs. This is completely different from having a bit more tiny grass,”* said Kröpelin, who has studied the region for two decades. ...
***“Before, there was not a single scorpion, not a single blade of grass,”***he said.
***“Now you have people grazing their camels in areas which may not have been used for hundreds or even thousands of years. You see birds, ostriches, gazelles coming back, even sorts of amphibians coming back,”*** he said.
***“The trend has continued for more than 20 years. It is indisputable.”***
-  The facts about the CO2 “<a href="http://www.sealevel.info/resources.html#plants" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>fertilization effect</u></b></a>**,**” and why commercial greenhouse operators use “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=co2+generators" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>CO2 generators</u></b></a>” to elevate CO2 levels in their greenhouses to 3× to 4× outdoor levels: because it is tremendously beneficial to the plants.
-  The fact that higher outdoor CO2 levels are helping to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>make famines rare</u></b></a>, for the first time in human history.
Famine used to be a scourge comparable to war and epidemic. For comparison: WWII killed 2.7% of the world’s population, and the catastrophic 1918 flu pandemic killed about 2% of the world’s population. But the global drought and ***famine of 1876–78 killed about 3.7% of the world’s population***!
But now, *“*<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100113183137/https:/www.independent.co.uk/environment/snowfalls-are-now-just-a-thing-of-the-past-724017.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><i><u>children just aren't going to know</u></i></b></a>*what  ̶s̶n̶o̶w̶*  ***famine*** *is,”* — thanks, in significant part, to anthropogenic climate change.

Sea-level rise is ***supposedly the worst*** of the negative effects of anthropogenic global warming, but the measurements prove that’s nonsense. Here’s a particularly high-quality, 110-year measurement record at Honolulu, showing a very typical sea-level trend. Sea-level is rising about 1½ mm/year (6 inches per century), with no acceleration in nine decades or more:

Here are some similar graphs of global CO2 level juxtaposed with high-quality sea-level measurements from the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, Baltic Sea, North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and Adriatic Sea:

The fact that the <a href="https://www.sealevel.info/avgslr.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><b><u>average rate of coastal sea-level rise is only about six inches per century</u></b></a>, and the rate is not increasing, and has not significantly increased since the 1920s. That rate is so tiny that in many places it is exceeded by local processes, like erosion, sedimentation, and vertical land motion. Here’s an example of one such place, where measured “sea-level rise” is negative, because the land is rising more than three times as fast as the ocean:
