On Monday, a letter from a doctor inside Iran was [posted online](https://x.com/IHRDC/status/2010714719817019903) by Tavaana, a U.S.-based educational nonprofit. “I’m writing this so you can urgently share it wherever you can,” it read. “What we hear from BBC, Iran International, and other satellite networks shows that the reality in Iran is still not understood. They keep saying security forces are hesitant or weaker than before, and that mass killing hasn’t happened. The truth is exactly the opposite.”

Three days ago, the Iranian regime sent security forces to brutally crush the thousands of demonstrators who have taken to the streets to protest the Islamic Republic. Reported estimates of casualties vary wildly: HRANA, an Iranian human rights group, says it is several hundred. The regime’s [own officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/world/middleeast/iran-protester-deaths.html) say 3,000. London-based organization [Iran International](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601130145) says 12,000.

If the evidence from a clip posted Monday on X is any guide, that last estimate may very well be accurate. [The clip](https://x.com/fseifikaran/status/2010869013073612908?s=12), which is only six minutes long, appears to show “at least 262 instances of gunfire and sustained automatic shooting” fired on protesters in Tehran. And if 12,000 is indeed the true death toll, it means that in the span of just a few days, the regime has murdered at least *four times* as many people as were killed during the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Given the internet and phone blackout imposed across the country, it is impossible to know the full extent of the toll the protesters have incurred thus far. Yet the news trickling out—primarily from medical professionals whose clinics and hospitals have been overrun by wounded protesters—paints a terrifying picture. One doctor, who treated the injured for days before fleeing Iran, gave an interview [describing his experience](https://iranhumanrights.org/2026/01/exclusive-interview-physician-treating-protesters-in-iran-describes-mass-casualties-overwhelmed-hospitals/). His quotations are harrowing: “The trauma cases I saw were brutal, shoot-to-kill”; “This was treated as a wartime situation—go and suppress by any means”; “You did not need to be a protester to be shot. You could just be passing by.”

The doctor realized the regime’s rapidly escalating response through the stark change in the nature of the wounds he treated. In the early days of the uprising, which began on December 28, 2025, riot police were largely in charge of the streets, and most patients arriving at the hospital had suffered pellet wounds. But in the first couple of days of the new year, members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps joined the crackdown. And by January 8, the injuries were far more severe. Patients were arriving with wounds from live ammunition—bullets fired from Kalashnikovs and machine guns. They were no longer facing police attempting to disperse crowds, but members of the IRGC waging war against them.

“The trauma cases I saw were brutal, shoot-to-kill”; “This was treated as a wartime situation—go and suppress by any means.”  
—an Iranian doctor

The doctor’s account aligns with a broader shift in the regime’s tone and narrative. In the early days of the uprising, Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian struck a conciliatory note, taking to the airwaves to [express sympathy](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251230-iran-s-president-urges-government-to-listen-to-protesters-legitimate-demands) with protesters for the hardships they were enduring. He called their economic demands legitimate and invited them to dialogue. On January 4, he even offered a monthly [individual subsidy](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/iran-monthly-payment-citizens-protests-economic-crisis-13966047.html) of $7—enough to buy two pizzas in Tehran—to help the public cope with economic hardships exacerbated by the plummeting value of the Iranian rial.

But as protests persisted and crowds swelled across the country, the president’s tone shifted, signaling the growing impatience of the person who truly holds power in Iran: Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

On January 9, Khamenei delivered the kind of ominous speech he lives to give—one filled with threats and apocalyptic rhetoric. “A handful of vandals took to the streets of Tehran last night,” [he declared](https://www.middle-east-online.com/en/khamenei-brands-protesters-%E2%80%98vandals%E2%80%99-accusing-them-serving-us), “destroying the buildings of their own homeland in order to please America’s president.” In his characteristically hyperbolic fashion, he added that the Islamic Republic, “established with the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of honorable people,” would not back down in the face of those causing destruction. Khamenei’s exaggeration of the death toll of the 1979 Revolution was not merely rhetorical. It was a declaration of war.

A cadre of senior officials quickly fell in line. At a meeting of the Supreme Judicial Council, judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Eje’i [urged judges](https://x.com/dw_persian/status/2010702149181645137?s=20) to exact “blood revenge” on the protesters, who he called “terrorists.” Around the same time, Seda va Sima, Iran’s state-run radio and television network, aired footage from a morgue showing dozens of black body bags strewn across the floor. A [morgue worker](https://x.com/tohid__javadi/status/2010316723958776142?s=20) commented that while some of the dead belonged to armed opposition groups, “the majority of the rest were, in fact, ordinary people.”

To openly broadcast scenes of the decimation of innocent citizens is to announce that the proverbial gloves are off. The authorities were brazenly declaring that, in their exercise of brutality, they have dispensed with humane considerations—and not only when it comes to killing on the streets. So far, more than [10,000 protesters](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/iran-protests-01-11-26?post-id=cmkanyqwf00003b6q3v5yfepq) have been arrested, according to the official count. A [public hanging](https://x.com/ShahinModarres/status/2010571132949156117?s=20) —Tehran’s perennial instrument of public intimidation—will likely occur for one protester in the coming days.

The protests that have unfolded in Iran may appear unprecedented. Indeed, they are the largest and most widespread protests in Iran since 1979. But in fact, they follow a familiar script. In 1988, when the Islamic Republic was at one of its weakest moments—exhausted by an eight-year war with Iraq—it carried out a [massacre of political prisoners](https://iran1988.org/1988-massacre/) to preempt dissent. Over the course of a few weeks, thousands of prisoners were subjected to summary trials consisting of a handful of yes or no questions about their beliefs in Islam and the Islamic Republic. Those who answered *no* to a single question were sent to the gallows. Even the most conservative estimates suggest that [roughly 30,000](https://www.ncr-iran.org/en/1988-massacre-of-political-prisoners-in-iran/) political prisoners were massacred that summer. Mass killing, the regime concluded at the time, was an effective cure for an existential threat.

The protesters represent the gravest existential challenge the Iranian regime has ever faced.

Iran now stands at the threshold of a similar response. The Iranian regime has suffered a humiliating war that has weakened it more than at any point since its modern founding 47 years ago. The protesters represent the [gravest existential challenge](https://www.thefp.com/p/fear-humiliation-and-trump-why-irans) it has ever faced. There is every reason to believe that the regime will once again reach for the same cure it has in the past.

That only increases the urgency of the global response. In recent months, senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, encouraged Iranians to take to the streets. Today, President Donald Trump [announced that](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115888317758045915) “HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” and called for protesters to “TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS” and “KEEP PROTESTING.”

To be sure, Iranians—who have repeatedly protested and sacrificed their lives in hopes of overthrowing the regime—required no instructions from abroad to rise up again. Still, Israeli expressions of support, coupled with President Trump’s warnings that the United States is “ [locked and loaded](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-warns-us-locked-loaded-iran-kills-peaceful/story?id=128845602) ” and prepared to come to the protesters’ aid, created a sense of safety unlike any other moment in the past.

But if unarmed protesters are left alone to face a military that has proven its instinct to slaughter its own people by the thousands, then both Israel and the United States will confirm the very narratives the clerics have long promoted: Western powers speak loudly of solidarity, but will ultimately abandon those who respond to their call to action. As the doctor’s letter read: “If anyone is going to help us, even tomorrow may be too late.”
