Pío Pico, California's last governor under Mexican rule, was of mixed Spanish, Native American, and African ancestry

The **history of African Americans in Los Angeles** includes participation in the culture, education, and politics of the city of [Los Angeles, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California "Los Angeles, California"), United States.

The first blacks in Los Angeles were [mulattos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulattos "Mulattos") and [Afro-Mexicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Mexicans "Afro-Mexicans") who immigrated to California from [Sinaloa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinaloa "Sinaloa") and [Sonora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora "Sonora") in northwestern Mexico.[^1]

Contributions to the city’s culture have particularly been in music, dance, visual arts, stage, and film.

African Americans are concentrated in [South Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Los_Angeles "South Los Angeles"); as well as a Black community in suburban cities such as [Compton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_CA "Compton, CA") and [Inglewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_CA "Inglewood, CA"). There are sizable African immigrant communities in Greater Los Angeles. There is also a [Louisiana Creole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Creoles "Louisiana Creoles") community in Los Angeles County.[^2] There is an Ethiopian and Eritrean community in [Little Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ethiopia,_Los_Angeles "Little Ethiopia, Los Angeles").[^3] Some are [Afro-Latino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Latino "Afro-Latino") people from Central and South American countries, especially [Garifuna American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garifuna_American "Garifuna American") people. Many were born in [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria "Nigeria"), [Eritrea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea "Eritrea"), [Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia "Ethiopia"), [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia "Somalia"), [Belize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize "Belize"), [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras"), [Panama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama "Panama"), and [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana "Ghana").[^4]

The Black population in Los Angeles has declined since 2017, due to gentrification and more Latinos such as Mexicans and Central Americans moving to their neighborhoods.[^5] Many blacks leaving Los Angeles and also California moved to cities in the [Southern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States"), including [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta"), [Charlotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina "Charlotte, North Carolina"), [Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas "Dallas"), [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston "Houston"), [Little Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock "Little Rock"), [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans "New Orleans"), and [San Antonio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio "San Antonio").[^6] [^7] [^8] Including partly Black people, Los Angeles proper is 10% Black (estimated 385,000 residents in 2021).[^9] Many African Americans have become [homeless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness "Homelessness") in the city. African Americans make up 34% of Los Angeles's [homeless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness "Homelessness"), while only being 8% of the city's population in 2020.[^10]

Blacks in Los Angeles have a lower life expectancy and die younger than other racial groups in Los Angeles.[^11]

Los Angeles also has a sizable Black immigrant population. Los Angeles has the largest [Ethiopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Americans "Ethiopian Americans") population in the United States after [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."). 45,000 Ethiopians live in the Los Angeles area. 6,000 [Eritreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean_Americans "Eritrean Americans") live in Los Angeles.[^12]

## History

[Tongva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongva "Tongva") people inhabited the area before the arrival of European colonists and African slaves.[^13]

In 1781, the [early non-Indian settlers in Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Pobladores "Los Angeles Pobladores") (or 'Los Angeles Pobladores') included upwards of two dozen [Afro-Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Spanish "Afro-Spanish") individuals from the Spanish colonies in California (part of [New Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain "New Spain")).[^14] [^15]

[Pío Pico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%ADo_Pico "Pío Pico"), California's last governor under Mexican rule, was of mixed Spanish, Native American, and African ancestry.[^16] Pico spent his last days in Los Angeles dying in 1894 at the home of his daughter Joaquina Pico Moreno in Los Angeles. He was buried in the old [Calvary Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvary_Cemetery_\(Los_Angeles\)#Old_Calvary "Calvary Cemetery (Los Angeles)") in downtown Los Angeles. His brothers and their descendants were also early influencers in the same era.

### 19th century

Many [white Southerners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Southerners "White Southerners") who came to California during the [Gold Rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush "California Gold Rush") brought [racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States "Racism in the United States") attitudes and ideals with them. In 1850, twelve black people were registered as residents of Los Angeles. Because many blacks were enslaved until the abolition of slavery occurred in 1865, few blacks migrated to Los Angeles before then. Due to the construction of the [Santa Fe Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Railroad "Santa Fe Railroad") and a settlement increase in 1880, increasing numbers of blacks came to Los Angeles. By 1900, 2,131 African Americans, the second largest black population in California, lived in Los Angeles.[^17]

In 1872, the [First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_African_Methodist_Episcopal_Church_of_Los_Angeles "First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles") (First A.M.E. or FAME) was established under the sponsorship of [Biddy Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biddy_Mason "Biddy Mason"), an African American nurse and a California real estate entrepreneur and philanthropist, and her son-in-law Charles Owens. The church now has a membership of more than 19,000 individuals.

### 20th century

Between the 1890s and 1910, African Americans migrated to Los Angeles from Southern places like [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), [Shreveport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreveport "Shreveport"), [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta"), and [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans "New Orleans") to escape the racial violence, racism, white supremacy, and bigotry of the [Southern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States").[^18] The presence of the [first transcontinental railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_railroad "First transcontinental railroad") meant that Los Angeles had a relatively high African American population for a city in the Western United States; in 1910 it had 7,599 African Americans.[^19] The first branch of the [NAACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP "NAACP") in California was established in Los Angeles in 1913. Housing segregation was a common practice in the early 20th century. Many private property deeds explicitly banned owners from selling to anyone but [whites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people "White people").[^20]

The African American population did not significantly increase during the first [Great Migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_\(African_American\) "Great Migration (African American)").[^21] From approximately 1920 to 1955, [Central Avenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Avenue_\(Los_Angeles\) "Central Avenue (Los Angeles)") was the heart of the African American community in Los Angeles, with active rhythm and blues and jazz music scenes.[^22] [^23]

Central Avenue had two all-black segregated fire stations. [Fire Station No. 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Station_No._30,_Engine_Company_No._30 "Fire Station No. 30, Engine Company No. 30") and [Fire Station No. 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Station_No._14_\(Los_Angeles\) "Fire Station No. 14 (Los Angeles)") were segregated in 1924. They remained segregated until 1956 when the [Los Angeles Fire Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Fire_Department "Los Angeles Fire Department") was integrated. The listing on the National Register notes, "All-black fire stations were simultaneous representations of [racial segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States "Racial segregation in the United States") and sources of community pride." [^24] In 1928, [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") veteran [William J. Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Powell "William J. Powell") founded the Bessie Coleman Aero Club. In 1931, Powell organized the first all-black air show in the United States for the Club in Los Angeles, an event that drew 15,000 visitors. Powell also established a school to train mechanics and pilots.

[World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") brought the [Second Great Migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Migration_\(African_American\) "Second Great Migration (African American)"), tens of thousands of African American migrants, mostly from [Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana "Louisiana"), [Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi "Mississippi"), [Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas "Arkansas"), and [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), who left segregated Southern states in search of better opportunities in California. The African American population significantly increased in the [Second Great Migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Migration "Second Great Migration") of the 1940s as area factories received labor for the effort in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). In 1940 the black population was 63,700.[^21]

Areas in Los Angeles that were once predominantly white, such as South Central Los Angeles, Watts, and Compton became predominantly African American after the [white flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight "White flight").[^25]

[William Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Parker_\(police_officer\) "William H. Parker (police officer)") became police chief in 1952. He largely refused to hire black police officers. During most of his tenure, those already on the force were prohibited from having white partners.[^26]

The 1965 [Watts Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Riots "Watts Riots") were triggered by the arrest of a 21-year-old black man named Marquette Frye at 116th Street and Avalon Boulevard for driving drunk. A torrent of built-up rage erupted in the streets of Watts and [South Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Los_Angeles "South Los Angeles"). An investigating commission found that the African American citizens had been denied respect and endured substandard housing, education and medical care. The [King-Drew Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Multi-Service_Ambulatory_Care_Center "Martin Luther King, Jr. Multi-Service Ambulatory Care Center") in [Willowbrook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willowbrook,_California "Willowbrook, California") opened in 1972 as a response to the area having inadequate and insufficient hospital facilities.[^27]

In 1972, [Wattstax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattstax "Wattstax"), also known as the Black-Woodstock, took place in the [Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"). Over 100,000 black residents of Los Angeles attended this concert for African American pride. Later, in 1973, a documentary was released about the concert.

In 1973, [Tom Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bradley_\(American_politician\) "Tom Bradley (American politician)") was elected as [Mayor of Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles "Mayor of Los Angeles"), a role he'd hold for 20 years. L.A.'s first African American mayor, Bradley served over five terms, prior to the establishment of successive term limits, making him the longest-serving mayor of Los Angeles.[^28]

In 1991, [Rodney King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King "Rodney King") was beaten by police officers. His videotaped beating was controversial, and heightened racial tensions in Los Angeles.[^29] Just 13 days after the videotaped beating of King, a 15-year-old African American girl named [Latasha Harlins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Latasha_Harlins "Killing of Latasha Harlins") was shot and killed by a 51-year-old [Korean American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Americans "Korean Americans") store owner named Soon Ja Du after being falsely accused of stealing in a store. A jury found Du guilty of voluntary manslaughter, an offense that carries a maximum prison sentence of 16-years. However, trial judge, [Joyce Karlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Karlin_Fahey "Joyce Karlin Fahey"), sentenced Du five years of probation, four hundred hours of community service, and a $500 fine. The lenient response by the courts over the murder was one of the contributing factors to the 1992 Los Angeles riots.[^30] When four Los Angeles Police Department officers were acquitted of charges associated with the beating of Rodney King, the decision led to the [1992 Los Angeles riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots "1992 Los Angeles riots").[^29]

The trial of the [O. J. Simpson murder case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case "O. J. Simpson murder case") took place in 1994 and 1995.[^31]

### 21st century

In 2004, singer-songwriter [Ray Charles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Charles "Ray Charles") 's music studio on Washington Blvd. was declared a historic landmark.[^32]

Many African Americans in Los Angeles live in [poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty "Poverty") in 2019.[^33] In 2020, 34% of [homeless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness "Homelessness") people in Los Angeles are African Americans despite being only 8% of the population.[^34]

In 2021, African Americans in Los Angeles County were more at risk for [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19").[^35] [^36] In the 2021, African Americans in Los Angeles had the highest [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") hospitalization rate, as well as one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates.[^37]

Philip Garcia, a population specialist and the assistant director of institutional research for [California State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University "California State University"), stated that a group of communities in [South Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Los_Angeles "South Los Angeles") became African American by the 1950s and 1960s. These communities were Avalon, [Baldwin Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_Hills,_Los_Angeles "Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles"),[^38] Central, [Exposition Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_Park_\(Los_Angeles_neighborhood\) "Exposition Park (Los Angeles neighborhood)"), Santa Barbara, South Vermont, [Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts,_Los_Angeles "Watts, Los Angeles"), and [West Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Adams,_Los_Angeles "West Adams, Los Angeles"). Since then the Santa Barbara street was renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.[^39] 98,685 blacks moved to Los Angeles in the period 1965 through 1970. During the same period 40,776 blacks moved out.[^40]

In 1970, there were 763,000 African Americans in Los Angeles.[^21] They were the second largest minority group after the then estimated 815,000 [Mexican Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Americans "Mexican Americans"). Los Angeles had the west coast's largest black population. Between 1975 and 1980, 96,833 blacks moved to Los Angeles while 73,316 blacks left Los Angeles. Over 5,000 of the blacks moved to the [Riverside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside,_California "Riverside, California") - [San Bernardino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Bernardino,_California "San Bernardino, California") - [Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario,_California "Ontario, California") area. About 2,000 to 5,000 blacks moved to the [Anaheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California "Anaheim, California") - [Santa Ana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana,_California "Santa Ana, California") - [Garden Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Grove,_California "Garden Grove, California") area. James H. Johnson, a [University of California-Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California-Los_Angeles "University of California-Los Angeles") (UCLA) associate professor of geography, stated that due to affordable housing, blacks tend to choose "what is called the balance of the counties" or cities neutral to the existing major cities.[^40] In the Inland Empire, blacks tended to move to [Rialto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto,_California "Rialto, California") instead of Riverside and San Bernardino.[^40]

Of the blacks who left the City of Los Angeles between 1975 and 1980 who moved away from the Los Angeles area, over 5,000 moved to the [Oakland, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California "Oakland, California") area, about 2,000–5,000 went to [San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego "San Diego"), about 1,000–2,000 went to [Sacramento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento "Sacramento"), and about 1,000 to 2,000 went to [San Jose, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California "San Jose, California"). About 500-1,000 blacks moved to [Fresno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California "Fresno, California"), [Oxnard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California "Oxnard, California"), [Santa Barbara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California "Santa Barbara, California"), [Simi Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simi_Valley,_California "Simi Valley, California"), and [Ventura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California "Ventura, California"). Johnson stated that the areas from Fresno to Ventura are "areas that traditionally blacks haven't settled in".[^40] Many blacks leaving Los Angeles who also California moved to cities in the [U.S. South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States"), including [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta"), [Charlotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina "Charlotte, North Carolina"), [Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas "Dallas"), [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston "Houston"), [Little Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock "Little Rock"), [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans "New Orleans"), and [San Antonio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio "San Antonio"). Other cities receiving Los Angeles blacks include [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago"), [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), and [Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas "Las Vegas").[^40]

### 1990s

In the late 1990s, many African Americans moved away from the traditional African Americans neighborhoods, which overall reduced the black population of the City of Los Angeles and [Los Angeles County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County "Los Angeles County"). Many African Americans moved to eastern Los Angeles suburbs in [Riverside County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_County,_California "Riverside County, California") and [San Bernardino County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Bernardino_County,_California "San Bernardino County, California") in the [Inland Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire "Inland Empire"), such as [Moreno Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreno_Valley "Moreno Valley").[^41] From 1980 to 1990 the Inland Empire had the United States' fastest-growing black population. Between the [1980 U.S. Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_U.S._Census "1980 U.S. Census") and the [1990 U.S. Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_U.S._Census "1990 U.S. Census"), the black population increased by 119%. As of 1990 the Inland Empire had 169,128 black people.[^42]

Many new African American businesses appear in the Inland Empire, and many of these businesses have not been previously established elsewhere. The Inland Empire African American Chamber of Commerce began with six members in 1990 and the membership increased to 90 by 1996. According to Denise Hamilton of the *[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")*, as of 1996 "there has been no large-scale migration from the traditional black business districts such as [Crenshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crenshaw,_Los_Angeles "Crenshaw, Los Angeles"), black business people say." [^42] During the 1990s, the black population of the Moreno Valley increased by 27,500,[^41] and by 1996 13% of Moreno Valley was African American.[^42]

In the 1990s many African Americans moved to cities and areas in north Los Angeles County such as [Palmdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmdale,_California "Palmdale, California") and [Lancaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_California "Lancaster, California") and closer-in cities in Los Angeles County such as [Hawthorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne,_California "Hawthorne, California") and [Long Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California "Long Beach, California"). In the 1990s, the black population of Long Beach increased by 66,800.[^41]

In the 2019 census, 8% of the Los Angeles County population identified as black or African American.[^43]

In the 2000s, new black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and the Americas have arrived in Los Angeles. Nigerians, Ethiopians, Ghanaians, Belizeans, Jamaicans, Haitians, and Trinidadians are clustered in African American neighborhoods in Los Angeles.[^44] In 2001, within the Los Angeles metropolitan area, [Compton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California "Compton, California"), [Ladera Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladera_Heights,_California "Ladera Heights, California"), and [View Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_Park,_California "View Park, California") had the highest concentration of blacks. The cities of [Malibu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California "Malibu, California") and [Newport Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Beach,_California "Newport Beach, California") have the lowest concentrations of blacks. As of 2001, in the majority of cities within [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County "Los Angeles County"), [Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California "Orange County, California"), [Riverside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_County,_California "Riverside County, California"), [San Bernardino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Bernardino_County,_California "San Bernardino County, California"), and [Ventura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura_County,_California "Ventura County, California") counties had black populations below 10%.[^41] From 1990 to 2010 the population of Compton, previously African-American, changed to being about 66% Latino and Hispanic.[^45] The Black percentage of the population has declined in Los Angeles in 2017, possibly due to an increase of [Mexican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico") and [Central American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America") immigrants.[^46]

African Americans in Los Angeles have contributed to [gangsta rap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangsta_rap "Gangsta rap"), particularly in the early years between 1988 until 1992.[^49] African Americans influenced [West Coast hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop "West Coast hip hop") with African American rappers such as [Ice Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube "Ice Cube") and [Dr. Dre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre "Dr. Dre").[^50]

There are black-owned [soul food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_food "Soul food") restaurants in Los Angeles.

There is a [black Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Muslims "African-American Muslims") community in Los Angeles, and Islam has had a large influence on the African American population in California. African American make up around 15% of mosque attendants in Southern California in 2021.[^51]

There is many [graffiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti "Graffiti") murals dedicated to African Americans in the city such as the Crenshaw Wall located in [Destination Crenshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destination_Crenshaw "Destination Crenshaw"), an open-air African American museum.[^52]

There is also a Garifuna museum in the city.[^53]

### Gangs

[Restrictive covenants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictive_covenants "Restrictive covenants") in the 1920's forced Blacks into specific areas of LA, leading to overcrowding and housing congestion, especially in the Central Avenue area. Blacks of the time fought back against these discriminatory pieces of legislation, which led to strife that ensued between Whites and Blacks. White gangs at the time, such as the *[Spook Hunters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook_Hunters "Spook Hunters"),* attacked Black youth in the neighborhoods and communities that surrounded them. Raymond White was one of the original founders of the Black club the *Businessmen.* He proclaimed that it was almost impossible to pass by Alameda Blvd at the time because the White gangs would always be there waiting for them.[^54]

Police officers arrest a Black man during the Watts Rebellion, a week long uprising against the racist practices displayed by the Los Angeles Police Department at the time.

Black gangs first made an appearance in the late 20's and early 30's on the Eastside of Los Angeles, around the Central and Vernon Avenues near [Jefferson High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_High_School_\(Los_Angeles\) "Jefferson High School (Los Angeles)"). The Blacks gangs that formed during this time were aimed at protecting Black communities and defending them against attacks from White gangs. During the mid 40's, more African American gangs began to rise. Some of the gangs gave themselves distinctive names such as "Purple Hearts" and others go by the name of the street they represented.[^55] Although these gangs were making an appearance, the two gangs that became most notable that are still very big today, are the [Crips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crips "Crips") and [Bloods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloods "Bloods"), both of which trace their origins back to the 1960s.[^56]

White gangs eventually started fading from the LA area in the 1960's, and the Black gangs that were initially created to protect Black communities ended up turning against their own brethren. The [Watts Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_riots "Watts riots") in 1965 was the nail in the coffin that put an end to most Black gang on Black gang violence, and many gangs ended up siding with one another taking political stances against police brutality, as displayed in [The Watts Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_riots "Watts riots").[^54]

In 2007, 4% of African American adults in Los Angeles County identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual.[^57]

Most Black LGBTQIA+ persons live in Black neighborhoods. Of black LGBTQ+ persons, 38% lived in [South Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Los_Angeles "South Los Angeles"), 33% lived in the [South Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bay,_Los_Angeles "South Bay, Los Angeles"), and less than 1% lived in the [Los Angeles Westside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Westside "Los Angeles Westside"). Mignon R. Moore, the author of "Black and Gay in L.A.: The Relationships Black Lesbians and Gay Men Have to Their Racial and Religious Communities," wrote that black LGBTQ+ people had a tendency to not have openness about their sexuality and to not discuss their sexuality, and also that "they were not a visible group in neighborhoods like [Carson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California "Carson, California") and [Ladera Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladera_Heights "Ladera Heights") ".[^57]

## Little Ethiopia

Little Ethiopia is home to the third largest [Ethiopian American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Americans "Ethiopian Americans") after [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Little Ethiopia is the only area in the city to recognize the culture of the African continent.[^58] There are many Ethiopian restaurants in the neighborhood, serving [Ethiopian cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_cuisine "Ethiopian cuisine").[^59]

## Discrimination

Blacks in Los Angeles County are often affected by homelessness, poverty and incarceration due to discrimination. Anti-black hate crimes increased in Los Angeles in 2023.[^60] African Americans in Los Angeles are also more likely to be killed by police officers; with African Americans representing 24% of law enforcement killings, from 2000 to 2023.[^61] Racial violence against black women in Los Angeles remains high.[^62]

## Gentrification

African American neighborhoods in South Los Angeles have been gentrified. Many Latinos have moved to their historical neighborhoods.[^63]

## Suburbs

African Americans have faced significant challenges when attempting to integrate into predominantly white suburban areas. Following 1960, they began to establish a presence in a limited number of suburbs, which triggered a rapid exodus of white residents during the [white flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight "White flight") from places such as Compton and later Inglewood. However, there were notable exceptions for suburbs including [Pasadena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California "Pasadena, California"), [Monrovia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monrovia,_California "Monrovia, California"), and [Pacoima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacoima,_Los_Angeles "Pacoima, Los Angeles"), where black communities had established longstanding historical ties. After 1980, the movement of African Americans into suburban regions increased, with many residing alongside Hispanic populations in emerging majority-minority suburbs such as Compton, Inglewood, [Hawthorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne,_California "Hawthorne, California"), [Carson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California "Carson, California") and [Gardenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardena,_California "Gardena, California").[^64]
