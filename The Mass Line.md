I've been thinking about this tweet a lot, because Lindsay is pointing out something everyone really must know about. This concept was difficult for me to grasp prior to Lindsay explaining it over the years in talks and the NewDiscourses podcast. 

I've been trying to think about how to explain this to someone in the simplest terms possible to help others see what’s really going on, and here's what I have: 
1. Communists pick a target **(Mass Line)** 
2. Communists spread disinformation and propaganda, setup covert operations, and astroturf, etc. **(Active Measures)** 
3. Communists directly confront and engage their target, seeking immediate goals, which ultimately boil down to destroying something and giving the communists more power, either politically, culturally, or materially **(Direct Action)** 


So, to Lindsay’s point: Communists pick the cause they are pretending to care about – the “mass line” – which, in this case, is “Palestine” and “divestment from Israel.” The people running the show don’t really care about this issue, or at least don’t necessarily need to. The issue is never the issue; the issue is always the revolution. The real target is the Constitution and the current socio-economic political order, always. Think of the “mass line” as a road the communists construct to funnel the masses into direct confrontation with the target. 

The road needs travelers, so “active measures” are deployed to brainwash people, primarily through social and emotional carrots and sticks, into stepping onto the path that leads to the target. The goal is to use covert operations, shady funding, astroturfed support, political and cyber warfare, and whatever propaganda and disinformation is necessary to radicalize people and get them into the “mass line.” 

Once the road is full and the radicalized mass is moving, communists agitate, using “beautiful trouble” to place their targets into “decision dilemmas” and fool them into taking an action that can then be propagandized to garner popular support for the communists, thus bringing a critical mass of people into the “mass line.” 

None of this is new. Communists have been doing this forever. Unsuspecting people are brainwashed into what they think is a "spontaneous" movement, and soon find themselves directly confronting a target without really knowing that everything has been orchestrated in advance. 

Don't find yourself in the mass line. Watch out for active measures. "Direct action" is communist activism.
