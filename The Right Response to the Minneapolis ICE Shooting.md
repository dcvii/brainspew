A fatal shooting in Minneapolis on Wednesday launched an immediate information war, in which politicians drew lines and exchanged accusations long before they knew the facts. From President Donald Trump down to Mayor Jacob Frey, the supposed authorities showed little interest in learning what happened and guiding the public with sound conclusions.

Details of the shooting were reported piecemeal Wednesday. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen who had blocked a group of officers.

By the afternoon, several videos emerged that show the fatal moment. What the footage shows is this: While one officer stood by the driver’s side window, Good turned the vehicle to the right and accelerated. With the front-left side of the car, she appeared to bump another officer who had been standing in front of the hood. The second officer fired several shots, which fatally wounded Good and sent her crashing into cars parked along the side of a residential street.

The videos leave room for reasonable debate about the nature of the incident and who was at fault. It isn’t clear whether Good intended to strike the officer when she turned her vehicle, or if she meant to steer beyond him and accelerate away. “This is the type of shooting that happens a lot,” [wrote journalist Wesley Lowery](https://x.com/WesleyLowery/status/2008982839858221385) on X. “An officer, on foot, trying to stop or detain the driver of a vehicle who is leaving—resulting in the officer moving in front of the vehicle, becoming afraid they’ll get hit or run over and then opening fire.” Good’s decision to accelerate cost her life, but viewers can disagree in good faith about her motive to do so. They can also reasonably disagree about the agent’s decision to open fire.

The task of sorting through and weighing ambiguous evidence belongs to police investigators, government commissions, judges, and jurors. Each step of their processes requires time and deliberation. While the investigations progress, elected officials and agency heads are expected to comment only on what’s known for certain, while reassuring the public and mourning the dead.

Unfortunately, too many politicians and senior bureaucrats have decided that they must react to every tragedy according to the speed and logic of the internet, which goads them to offer the most partisan take they can muster, as quickly as possible, lest the other side’s narrative sway the public first. They spread falsehoods and baseless conclusions with no apparent remorse.

Mayor Frey [set the ugly tone](https://youtu.be/72a9zj6lz4g?si=ZIxdnpZcFR3qG8bw&t=169) in a now-famous press conference. “I have a message for ICE,” he said after the shooting. “Get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite.” Minnesota governor Tim Walz [pinned the blame](https://youtu.be/62-vNt60hA8?si=phRdePSRWyh_N7Fs&t=11) on the Trump administration’s “dangerous, sensationalized operations,” which [he said were](https://youtu.be/62-vNt60hA8?si=tKpRz_5rLZZz637h&t=23) “designed to generate fear.”

The Trump administration rushed to the opposite conclusion. Leaving no room for doubt, President Trump [posted on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115855701696773990) that Good had “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer,” and lumped her in with the “Radical Left.”

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who is in charge of ICE and its response to the incident, did worse in her press conference than leap to conclusions. Her remarks distorted the basic facts of the episode in a way that stamped out any ambiguity. “They got stuck in the snow because of the adverse weather that is in Minneapolis,” she said. “They were attempting to push out their vehicle and a woman attacked them.” This isn’t so. There was little snow on the road, and it seemed to have nothing to do with the violence that unfolded. Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism.”

These omissions, overstatements, and distortions reflect the mood of the country, and specifically the debate over immigration enforcement. Walz referred to ICE last year as the “modern-day Gestapo,” while California governor [Gavin Newsom](https://deadline.com/2025/09/gavin-newsom-no-ice-masks-law-trump-jimmy-kimmel-1236551531/) and Chicago mayor [Brandon Johnson](https://x.com/Breaking911/status/1942675412829757609?s=20) have both smeared immigration officers as the “secret police.” Meanwhile, Noem isn’t alone in tarring a large segment of the left as terrorists. White House adviser Stephen Miller called anti-ICE protests last year an “ [insurrection](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-aide-calls-los-angeles-anti-ice-protests-an-insurrection-2025-06-07/) ” as the administration sent in the National Guard.

White House border czar Tom Homan is not typically known for restraint, but his remarks on Minneapolis demonstrated how public officials ought to handle shocking stories before facts are settled. “It would be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation,” Homan [told CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/border-czar-tom-homan-ice-minneapolis/) on Wednesday. “Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation.” He condemned Democrats who called the shooting a “murder,” saying the hurried conclusion could stoke violence against other agents.

Mistakes and distortions like those that followed Wednesday’s shooting are hard to avoid at a moment when so many public figures prejudge every news story. Partisans witness messy events like a rapid standoff-turned-shooting and instantly cram them into neat lines that confirm their worst impressions of their political opponents. There’s a large audience for the quick takes among the polarized public. But that doesn’t absolve officials of their responsibility to wait for the facts and state them clearly.
