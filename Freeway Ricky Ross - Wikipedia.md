**Ricky Donnell** " **Freeway Ricky** " **Ross** (born January 26, 1960) [^1] is an American author and former [drug lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_lord "Drug lord") best known for the drug empire he established in [Los Angeles, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles"), in the early to mid 1980s.[^2] He was sentenced to life in prison, though the sentence was shortened on appeal and Ross was released in 2009.[^3]

## Biography

Ross attended school at [Susan Miller Dorsey High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Miller_Dorsey_High_School "Susan Miller Dorsey High School") in [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles"). He played for the tennis team but was unable to get the [college tennis scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_scholarship "College scholarship") he aspired to because he was illiterate.[^4]

Ross has said that when he first saw [crack cocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine "Crack cocaine") as a teenager in 1979, he did not immediately believe it was a drug because it looked different from other drugs he had seen.[^5]

The nickname Freeway came from Ross owning properties along Los Angeles' Interstate 110, also known as the [Harbor Freeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor_Freeway "Harbor Freeway").[^6] According to an October 2013 *[Esquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_\(magazine\) "Esquire (magazine)")* magazine article, "Between 1982 and 1989, federal prosecutors estimated, Ross bought and resold several metric tons of cocaine," with Ross' gross revenue claimed to be more than $900 million (equivalent to $2.7 billion in 2024) and profits of almost $300 million ($1.145 billion in 2024).[^7] During the height of his drug dealing, Ross was said to have sold "$3 million in one day." [^8] According to the *[Oakland Tribune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Tribune "Oakland Tribune")*, "In the course of his rise, prosecutors estimate that Ross exported several tons of cocaine to New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and made more than $500 million between 1983 and 1984." [^9]

In 1996, Ross was sentenced to [life imprisonment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment "Life imprisonment") under the [three-strikes law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-strikes_law "Three-strikes law") after being convicted for purchasing more than 100  [kilograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") of cocaine from a federal agent in a sting operation. Later that year, a series of articles by journalist [Gary Webb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb "Gary Webb") in the *[San Jose Mercury News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_Mercury_News "San Jose Mercury News")* revealed a connection between one of Ross's cocaine sources, [Danilo Blandón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Bland%C3%B3n "Danilo Blandón"), and the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency") as part of the [Iran–Contra affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair "Iran–Contra affair").[^10] Having learned to read at the age of 28, during his first stint in prison, Ross spent much of his time behind bars studying the law. He eventually discovered a legal loophole that would lead to his release.[^7] Ross's case was brought to a [federal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") [court of appeals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_appeals "Court of appeals") which found that the three-strikes law had been erroneously applied and ordered that he be resentenced.[^11] His sentence was reduced to 20 years; he was released from [Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Correctional_Institution,_Texarkana "Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana") on September 29, 2009.[^12]

Ross was arrested in October 2015 on suspicion of possessing cash related to the sales of illegal drugs when police discovered $100,000 in his possession during a traffic stop.[^3] Ross later alleged that he had been [racially profiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_profiling "Racial profiling") and stated that he was carrying a large amount of cash for the purchase of a home.[^13] Charges were ultimately dropped, and Ross explained he had earned the cash from book sales and speaking fees.[^14]

## Cocaine business

### Cocaine introduction

Ross began his cocaine empire after his illiteracy prevented him from earning a tennis scholarship for college. He began spending time with an upholstery teacher at a Los Angeles community college who revealed he dealt cocaine and offered Ross a small amount to sell.[^15] Ross used his profit to purchase more cocaine to sell, expanding his small operation.[^16] Ross eventually began to ask for quantities to sell that exceeded what the teacher was willing to procure, so he turned to find a dealer.[^17]

The teacher referred Ross to his supplier, Ivan Arguellas, who offered to keep Ross supplied. Arguellas was able to provide larger quantities at a better price, and Ross quickly went from dealing in grams of cocaine to dealing in ounces.[^18] About eight months after becoming Ross's supplier, Arguellas was shot in the spine, resulting in months of hospitalization that forced him out of the cocaine business. His brother-in-law Henry Corrales took over the business, but was not enthusiastic about the trade and had failed to make any connections of his own to suppliers.[^19]

A [Nicaraguan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua "Nicaragua") exile and cocaine distributor named [Danilo Blandón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Danilo_Bland%C3%B3n "Oscar Danilo Blandón") was acquainted with Arguellas and Corrales, and although he did not know him personally, was impressed with the amount of cocaine that Ross was moving. Blandón offered to supply cocaine to Corrales to sell to Ross, for a fifty-fifty split of the profit.[^20] Eventually, Corrales lost his appetite for the cocaine business and retired, at which point Ross became a direct customer of Blandón.[^21]

Through his connection to Blandón, and Blandón's supplier Norwin Meneses Cantarero, Ross was able to purchase Nicaraguan cocaine at significantly reduced rates.[^22] Ross began selling cocaine at $10,000 per kilo, a price well below average, while also distributing it to the [Bloods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloods "Bloods") and [Crips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crips "Crips") street gangs. By 1982, Ross had received his moniker of "Freeway Ricky" and claimed to have sold up to US$3 million worth of cocaine per day, purchasing 1,000 pounds (454 kilos) of cocaine a week.[^8]

Ross initially invested most of his profits in houses and businesses, because he feared his mother would catch on to what he was doing if he started spending lavishly on himself. In a jailhouse interview with reporter Gary Webb, Ross said, "We were hiding our money from our mothers." [^23] He invested a portion of the proceeds from his drug dealing activities in [Anita Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Baker "Anita Baker") 's first album.

### Drug empire

With thousands of employees, Ross has said he operated drug sales not only in Los Angeles but in places across the country including [St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri "St. Louis, Missouri"), [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,_Louisiana "New Orleans, Louisiana"), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), [Kansas City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri "Kansas City, Missouri"), [Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma "Oklahoma"), [Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana "Indiana"), [Cincinnati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati,_Ohio "Cincinnati, Ohio"), [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina "North Carolina"), [South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina "South Carolina"), [Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland "Baltimore, Maryland"), [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio "Cleveland, Ohio"), and [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington "Seattle, Washington"). He has said that his most lucrative sales came from the [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio "Ohio") area. He made similar claims in a 1996 PBS interview.[^24]

Federal prosecutors estimated that between 1982 and 1989 Ross bought and resold several metric tons of cocaine. In 1980 dollars, his gross earnings were said to be in excess of $900 million – with a profit of nearly $300 million. As his distribution empire grew to include forty-two cities, the price he paid per kilo of powder cocaine dropped from as much as $60,000 to as low as $10,000." [^7]

Much of Ross's success at evading law enforcement was due to his ring's possession of police scanners and voice scramblers. Furthermore, journalist Gary Webb alleged that the CIA was sponsoring the operation as part of its effort to finance [Contras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras "Contras"), giving Ross another level of protection, although this claim has since been disputed.[^25] Following one drug bust, a Los Angeles County sheriff remarked that Ross's men had "better equipment than we have." [^26]

On June 18, 2010, Ross sued rapper [Rick Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross "Rick Ross") (real name William Leonard Roberts II) for using his name,[^27] filing a [copyright infringement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement "Copyright infringement") lawsuit against Ross in [Los Angeles County Superior Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Superior_Court "Los Angeles County Superior Court").[^27] [^28] [Jay-Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z "Jay-Z") had been called to testify in the lawsuit, as he was President of [Def Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam "Def Jam") when Ross was signed to the label.[^27] Ross sought $10 million in compensation in the lawsuit.[^27]

After the lawsuit was dismissed on July 3, 2010,[^29] the album *[Teflon Don](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teflon_Don_\(album\) "Teflon Don (album)")* was released as scheduled on July 20, 2010. A federal judge dismissed his case, ruling that it should be refiled in California state court because it fell under [California state law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_state_law "California state law").[^30] Ross refiled the case with the State of California, while appealing his federal case. A federal appeals upheld the dismissal in 2012.[^31]

The state case was filed in 2011 in California.

Ross refiled in Los Angeles Superior Court with publicity rights claims. Trial was set for early May 2012. The case was dismissed by a judge in the Los Angeles Superior Court.[^32]

The California State case was updated with a motion in Freeway Rick Ross's favor as to [Warner Bros. Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records "Warner Bros. Records") and their use of the name and image Rick Ross in July 2012.[^33]

A trial was set for August 27, 2013 in Freeway Rick Ross versus Rick Ross and [Warner Music Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group "Warner Music Group"). The California trial court ruled in favor of the rapper Rick Ross, allowing him to keep the name. In December 2013, a state appeals court upheld the ruling on [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "First Amendment to the United States Constitution") grounds.[^34] [^35]

## Other ventures

In January 2022, it was reported that Ross had established a boxing management company, *Team Freeway Boxing*, with four [professional boxers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxer "Professional boxer") under contract. Ross will also be acting in an advisory role for [light welterweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_welterweight "Light welterweight") contender [Anthony Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Peterson "Anthony Peterson").[^36]

In a June 2024, interview on *[The Joe Rogan Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joe_Rogan_Experience "The Joe Rogan Experience")* Ross stated he owns a marijuana dispensary.

## Book

Journalist and author [Cathy Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Scott "Cathy Scott") co-wrote Ross's autobiography with him. The memoir, *[Freeway Rick Ross: The Untold Autobiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway_Rick_Ross_\(book\) "Freeway Rick Ross (book)")*, was released at a book launch with author Scott at the [Eso Won Bookstore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eso_Won_Books "Eso Won Books") in Los Angeles on June 17, 2014 to a standing-room only crowd.[^37] [^38]

[KCET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCET "KCET") TV in its review wrote, "(The book) is fascinating for its unsentimental, inside look at his career on the streets of South Central, which started for Ross with car theft and quickly shifted to drugs and the big time." [^39]

The memoir was nominated for *ForeWord Review* ' s IndiFab Best Book of the Year Award 2014 in the [true crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime "True crime") category.[^40] In June 2015, winners were announced, with the book named as a Foreword Reviews' 2014 INDIEFAB Book of the Year Award Finalist, True Crime.[^41]

Ross was a key figure in filmmaker [Kevin Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Booth "Kevin Booth") 's documentary *[American Drug War: The Last White Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Drug_War:_The_Last_White_Hope "American Drug War: The Last White Hope")*. The second episode of the first season of [BET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Entertainment_Television "Black Entertainment Television") 's *[American Gangster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gangster_\(TV_series\) "American Gangster (TV series)")* documentary series was focused on the story of Ricky Ross and his connection to the [Iran–Contra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair "Iran–Contra affair") scandal.[^42]

Ross was a guest interview on [VH1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1 "VH1") 's Planet Rock History of Crack and Hip Hop Documentary.[^43]

Ross is featured in the 2015 two-part documentary *Freeway: Crack in the System*, which details various levels of the drug trade, the Iran–Contra affair, and mass incarceration.[^44] In 2016, the documentary was nominated for an [Emmy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy "Emmy") for Outstanding Investigative Journalism: Long Form.[^45]

In the 2014 film *[Kill the Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Messenger_\(2014_film\) "Kill the Messenger (2014 film)")*, Ross is portrayed by [Michael K. Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_K._Williams "Michael K. Williams").[^46]

Ross claims his lifestyle and cocaine business, as well as his suspected involvement in the [Iran-Contra Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair "Iran–Contra affair"), heavily influenced the fictional character Franklin Saint, the protagonist of the [FX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_Networks "FX Networks") crime drama television series *[Snowfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowfall_\(TV_series\) "Snowfall (TV series)").* Ross says he and the show's creator, [John Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singleton "John Singleton"), "partnered up to make a movie", but that Singleton "disappeared" before going on to make *Snowfall*. Singleton died in 2019 and never confirmed Ross' claims.[^47]

[The Coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coup "The Coup"), in their single *My Favorite Mutiny* talk about [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA") involvement in the rise of Ricky Ross.[^48]
