> Chemical hot packs (like Hot Hands hand warmers or Thermacare heat patches) are rated for a specific number of hours of heat. I believe the hand warmers are 10 hours and the larger Thermacare patches are 16.
> 
> The way these packs work is by a chemical reaction with oxygen. Which means you get 10 hours of heat for 10 hours of oxygen exposure but they don't have to be 10 *consecutive* hours.
> 
> If you only need them for a few hours, stick them in a zip-lock bag when you're done. They will cool off almost instantly and you still get several more hours of heat. You don't have to throw them away just because you don't need them right now.
> 
> Similarly, if your hot packs stop working early, it's almost certainly because they don't have enough oxygen. Take them out of your gloves/pockets/shoes for a moment, and they will warm back up!

But the stuff inside isn’t going to pollute the planet any worse than anything else. Please don’t just dump the contents on the ground, but at the same time I for one was surprised that the magic heating thingy was relatively benign.

> 
> 1. Waiting 3 minutes for something to cook in the microwave? Clean some of the kitchen in those 3 minutes.
> 2. Going from one area of the house to another? Carry things in that area to the area they are supposed to be at your destination. Dishes in the rec room? Carry them on the way to the kitchen. Bedroom trash full? Carry the bags on the way to the garage. Think about where you are, where you're going, and what is at where you are that needs to be taken to where you're going. Never make a trip from point A to point B without returning something to point B.
> 3. Keep cleaning supplies close to what you use them for. Don't store your kitchen cleaners hidden in the laundry room. Don't store the upstairs bathroom cleaners in a downstairs hall closet. Keep rolls of paper towels near anywhere a spill MIGHT occur: dining room, rec room, even bathroom, or in a bedside table.
> 4. Have more than one broom and dustpan, and keep one set in the kitchen, garage, etc. They are cheap.

Buy a roller screen that fits in the bucket. Pour some of the paint in the bucket and start rolling. Always also use a roller pole, don't hold that thing in your hand it's 10 times the work! Finally, when done, tap the roller cover into the paint, and put on the lid. You're ready to go tomorrow with only the roller frame to clean. Next day, insert end of roller frame into end of roller cover you left in the bucket with paint. Tap lightly on opposite end of roller frame, and cover will work it's way back onto frame. Hope this all makes sense, it is such a time and effort saver.
