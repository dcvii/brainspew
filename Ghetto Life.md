Oh let us do ghetto.

It’s going to take more than an hour.

Also I will pitch Black Fatigue as a simple class and cultural resentment that may be happening with more black middle class people in the context of the Declining Significance of Race. In other words, black racial unity is crumbling as it has been and now that idea is viral. Nothing new - just the Algorithm recognizing a new meme.

  

Premises:
  

1. Blackfolks specifically, and (peasants) in general, since the age of mass communications have not been in control of their public image. 
2. Class is more important than race.
3. Class differences within black America are real.
 - economic class (Wilson)
- social class (social capital) (Loury)

  

  

I’m going to talk about 

  

1. DuBois vs Washington vs Woodson

2.  My travels in work and going to the MLK Blvd in different cities. (Tampa)

3. The marriage race in Boston. (maybe)

4. Ghetto mentality vs Slave mentality
