The Deep State is in SHAMBLES.  
  
Tulsi Gabbard just made Obama GAG on his own Russia Collusion Hoax.  
  
CNN tried to censor the moment.  
  
But that didn’t stop her from dropping a NUKE, calling Obama’s ties to the scheme “IRREFUTABLE.”  
  
Then came a new bombshell:  
  
Turns out Putin held back CRIMINAL dirt on Hillary before the 2016 election.  
  
This was a wild press conference. Watch it all unfold.  
  
🧵 THREAD

It’s finally happening.  
  
After years of speculation, suppression, and denials from every corner of the establishment...the truth is coming to the surface.  
  
The declassified report is here.  
  
And it proves what many have suspected for years: President Obama wasn’t just aware of the Russia Hoax.  
  
He was behind it.  
  
What started as a standard White House press briefing, quickly evolved into a historic disclosure.  
  
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stepped aside and introduced Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.  
  
What followed was a controlled demolition of the official narrative.  
  
“At President Trump’s direction and with support from House Intel Chair Rick Crawford, today we released the declassified oversight majority staff report from September 2020.”  
  
Then came the nuke.  
  
“There is IRREFUTABLE evidence showing President Obama and his national security team knowingly created a false intelligence report to sell the narrative that Russia helped Trump win the 2016 election.”  
  
“They made it up. It wasn’t true.”  
  
Gabbard laid out the full scheme:  
  
“They used fake sources, suppressed real intel, and ignored standard tradecraft to push a lie.”  
  
“They conspired with the media to undermine President Trump and launched a years-long coup against his administration.”  
  
“This should concern every American. It’s not about party—it’s about our democracy.”  
  
This is the biggest political scandal in modern U.S. history.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948124619036073984/pl/zmvvMeOkE-Kmbgvv.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948124619036073984/vid/avc1/480x270/xRcuSf4NZy71qCAp.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948124619036073984/vid/avc1/640x360/IGT987BMJaVFaDDG.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948124619036073984/vid/avc1/1280x720/eT-2_Na-sP05KXbs.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948124619036073984/vid/avc1/1920x1080/acxFZNOoHIe1403S.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

That wasn’t conjecture.  
  
That was the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, standing in the White House, telling the American public that a sitting president weaponized the intelligence community to interfere in a presidential election—and take down his successor.  
  
The paper trail is now public.  
  
“We’re here today because the American people deserve the truth, they deserve accountability, and they deserve justice.”  
  
She outlined three separate data points now declassified and available for anyone to read: ODNI records, the DOJ’s “Clinton Annex,” and a full oversight report from the House Intelligence Committee.  
  
“All come back to and confirm the same thing.”  
  
“There was a gross politicization and manipulation of intelligence by the Obama administration, intended to delegitimize President Trump even before he was inaugurated, ultimately usurping the will of the American people.”  
  
And now, it’s all on the table for the American people to see.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948129369156628481/pl/-CgyletteRVVZFZy.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948129369156628481/vid/avc1/480x270/E8qtfMKFgHnIcUQ5.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948129369156628481/vid/avc1/1920x1080/c8J--7qhPy-1OVZU.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948129369156628481/vid/avc1/1280x720/cnQjYYwvL6iP7aZN.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948129369156628481/vid/avc1/640x360/9tmkcMlJET-FhJZ7.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

But Gabbard wasn’t finished.  
  
She turned next to Hillary Clinton.  
  
And to a revelation that changes the entire framing of 2016.  
  
Gabbard laid out how according to the report, Vladimir Putin withheld the most damaging material he had on Hillary Clinton....because he believed she was going to win.  
  
CRIMINAL material.  
  
“I’m going to go over the key findings from the House Intelligence report, which investigated the claims that were made by an intelligence community assessment ordered by President Obama and published in January of 2017.”  
  
“First, Putin’s principal interest relating to the 2016 election were to undermine faith in the U.S. Democratic election process, not show preference of a certain candidate.”  
  
“In fact, this report shows Putin held back from leaking compromising material on Hillary Clinton prior to the election, instead planning to release it after the election to weaken what Moscow viewed as an inevitable Clinton presidency.”  
  
But the real scandal wasn’t just what Putin had.  
  
It’s what the Obama administration did to hide it.  
  
“In the January 2017 intelligence assessment that president Obama ordered, John Brennan, who was CIA director at the time, and the intelligence community intentionally suppressed intelligence that showed Putin was saving the MOST damaging material he had in his possession about Hillary Clinton until after her potential and likely victory.”  
  
And the content of that dirt? Nothing short of explosive.  
  
“The report goes into great detail about the information Russia and Putin had on Hillary Clinton, which included possible criminal acts, like secret meetings with multiple named U.S. religious organizations, in which State Department officials offered in exchange for supporting Secretary Clinton’s campaign for the presidency, significant increases in financing from the State Department.”  
  
They had the information. They buried it.  
  
And they lied about what Russia’s intentions were.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948130316394053634/pl/kh8T49u9zThnCjnW.m3u8?v=857&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948130316394053634/vid/avc1/480x270/C_8jg4R9jX0Tscto.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948130316394053634/vid/avc1/1920x1080/aPK3_Vr-MxTdYs6V.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948130316394053634/vid/avc1/640x360/okfB_6JLzFWeNuUk.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948130316394053634/vid/avc1/1280x720/YvJcvlu1ToC_YIXz.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Right on cue, CNN punted with what could only be described as: damage control.  
  
Just as Gabbard began walking through the most critical conclusions...CNN cut the feed.  
  
She had just said:  
  
“Multiple intelligence community assessments released in the months leading up to the November 2016 election concluded that Russia had neither the intent, nor capability to impact the outcome of the U.S. election—”  
  
And then the she was muted as a network commentator was heard softening the blow:  
  
“We’ve been listening there to the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, continuing on what has now been a multi-day effort—to attempt to back up the… quite extreme allegation that President Obama is guilty of treason and that he worked in some sort of ‘conspiracy’ with Hillary Clinton, etc.”  
  
No debate. No context. Just the kill switch.  
  
The irony wasn’t lost on anyone watching: an intelligence official presenting newly declassified evidence...muted mid-sentence, while a TV anchor reframed her words as a “conspiracy.” <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948131291263541249/pl/aRRmEFp4w58ot5TO.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948131291263541249/vid/avc1/480x270/kXFDQETks1I9nbzd.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948131291263541249/vid/avc1/640x360/JiwXV15S4XwjgmsU.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948131291263541249/vid/avc1/1280x720/bRJkjD_j6ecq_GYw.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Back in the briefing room, Gabbard didn’t waver.  
  
She closed with a clear summary of what the public now had in front of them.  
  
This was a HISTORIC abuse of power and levels of corruption never before witnessed by the American people.  
  
“The implications of this are far-reaching and have to do with the integrity of our democratic republic.”  
  
“It has to do with an outgoing president taking action to manufacture intelligence, to undermine and usurp the will of the American people in that election, and launch what would be a year’s long coup against the incoming president of the United States, Donald Trump.”  
  
She finished simply: “Thank you.”  
  
This wasn’t Watergate.  
  
It was orders of magnitude beyond it.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948132379110916096/pl/JJ3e35s3uElTTslA.m3u8?v=062&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948132379110916096/vid/avc1/1920x1080/SbLAz9qu4Q1TfGAO.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948132379110916096/vid/avc1/640x360/Pd-aaxjGbCMDS9J6.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948132379110916096/vid/avc1/480x270/pm9-3hlaOS8R6BmJ.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948132379110916096/vid/avc1/1280x720/0snhlELU12mgGzDG.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

But there was one final moment. An epilogue if you will.  
  
A reporter asked what no one else in the room wanted to say out loud.  
  
“Do you believe that any of this new information implicates former president Obama in criminal behavior?”  
  
Gabbard didn’t blink.  
  
“We have referred and will continue to refer all of these documents to the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate the criminal implications of this.”  
  
“For even President Obama?”  
  
“Correct.”  
  
And then the final blow:  
  
“The evidence that we have found and that we have released directly point to President Obama LEADING the manufacturing of this intelligence assessment.”  
  
“There are multiple pieces of evidence and intelligence that confirm that fact.”  
  
It’s all out now. No more hiding. No more denials.  
  
The cat is officially out of the bag, and what comes from it?  
  
That is the million dollar question.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948133320090333184/pl/78huC4_KcMap80pJ.m3u8?v=322&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948133320090333184/vid/avc1/1920x1080/dt7vbPLC_MvbSzw6.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948133320090333184/vid/avc1/480x270/UHQsNGtHDzxgFNVr.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948133320090333184/vid/avc1/1280x720/5_0flVe1jRz-hBuG.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1948133320090333184/vid/avc1/640x360/Qci7eeiZs1bVKPZP.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

10 Shocking Stories the Media Buried Today  
  
#10 – CNN abruptly CUTS AWAY as Tulsi Gabbard exposes how far Obama went to create the Russia collusion hoax.  
  
They MUTED her mic and put words in her mouth. Unbelievable.  
  
Here’s what they didn't want you to hear:  
  
“Multiple intelligence community assessments released in the months leading up to the November 2016 election concluded that Russia had neither the INTENT nor CAPABILITY to impact the outcome of the US election. On December 5 of 2016, the FBI and ODNI gave the House Intelligence Committee its first post-election classified briefing in which there was no mention of Putin aspiring to elect Trump by either agency.  
  
“The Presidential Daily Brief drafted on December 8th of 2016 stated that NO Russian or criminal actors impacted vote counts. This document was pulled just hours before it was to be published due to quote, unquote, ‘new guidance.’ If it had been published, it would have been briefed to both President Obama and President-Elect Donald Trump.  
  
“On December 9, 2016, a National Security Council meeting was called to gather President Obama’s senior national security officials, which included CIA Director Brennan, then-Obama DNI James Clapper, Susan Rice, and others. Following that secret meeting, DNI Clapper’s assistant sent an email to the intelligence community with the subject line ‘POTUS Tasking on Russia Election Meddling.’  
  
“Tasking ODNI leaders to create a NEW assessment per the PRESIDENT’S request. The House Intelligence Committee Oversight Report that we released today reveals that, quote, ‘unlike routine intelligence community analysis, the intelligence community assessment was a high-profile product ORDERED by the President, PRESIDENT OBAMA.’  
  
“It directed senior intelligence community agency heads and created an intelligence community assessment limited to just FIVE analysts using ONE principal drafter. This is NOT SOMETHING that occurs in the normal path of producing an intelligence community assessment that reflects the views across the intelligence community.”  
  
No wonder CNN muted her mic.  
  
She just exposed how Obama handpicked analysts to craft a hoax—and sold it as fact to undermine Trump’s presidency for years.

#9 - Kevin O’Leary predicts CBS will soon FIRE Stephen Colbert instead of letting him finish out his contract.  
  
“Only a moron would tell the president to F off before he gets his check. So what’s going to happen now, in my opinion, is tomorrow CBS—his boss—will FIRE him, and they’ll litigate his payout for the next five years.”  
  
A guest jumped in and asked, “Fire who? Stephen Colbert?”  
  
“Absolutely,” O’Leary responded. “Get rid of this guy. If I were them, I’d whack this guy tomorrow.

Did you know a jury found pharma LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE for a man murdering his family?  
  
Donald Schell was prescribed Paxil. Just 48 hours later, he killed his wife, daughter, and granddaughter, then took his own life.  
  
The court ruled the DRUG was to blame.  
  
What happened next?  
  
The drug STAYED on the market. No major action was taken to pull it. And Paxil is still prescribed to this day.  
  
That’s how powerful Big Pharma is.  
  
Since SSRI antidepressants hit the market, mass shootings have surged across America.  
  
Could these drugs be to blame? They don’t want you to see this evidence.

Big Pharma gaslit the world for decades.  
  
They said SSRIs are the silver bullet. They said they didn’t cause psychotic violence. Mentally ill people were just already dangerous.  
  
But hidden clinical trial data, black-box warnings, and bone-chilling real-world cases tell a completely different story.  
  
The truth is, SSRIs are not just correlated with violence—they cause it.

10 Shocking Stories the Media Buried Today  
  
#10 - Trump says Barack Hussein Obama is GUILTY of TREASON and tried to steal the election.  
  
Trump’s remarks follow new declassified documents that he says prove Obama personally ordered an intelligence assessment with the intent to create a Russia-collusion narrative hoax.  
  
“If you look at those papers, they have him STONE COLD,” Trump said. “And it was President Obama.”  
  
He went on to declare, “It wasn’t lots of people all over the place. It was them, too, but the leader of the gang was President Obama. Barack Hussein Obama—have you heard of him?”  
  
Then he dropped the hammer: “He’s GUILTY. It’s not a question.”  
  
Calling the plot “TREASON,” Trump said, “They tried to steal the election. They tried to obfuscate the election. They did things that nobody has ever even imagined, even in other countries.”  
  
Trump is accusing a former president of masterminding an act of TREASON. This has to be the biggest political accusation in American history.

#9 - “Hillary Clinton had her staffers smash cell phones with hammers and use a program called BleachBit to destroy the records on a private server she was ordered to turn over.”  
  
Why isn’t the botched FBI investigation that kept Hillary Clinton out of jail the top story?

#8 – Jon Stewart brings out a gospel choir and curses like a sailor in a cringeworthy attempt to pose as a political dissident.  
  
@realchrisrufo writes, “This is precisely the kind of partisan, juvenile slop that led to Colbert's unprofitability and, in time, will lead Jon Stewart to the same place. ‘Yelling expletives at Trump with a gospel choir’ is not clever or entertaining.

TSUNAMI.  
  
Trump just crossed the Rubicon—and there’s NO going back.  
  
Inside the Oval Office, with cameras rolling, he accused Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton of orchestrating the Russia Hoax.  
  
Then he said it flat-out: Obama committed TREASON.  
  
But it’s what he revealed next that could blow the lid off the Deep State:  
  
“And we have ALL of the documents....and from what Tulsi told me, she’s got THOUSANDS of additional documents coming.”  
  
🧵 THREAD

The cameras were rolling for a routine Oval Office meeting with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos.  
  
Trade and international relations were on the agenda....until they weren’t.  
  
One question from the press turned the entire conversation upside down.  
  
A reporter brought up Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s investigation into political corruption and asked who should ultimately be held responsible.  
  
Trump didn’t hesitate. Not for one second. He dropped names.  
  
“Well, based on what I read, and I read pretty much what you read, it would be President Obama. He started it.”  
  
He named the rest of Obama’s band of corrupt miscreants.  
  
“And Biden was there with him and Comey was there and Clapper, the WHOLE group was there. Brennan, they were all there in a room.”  
  
Then Trump looked around the space:  
  
“Right here. This was the room.”  
  
The Oval Office....the very space where, Trump now claims, it all began.  
  
Kind of poetic if you think about it.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947736902032855043/pl/wvEVTetASnyu5ng7.m3u8?v=f94&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947736902032855043/vid/avc1/1280x720/dIig6PwYYAVqLgy5.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947736902032855043/vid/avc1/480x270/jAH7t68MbnVf22aU.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947736902032855043/vid/avc1/1920x1080/WX9s51jbv9pSNI7_.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947736902032855043/vid/avc1/640x360/BZf4-B5bwhLcPGPB.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

That’s when things took a HISTORIC turn.  
  
The Overton Window was about to be shattered.  
  
No more implications. No more code words.  
  
Trump said directly that Barack Obama was GUILTY of masterminding the Russia hoax...and called it what it was in his mind.  
  
“If you look at those papers, they have him STONE COLD.”  
  
“And it was President Obama.”  
  
“It wasn’t lots of people all over the place. It was them, too, but the leader of the gang was President Obama.”  
  
“Barack Hussein Obama, have you heard of him?”  
  
Then came the line that crossed every conventional boundary:  
  
“He’s guilty. It’s not a question.”  
  
“This was TREASON. This was...every word you can think of.”  
  
“They tried to steal the election. They tried to obfuscate the election.”  
  
“They did things that nobody has ever even imagined, even in other countries.”  
  
The president of the United States had just accused his predecessor of treason....from the same desk they both once sat behind.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947738226225004544/pl/ZzclX4OwLDrdTElt.m3u8?v=cfc&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947738226225004544/vid/avc1/640x360/OHFjq3OqsGC277Ji.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947738226225004544/vid/avc1/1280x720/kDr-eGQhRCyf791D.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947738226225004544/vid/avc1/480x270/udfpAi8nUbrdhPYD.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947738226225004544/vid/avc1/1920x1080/QxpXAzhDNMEckcwY.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

This was the FINAL straw.  
  
An illegal alien just shot a Border Patrol agent in the face.  
  
Now that agent is fighting for his life.  
  
The worst part?  
  
This violent offender had been released onto the streets FIVE TIMES before the attack.  
  
And the numbers are beyond TERRIFYING:  
  
Secretary Noem says violence against immigration officers is up over 830% in recent days.  
  
Now she and Tom Homan are vowing to take the fight directly to the source....Democrat-run sanctuary cities.  
  
🧵 THREAD

It’s a tough video to stomach.  
  
On Saturday, July 19, an off-duty CBP officer was ambushed in New York City’s Fort Washington Park by two illegal aliens from the Dominican Republic.  
  
The attempted robbery, caught on camera, shows the suspects approaching the officer on a moped.  
  
Without warning, 21-year-old Miguel Francisco Mora pulled a gun and shot the officer in the face and arm.  
  
Wounded but alert, the hero officer returned fire...hitting Mora in the chest.  
  
Both assailants fled on the moped, but Mora didn’t get far.  
  
Thanks to the officer’s quick response, he was later taken into custody while seeking treatment for his gunshot wound.  
  
The officer is expected to make it, thank God.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947342984413872128/pl/T8S_nBOi_KvpVXA1.m3u8?v=a8b&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947342984413872128/vid/avc1/484x270/H06MufWr70fvAvYI.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947342984413872128/vid/avc1/640x356/_tuFZl3BYDHLG5D1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The shooting was horrifying.  
  
But the more disturbing part was what was revealed after.  
  
At a press conference in New York City this morning, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the shooter was in the country illegally....and that the Biden administration had released him back into the public after detaining him in 2023.  
  
“We just recently in the last couple of days have had one of our own that has been attacked and has been harmed dangerously by violent criminals that have been run loose here in New York City but also in this country,” she said.  
  
“As a result of sanctuary city policies and the policies of the Biden administration.”  
  
According to Noem, the off-duty officer and his friend were simply walking when the attempted robbery began.  
  
Had the officer not been carrying his weapon, she said, the outcome could’ve been far worse.  
  
“They were attacked by two individuals that were set on robbing them and thankfully he had his service weapon with him and able to defend himself and his friend and injured one of those individuals that was trying to do them harm.”  
  
Then she dropped the detail that stunned the room.  
  
“One of the suspected attackers, the one that was injured, his name is Miguel Francisco Mora Nunez, a Dominican national that was entering into this country illegally back in 2023. He was then released back into this country by the Biden administration.” <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947344673309102081/pl/agyo_-1sGdHEMn7y.m3u8?v=491&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947344673309102081/vid/avc1/640x360/uFU-bBkDIsOFIRIk.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947344673309102081/vid/avc1/480x270/zc6dJlbp7Lm5FRCZ.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947344673309102081/vid/avc1/1280x720/9zKYT434_pkvZ-1S.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1947344673309102081/vid/avc1/1920x1080/SSy7q2yMd-AcQBvQ.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

This common drug can feel like a miracle in the doctor’s office, then turn into a nightmare after you leave.  
  
You throw out your back. The pain’s awful. And your doctor gives you a steroid shot.  
  
Boom—pain gone.  
  
But here’s what he didn’t tell you:  
  
That one shot could trigger weight gain, adrenal shutdown, bone loss, or something even worse.  
  
In fact, 90% of steroid users report side effects.  
  
Medical researcher @MidwesternDoc has seen how steroids quietly destroy health over time.  
  
Read this before your next appointment. It could save you from lasting harm.  
  
🧵 THREAD

First, let’s get one thing straight:  
  
Modern medicine isn’t the only system that’s ever existed—it just violently erased the others.  
  
What we now call “health care” is actually built on suppressing symptoms instead of healing the body.  
  
It isn’t really health care at all… And it’s a dangerous foundation.
