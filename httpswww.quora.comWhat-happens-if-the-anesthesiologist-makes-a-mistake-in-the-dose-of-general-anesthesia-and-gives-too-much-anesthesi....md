Some good answers here, but I wonder if what you’re worried about is this:

Some people think I administer a syringe full of something called “anaesthetic”, leave the room and hope it lasts long enough for the operation. It doesn’t work like that!

All anaesthetic drugs (there are many different ones, both IV and gaseous) are potent, but very short acting. We like them short acting so that we can get out of trouble as quickly as we got into trouble. There are many ways of doing it but 90% of anaesthetics involve giving an intravenous dose of an “induction agent”, typically propofol, which on its own would keep you asleep for about five minutes. Once asleep, we keep you asleep with gas, or more correctly a “volatile agent”, typically sevofluorane. You can put people to sleep with gas and you can keep people asleep with propofol, but I digress… You’ll also get a bunch of pain killers, anti-sickness drugs and maybe some antibiotics if the surgeon wants them and possibly something to aid blood clotting.

Calculation of doses of all these things is part science, part art. We obviously dose by weight; large people are going to need a lot more than children, but some are better dosed by height. Often, you have to take into account how much of someone is fat or muscle, so two people of the same weight may need very different doses. Old people need less than children and there are many other considerations.

However, that’s only a start. The initial calculated dose of the induction agent, for instance, may turn out to be too much for that patient. Everybody responds a bit differently to any drug. The blood pressure will drop a bit too much but the anaesthesiologist will either let it wear off a bit, (because its short acting) give you a bit of something to restore your BP or simply give less volatile for a bit. If its not enough they’ll give you a bit more. So within minutes of going to sleep your anaesthesiologist will have the measure of you and things will settle down.

Most importantly, you will be continuously monitored and the anaesthesiologist will never leave the room.
