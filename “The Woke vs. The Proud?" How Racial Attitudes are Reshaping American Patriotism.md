### It’s not just age or partisanship that explains who feels proud to be American. The best predictor of national pride today is how people feel about the country's history of racial inequality.

American national pride is in trouble. In the [most recent release from Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/692150/american-pride-slips-new-low.aspx), only 58% of Americans said they were “extremely” or “very proud” to be an American, the lowest number since 2001 and a staggering 33-points lower than 2004 (Figure 1).

**Figure 1 – National Pride, 2001-2025 (Gallup)**

Focusing only on the overall decline in national pride obscures the extent to which weakening attachment to American national identity is a generational and political problem. As Gallup’s data show (Figure 2), young Democrats (particularly those born after 1996) are far less likely to express pride in being American than Republicans, Independents, or even older Democrats. But low levels of patriotism are not just a youth problem. Even Democrats born long before 1996 have become markedly less proud of their country over the past decade. What happened?

Unfortunately, Gallup’s reporting offers few answers. It is not even clear from the figures Gallup publishes whether differences across political identification and age are the largest or most meaningful gaps to focus on. Without a breakdown by race, religion, education, and other political attitudes, it’s impossible to diagnose the causes behind the country’s collapsing national pride.

In this post, I draw on the results of a large (N=4,188) nationally representative survey from 2024 to explore the ideological, cultural, and attitudinal roots of declining American patriotism.[^1] In addition to revealing the substantial impact that religiosity has on feelings of national pride, the analysis presented here provides the first empirical confirmation of what many have long suspected; namely, that *the strongest predictor of national pride today is whether someone is “woke” or “anti-woke” on questions of racial inequality*. Even after controlling for race, education, religiosity, and political engagement, the consistently “anti-woke” are now twice as likely as the consistently “woke” to say they are “extremely” or “very proud” to be an American.

This wasn’t always the case. As I describe below, in surveys from both 1996 and 2014, views on racial inequality were only weakly correlated with feelings about the country. Views on race have recently become intertwined with conceptions of national identity in a way they were not a decade ago.

With this data in mind, it is possible to spell out a more nuanced account of American patriotism’s decline than is typically offered in mainstream outlets. Beginning in 2012, the so-called “Great Awokening” produced a profound shift in the country’s views on race, with young people on the political left endorsing increasingly “woke” answers to long-standing questions of racial inequality. As the analyses I will describe show, if we had the same amount of “wokeness” on racial inequality issues as we did 20 years ago, the percentage of Americans saying they are “extremely” or “very proud” to be an American would be 15-points higher.

But it’s not just that “woke” views on racial inequality have become more popular. It’s also that “wokeness” now plays a much bigger role in shaping how people feel about the country than ever before. A decade ago, many Americans could hold progressive views on racial inequality and still manage to feel proud of their national identity. Not anymore. Today, when Americans think about whether they are proud of the country, they are likely to base that answer on how they feel about the country’s performance on racial inequality. If current levels of “wokeness” were held constant but their relationship to patriotism looked like it did in 2014, we would expect strong national pride (i.e. the percentage of people saying they are “extremely” or “very” proud of their American identity) to be about 14 points higher. In short, both the rise in “woke” attitudes and the way they’ve come to dominate people’s sense of national identity explain why patriotism has unraveled over the last two decades.

Contrary to popular explanations that attribute the left’s growing disaffection with the country entirely to Donald Trump, then, the root causes of eroding national attachment precede the MAGA era and run deeper than simple partisan politics. In fact, Trump may be as much a symptom of the cultural transformation driving the decline of American patriotism as a cause of it.

## Political Identification and National Pride

The most obvious place to start any examination of American patriotism is by looking at political identification. Liberals and conservatives and Democrats and Republicans have long diverged on questions related to national identity, but, as the Gallup data show, the gap has increased sharply in the last decade. Yet, Gallup’s reporting does not tell the full story because it fails to distinguish those holding intense political commitments from those who are less stridently partisan or ideological. In Gallup’s presentation, for example, “strong Democrats” and those calling themselves “independent” but who “lean Democratic” are lumped together to provide a sense of how “Democrats” (defined in the broadest possible terms) feel about “being American.”

The left-hand panel of Figure 3 shows the widely reported relationship between political identification and national pride from a large, nationally representative survey conducted by YouGov in the summer of 2024. Consistent with other data, the results of this survey show a vast “pride gap” between those on the left and those on the right, with conservatives 30-points more likely to express strong pride than those on the left (54.4% to 84.0%).

As the right-hand panel of Figure 3 shows, however, there are large differences in patriotism among liberals depending on the intensity of their liberalism. Specifically, those identifying as “liberal” were vastly more likely to express high levels of national pride than those identifying as “very liberal” (62.1% to 42.2%). In fact, the patriotism gap between “very liberal” and “liberal respondents is almost as large as the patriotism gap between “liberal” respondents and “very conservative” respondents (20-points to 25-points). The extent to which highly progressive Americans stand apart on questions of national pride is hidden by the tendency to lump the American public into three broad camps (left, center and right).

As the Gallup report suggests, however, even this more fine-grained assessment of ideological gaps on patriotism obscures vast generational differences within the political left.

**Figure 4 – National Pride and Ideology and Age (2024 CFSR National Replication Survey)**

Figure 4 shows how age and ideology interact with each other in structuring feelings on national pride. What’s notable about the data in Figure 4 is the extent to which getting older leads to only modest increases in national pride for most Americans (i.e. those who identify as “very conservative,” “conservative,” “moderate,” and “liberal”). Among “very liberal” Americans, however, age is a determinative factor. As Figure 4 illustrates, while roughly 30% of liberals under 30 express high levels of national pride, nearly 60% of “very liberal” seniors do.

The stark patriotism gap displayed in Figure 4 and confirmed in Gallup’s reporting raises as many questions as it answers. For example, none of this data tells us whether there are different levels of national attachment based on key demographic variables such as race, religiosity or education. Most importantly, it cannot begin to help us understand why young progressives are decidedly less prideful of the United States than other Americans.

In an effort to paint a richer picture of the factors shaping American patriotism, Figures 5 through 13 show how strong national pride varies across race, education, religiosity, and political engagement.

## Race and National Pride

The data shown in Figure 5 defy some common assumptions about racial differences in national pride. Contrary to conventional wisdom, there are no large differences in patriotic sentiment among white, Black, and Hispanic Americans. In fact, more than two-thirds of each group say they are “extremely” or “very” proud to be American. Asian Americans, however, are significantly less likely than members of these other groups to express high levels of national pride, with only 52.8% saying they are “extremely” or “very” proud to be American.

## Education and National Pride

There’s been considerable attention paid over the last two election cycles to the “diploma divide” in politics (i.e. the widening gap in political attitudes and voting behavior between Americans with and without a college degree). At the same time, a parallel debate over whether higher education breeds anti-American sentiment among students has emerged, with many critics (mostly on the political right) claiming that colleges and universities now teach young people to hate their own country.

**Figure 6 – National Pride, Age and Education (2024 CFSR National Replication Survey)**

![](https://themissingdatadepot.substack.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d974a6ab-8ea8-47b6-a48f-7cc61a426ac6_648x892.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:892,%22width%22:648,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:155095,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://themissingdatadepot.substack.com/i/168532127?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd974a6ab-8ea8-47b6-a48f-7cc61a426ac6_648x892.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

The data suggest a complicated relationship between national identity and education. As Figure 6 shows, while there is a modestly-sized “diploma divide” in patriotism, it does not follow the pattern that most observers might expect. Among older Americans, college graduates are, in fact, somewhat less likely than non-graduates to express high levels of patriotic attachment. This relationship, however, reverses among “Zoomers,” with young, college-educated adults being more likely to say they are “extremely” or “very” proud to be American than their non-college-educated peers. In other words, rather than eroding patriotic sentiment among young people, higher education now appears to bolster it.

## Religiosity and National Pride

The connection between religiosity and national pride has received scant attention in most mainstream accounts of patriotism. This is unfortunate. In my 2024 survey, across multiple measures, self-reported religiosity was strongly related to national pride.

**Figure 7 – National Pride and Religiosity (2024 CFSR National Replication Survey)**

![](https://themissingdatadepot.substack.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05217bc7-66b4-4c57-8faa-b82d8b17025b_1052x699.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:699,%22width%22:1052,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:189915,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://themissingdatadepot.substack.com/i/168532127?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05217bc7-66b4-4c57-8faa-b82d8b17025b_1052x699.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

As Figure 7 shows, those who attend church and pray more frequently are far more likely than those who never do these things to say they are “extremely” or “very” proud to be an American. Subjective reports of the importance of religion in one’s life show a similar relationship. Collectively, the data in Figure 7 suggest that, for many Americans, religious commitment and national identity are closely intertwined.

## Political Engagement and National Pride

There are good reasons to believe that political engagement will also be associated with feelings of national pride. Individuals who are more politically engaged typically feel a stronger connection to their fellow citizens and to national political institutions. Further, regularly consuming political news reflects a deeper investment in the future of the country, a stronger sense of political efficacy, and a belief that change is possible through civic participation. By contrast, political disengagement is likely to be associated with feelings of alienation, distrust, or apathy (all of which can undermine patriotic sentiment).

**Figure 8 – National Pride and Political Engagement (2024 CFSR National Replication Survey)**

![](https://themissingdatadepot.substack.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/609ee157-6ec1-476b-9811-e248ab8d54d6_781x898.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:898,%22width%22:781,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:166754,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://themissingdatadepot.substack.com/i/168532127?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F609ee157-6ec1-476b-9811-e248ab8d54d6_781x898.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

As Figure 8 shows, those who are politically engaged are, in fact, significantly more patriotic than those who are not. The patriotism gap between the political engaged (i.e. those who follow political news “most of the time”) and the politically disengaged (i.e. those who follow political news “hardly at all”) is nearly 20-points (56.7% to 74.4%).

## Racial Attitudes and National Pride

As discussed above, the role of racial attitudes has loomed larger than perhaps any other factor except political ideology in mainstream debates about patriotism. Racial attitudes, of course, are tricky to measure, however. The primary approach in the social sciences has been to construct an index from responses to the following four statements (where responses can range from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”):

- “Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors.”
- “It's really a matter of some people just not trying hard enough: if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.”
- “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class.”
- “Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve.”

There’s a lively academic debate about how agreement or disagreement with these four statements should be labeled and interpreted. While agreement to the first two statements and disagreement with the last two statements have historically been described as evidence of “racial resentment,” “symbolic racism,” “modern racism” or, in less nuanced accounts, “racism,” recent work has suggested that an entirely different, non-racialized label should be used.

There are several reasons to avoid describing responses to these statements in language that implies overt anti-Black animus. First, the items intentionally conflate conservative ideological beliefs (such as individualism, personal responsibility, and meritocracy) with attitudes about African Americans as a group, making it impossible to interpret responses as straightforward expressions of racial prejudice [^2]. Second, there is a growing body of work showing the items cannot be accurately described as a measure of “anti-Black affect” because they “measure attitudes toward any group, rather than African Americans alone.” Finally, [some research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3701331) has demonstrated that, “contrary to the scale’s typical title, it measures sympathy for blacks as least as much as resentment toward them.”

All of this is to say that there is no consensus in academic circles about how to describe responses to these statements. Some have proposed framing them as measures of “ [just-world orientation](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/carneyenos.pdf) ” given that they reflect beliefs about work ethic and fairness more than feelings about African Americans. Others suggest the collection could be better described as a “ [racial sympathy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3701331) ” for African Americans since it “captures favoring of Blacks substantially more than disfavoring.” Still others recommend referring to them as the “ [Structural vs. Individual Attributions for Black Americans’ Status](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/693907) ” scale. The most generic approach (and least informative) approach is to simply discuss them as measures of “ [views on racial inequality](https://democracyfund.org/idea/pushed-and-pulled/).”

In popular discourse, [these measures have become synonymous with the “Great Awokening,"](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020) the sharp rise in progressive, race-conscious attitudes (especially among white liberals) on issues of identity, inequality, and social justice. As Figure 9 shows, the way liberals answer these questions changed dramatically after 2012.

**Figure 9 – Racial Attitudes Over Time (VOTER Survey)**

Rather than use the uninformative label “racial inequality views,” which does not indicate what high and low scores on the scale mean, I will settle here on the imperfect description of these items as “woke vs. anti-woke” views on racial inequality.[^3]

Regardless of their label, however, it is obvious how such views might impact patriotic attachment. For those viewing the contemporary United States through the lens of historical and ongoing inequality and injustice, expressions of national pride are likely to be seen as an endorsement of a political, economic, and social system that should be drastically reformed or completely dismantled. Patriotism, from this point of view, might be incompatible with a commitment to “social justice.”

Yet, hard evidence about exactly how much “woke” racial attitudes matter for feelings of national pride is in relatively short supply. Unfortunately, there are very few surveys that ask questions about both patriotism and racial attitudes. Major academic surveys (e.g. the General Social Survey, the American National Election Study, the Cooperative Election Study) that routinely tap racial attitudes, for example, have only infrequently included items focused on national attachment. Polling organizations that frequently ask questions about national attachment (e.g. Gallup, Pew Research Center) do not often measure racial attitudes in the same surveys. The lack of datasets that simultaneously track racial attitudes and national pride means arguments linking the two are necessarily speculative.

The only good data we have to empirically identify the relationship between racial attitudes and feelings of national attachment comes from the General Social Survey (GSS). The GSS has asked the first of the “woke vs. anti-woke” views on racial inequality questions (“Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors”) since 1994. In 1996 and 2014, these items were included alongside questions about American national identity.[^4] Specifically, the GSS asked two questions connected to national pride: (1) a question asking respondents: “How proud are you of America’s history?”; (2) a question asking respondents for their level of agreement with the statement: “I would rather be a citizen of America than of any other country in the world.”

Figures 10 and 11 show the predicted impact of agreement with the idea that blacks “work their way up” without “any special favors” and these two measures of national attachment (generated from a regression model controlling for age, ideology, income, race, and education). As the slopes of the lines indicate, in both 1996 and 2014, more agreement with the idea that blacks should “work their way up” without “special favors” was predicted to lead to more national pride. As the slopes also indicate, however, the impact was very small (though statistically significant).

But how do things look since the “Great Awokening”? Fortunately, my 2024 survey included each of the four items required to measure “woke vs. anti-woke” views on racial inequality.

Figure 12 shows the relationship between views on racial inequality and feelings of national pride. As Figure 12 clearly shows, those with the most “woke” views on racial inequality are far less patriotic than those with the most “anti-woke” views on racial inequality. For example, those who “strongly agree” with the idea that blacks should “work their way up….without any special favors” were twice as likely as those who “strongly disagree” to say they are “extremely” or “very proud of being American (39.3% to 89.5%). In other words, those who see America as fundamentally unjust on questions of race are now far less likely to express pride in being part of it than they were in the past.

## A Multivariate Analysis of National Pride

The relationships shown in Figures 3 through 12 make it clear that political identifcation, race, education, religiosity, political engagement, and racial attitudes are all correlated with national pride. They do not tell us, however, which of these factors matters most. The primary problem with looking at simple bivariate relationships like the ones in the figures above is that all of these factors are deeply interrelated. Whites, older people and the highly religious, for example, are vastly more likely than non-whites, young people and the secular to identify as politically conservative. As a result, any apparent relationship between a single variable and patriotism may be misleading. To truly determine the unique influence of each factor individually, we need a multivariate analysis that holds the other factors constant. Only then will we be able to assess whether all (or only just a few) of these characteristics are truly important for shaping feelings of national pride.

With this in mind, I ran a logistic regression model predicting strong national pride (i.e. the respondent saying they are “extremely” or “very” proud to be an American) on the basis of the factors described above; namely, racial attitudes (an index summarizing “woke” vs. “non-woke” views on racial inequality), race, education, religiosity (an index of church attendance, prayer frequency and self-reported religious significance), political news interest, age, ideology and their interaction.

The coefficients for each of these variables are presented in Figure 13.[^5] Negative coefficients indicate that individuals in the labeled category are less likely to say they are “extremely” or “very” proud to be an American while positive coefficients indicate that individuals in the labeled category are more likely to say they are “extremely” or “very” proud to be an American. When the confidence intervals (i.e. the shaded areas around each coefficient estimate) touch the “0” line, they are not statistically significant. When the confidence intervals do not touch the “0” line, they are significant.

With few exceptions, the results in Figure 13 tell the same basic story about the determinants of patriotism that Figures 3 through 12 tell. Even with a full range of controls, religiosity, political engagement, education, age, ideology and the interaction terms exert a significant influence on how Americans feel about their national identity.

The most striking finding to emerge from this set of analyses is the fact that “woke vs. anti-woke” views on racial inequality hav the most consistent, direct, and powerful impact on national pride. To illustrate this point, Figure 14 shows the predicted probability (derived from the fully specified logistic regression model) of being “extremely” or “very” proud to be American based on racial attitudes. Even after controlling for all other factors, “wokeness” has a profound impact on patriotism, with shifts from the most to least “woke” predicted to double an individual’s chances of expressing strong national pride.

The steep slope of the line in Figure 14 is a stark contrast to the slope of the lines in Figures 10 and 11. This suggests that the relationship has likely become much stronger over the last decade. In other words, two things have occurred simultaneously to drive down patriotism: the number of Americans holding “woke” views has increased and these views are increasingly determining how one feels about the country.

## A Post-Patriotism America?

Patriotism means love of country (critically rather than blindly) and is bolstered by a shared consciousness of what it means to be an American. Twenty five years ago, Americans were nearly unanimous in saying they were “extremely” or “very” of their national identity. But that national unity has eroded due to a combination of political and generational changes. Liberals today are much less likely than in the past to express pride in their country. Additionally, Millennials and Zoomers are much less proud of their country than their elders are.

There’s a temptation in an analysis like this to focus exclusively on Trump. It’s true that pride among liberals has risen and fallen along with his time in office over the last eight years. His symbolic role in American politics cannot be ignored and there’s little doubt that his dominance in the discourse has not helped young progressives to feel better about their country.

But it is also crucial to realize that the decline in patriotism began well before Trump took office and it appears to have its origins in longer-standing questions about American society. To be more precise, one of the central causes of disaffection with the country is the growing “wokeness” of young progressives. As shown above, not only has the number of Americans endorsing a “woke” view of racial equality increased but these views are increasingly tied to how these Americans feel about their country.

The main question going forward is whether “very liberal” and “woke” Zoomers and members of Gen Alpha (those born after 2010) can reconcile their progressive values with a sense of pride in their nation. It is possible, of course, that liberal Zoomers’ disaffection with the country is temporary. Perhaps time will foster a greater sense of national attachment in the same way that Boomers seem to have come to terms with the bitterness of the Vietnam era. Commentators suggest that the disaffection of Gen-Z stems from spending their formative years in a period defined by political polarization, economic uncertainty, COVID, and Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. If these experiences fade from memory, Gen Z may age out of their alienation.

Nevertheless, globalization and multiculturalism continue to gnaw away at the prioritization of a common national identity and the value of citizenship. The zeitgeist dominating the elites in academia, the media, and multinational corporations denigrates rather than celebrates American history and current social progress. What’s more, loyalties in place at age 30 rarely change much.

It’s easy to be dismissive about the decline of patriotism. For some, the trends in Figures 1 and 2 will feel like progress, a kind of validation that fewer Americans are embracing what they see as a version of national pride that excuses inequality and enables injustice. But patriotism – when properly conceived as critical love of one’s country and a commitment to ideals rather than myths – has long served as a vital form of “civic glue.” It links people across lines of race, class, religion and ideology by offering a shared sense of purpose, obligation, and destiny. It motivates civic participation, national service, and self-sacrifice. Perhaps most importantly, it fosters the kind of institutional trust and commitment to democratic norms that pluralistic societies need to endure.

Ultimately, this is why the current decline in patriotism is significant. Not because pride in America needs to remain high for its own sake, but because a country with millions of citizens who view it as shameful and morally illegitimate is a country that will be increasingly difficult to hold together. Americans can, should and will debate how to remedy inequality. But if we lose the sense of a shared national “we,” the talk may not be of “One America” but of “No America.”

[^2]: The usual approach for addressing this intentional conflation is to conduct multivariate analyses that control for political ideology with the hope that statistical control will completely purge the conservative component of the items. If the ideological component could, in fact, be removed the residual impact of the scale’s items might be attributed solely to anti-black animus. As [recent research has shown](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1065912915586631), however, this is a misguided hope. Even in the rare instances where a sufficiently broad range of ideological controls are used, the index still contains a significant ideological component.

[^3]: While the specific features of being “woke” vary across accounts, as political scientist Wilfred Reilly has argued, they all include “belief that (a) the facially neutral institutions of society are structured to oppress, (b) all group performance gaps provide evidence of this opperssion, and (c) the solution is equity- proportional representation across group lines.” The items of the scale described above are closely connected to these ideas.

[^4]: The GSS asked the national identity and racial attitudes questions in 2024 but the released data, for some reason, does not include the “special favors” question. The codebook for the 2024 release shows the question was asked but that the responses are “not available in this release.”

[^5]: In the figure, the coefficients displayed under the headings “Ideology,” “Gender,” “Education,” “Race” and the interactions show the effect of moving from the “excluded” category of each listed variable to the category identified in the left-hand column of the plot. For example, the coefficients for each ideological group (e.g. “Liberal,” “Moderate,” “Conservative,” “Very Conservative”) indicate the effect of politically identifying as one of these categories relative to identifying as “Very Liberal.” Similarly, the coefficient for “female” shows the effect of identifying as a woman relative to identifying as a man. The coefficients under the heading “Race” show the effect of each racial group relative to “Whites.” The coefficients for the remaining variables (family income, the index of racial attitudes, the index of religiosity, news consumption) represent the predicted change in strong patriotic attachment from moving from the lowest possible score to the highest. For instance, the coefficient for the index of racial attitudes shows the predicted impact of being the most “woke” to the most “anti-woke.”
