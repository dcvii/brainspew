\[Sujatha Srinivasan, Host\]: This is “Where We Live” from Connecticut Public Radio. I’m Sujatha Srinivasan in for Catherine Shen.

Last year, the National Institutes of Health cut more than $3 billion of funding for medical research across the country. Congress is now working to undo those cuts before a January 30th deadline. But for many, the damage is done. Grants were cut, frozen or delayed.

In Connecticut, UConn lost $41 million from grant terminations and non-renewals. And as of January, federal actions have resulted in more than $26 million of research funding lost at Yale. Today, we hear how these cuts are impacting the future of medical research.

Joining us now is Rob Stein. He’s a correspondent and senior editor on NPR’s Science Desk. Rob, thanks for being with us today.

\[Rob Stein, NPR Science Reporter\]: Well, thanks for having me.

\[Host\] Also with us is Professor Evan Morris with the Yale School of Medicine. His research was impacted by the federal cuts and delays. Professor Morris, it’s a pleasure to have you on Where We Live.

\[Evan Morris, Yale Professor\] Thanks for having me.

\[Host\] Rob, we are talking about federal funding cuts for medical research. What are you hearing from researchers around the country?

\[Reporter\]: Well, I guess I would characterize the past year as incredibly tumultuous, and in many ways traumatic for many researchers around the country. I mean, they’ve gone through something unprecedented when it comes to federal funding for scientific research.

As you mentioned, billions of \[dollars in\] grants were terminated, cut, then restored, then terminated again, and it’s just been a chaotic year for scientific research, making it very difficult for a lot of projects to continue and making the future very uncertain. So, I think people are really kind of traumatized by this past year.

\[Host\]: And as you mentioned, Rob, first there was a funding cut and then \[grants were\] frozen and then \[there were\] delays in grants and then changes \[in awards were\] introduced. We’re going to get to that in a bit. But there’s been a lot of flip flopping with the cuts and Congress stepping in to potentially undo them.

What are the politics behind all this? Where do President Trump and Health Secretary Robert Kennedy want to take the NIH?

\[Reporter\]: They have made it pretty clear that they think the system is broken in many ways and that they need to fix it. They feel like a lot of the priorities of the scientific establishment have been misplaced and they feel like they need to step in and have a reset. Reset the kinds of research that are funded, the priorities for scientific research, everything about it, how grants are judged and approved or not.

There’s been an overlay of judging research based on whether \[the proposal\] has any involvement in DEI. It has become a sort of litmus test for \[funding\] that is still ongoing. Researchers, and even a lot of grant *makers*, are constantly having to read the tea leaves and try to navigate a new terrain to avoid a forbidden list of words in \[writing\] scientific grants.

\[Host\] And talking about reading the tea leaves, Professor Morris, how have you been reading the tea leaves these last several months?

\[Professor\] Frankly, I’d be happy if I *had* some tea leaves to read.

There’s just been such great uncertainty that it makes it impossible for people to plan. You mentioned delays in funding, which have affected me and we can talk about, but there has even been confusion in the messages being sent from NIH, which is my primary funder. I can’t make decisions.

\[Host\] (NIH Director) Jay Bhattacharya recently was talking about how hard it has been to get scientists on board. I was listening to that with some interest. Thinking about all the unexpected and sudden shifts, e.g., to the clampdown on indirect costs, to shift to multi-year grants. Could you explain that in a sort of fireside chat to people who are not familiar with how this works on the inside? What are these changes?

\[Professor\] Sure. If I can.

You mentioned some of the critical ones. Indirect rates, you’ve probably talked about before. Indirect costs are the monies that don’t come to me in a grant, but go to the institution. People like to say, “to keep the lights on”, but that’s too much of a simplification.

They go to all sorts of infrastructure that we need but that cannot be charged to my particular grant, which is configured to study and answer a *very narrow* question. So that’s an uncertainty at the university level, which filters down to the researchers.

Let’s see, what else did you mention?

\[Host\] The multi-year grants. Even should Congress overturn the cuts, which would require the full House, Senate, and President to sign, it sounds as if *multi-year grants*, are here to stay.

What are multi-year grants? How are they going to affect researchers? Why are researchers so concerned?

\[Professor\] Right.

Normally, let’s say I apply for a five-year grant and it is awarded. I’m only given a *year* of the money I requested at a time. That enables lots of others whose budgets need to be funded that year to get the money they need.

If, on the other hand, NIH goes to a lot of multi-year funding, it means giving me all five years of the money I’ve asked for at one time. But just simple arithmetic says that four other people won’t get funded this year at all.

Multi-year funding is not entirely unprecedented. I’ve had two-year grants before, and to save on bureaucracy, the government has given me the money for both years at the same time. But those were small and it wasn’t a wide-spread practice. This sounds like a significant change, which would, as most of us fear, mean that far fewer people, certainly in the beginning, have any money at all to work with.

\[Host\] Tell me about your life’s work.

You’ve dedicated, as I understand, just at Yale alone, more than 17 years. But what is it that you do that makes you get out of bed in the morning and excited to say, “this is the difference that my work makes in this world?” What do you do?

\[Professor\] Well, that’s a tall order. I’m not sure that I can claim to make that much of a difference, except on the local level.

But I’ll tell you what I do and what I really enjoy doing. What I do first. I’m a biomedical engineer by training, and I’m a professor of biomedical imaging, which means two things for me. One, my students and postdocs and other people who work for me develop new algorithms, new methods, new mathematical models to understand medical images, most of which, for me, are images of the brain.

And second, we also apply those algorithms to ask basic biological and medical questions. So that’s my gig.

What I really *enjoy* the most, which is related to this topic, is interacting with my students and postdocs. That’s very rewarding.

\[Host\] And you’ve studied the effect of stress on people with substance use disorder and drug craving. That’s a critical area of study given what’s been unfolding across our country for years now.

\[Professor\] Yes. My claim to fame, as it were, is that my colleagues and I have put people in the PET scanner and asked them to smoke cigarettes.

And during that smoking period, we have acquired brain images and analyzed those brain images to identify the *particular response of the brain* to the substance that a person is addicted to.

One of our interesting findings, for which we’re about to publish a replication study, is that the response in the brain of *men* to smoking their cigarette is different from the response of *women* to smoking *their* cigarette. Now, that could simply be taken as a sort of scientific oddity, but it does beg the question: “Well, if the brains of women and the brains of men respond *differently* to what they’re addicted to, maybe they’re actually different *diseases,* and *maybe* they need different *treatments*?”

So even though what I do is *basic* research, it has implications downstream for medical practice and treatments.

\[Host\] So where does your work stand now? Is it stalled? What about your people that work with you, researchers? Are they still on your payroll? How deeply have you been impacted?

\[Professor\] Yes, thanks for asking that. I have absolutely been impacted to the extent that I had to lay off one talented research scientist.

I still have at least three, four active funded projects. So, the layoff was not the result, in my case, of a grant being *canceled*, per se. It was merely the result of the funding being *delayed* for four months.

Unfortunately, during that period that the money was held up, I was in a position of having to sign a letter saying, “yes”, I have money for Sarah’s salary for next year. And I was *unable* to sign that letter. So, Sarah had to \[leave and\] make deals with other investigators.

That was a loss to *me*. And, it was a loss to the *public* because we have, as yet, not been able to publish the results that the public *paid* us to acquire and to report. *And* it’s a loss to the *scientific community* because nobody can yet build on what we’ve done.

\[Host\] I’m sorry to hear that. How much of your research funding actually does come from the federal government? Do you rely for the most part on the federal government?

\[Professor\] Yes, 100 percent of my funding at the moment \[comes from NIH\]. It’s not always been the case, but the great majority has always been from NIH.

And another important thing, if I could, that people have to understand is that a lot of people like me who work as professors and researchers at big research institutions are on what is called *soft money*. That means that we depend on those grants for the entirety of our salary, the salaries of all the people that work for us, and to fund the research itself.

So, when there’s no money coming in, there’s no money to *spend*. And even though large research institutions like our favorite one in New Haven have big endowments, that’s *not money* that I can access.

I don’t have a rainy day fund.

\[Host\] Rob, how would you respond to what we just heard from Professor Morris? He’s with Yale, one of the country’s largest institutions with a huge endowment. What about the smaller institutions across America? What are you hearing from them?

\[Reporter\] Yeah, I’m hearing a lot of despair, honestly, about the current state of affairs and about the future of the scientific enterprise in this country. I think it might be helpful to step back for a minute and remind everyone about how our scientific \[research\] system works.

It started after World War II when, essentially, the federal government made a grand bargain with academic institutions around the country that this is the way the United States would establish itself as the leader in scientific research around the world. The federal government would fund research institutions around the country, universities, and their research labs. And that built a great edifice that did\[, in fact,\] make the United States *the* *scientific powerhouse* of the world. And it fueled not just scientific discoveries, but it became a big economic engine. It led to vaccines, was the basis for the Internet, you name it.

But it was all predicated on trust that the federal government would be there to support the system into the future. Because the way science works, it takes a lot of time. You have to be able to plan for the future.

The big concern right now is that the trust in the system has been shattered.

And the question is, can it be rebuilt? People are not sure.

\[Host\] Rob, has anything like this ever happened \[before\] in the history of the NIH?

\[Reporter\] I don’t think so. It has been very unprecedented this past year.

I’ve been covering science for decades and I’ve never seen anything like it. The tumult, the chaos, the confusion, and the uncertainty are certainly unprecedented.

\[Host\] Congress appropriators are looking to overturn this. Can you walk us through the NIH budget for the coming year.

It looks like there’s been a direct rebuke to the Trump administration’s decision to clamp down on medical research. So, there has been some pushback. But how strong is it and how far can it go?

\[Reporter\] Yeah, it’s interesting.

The Trump administration had proposed a massive cut to HHS and to the NIH budget. But so far in Congress, as you mentioned, there’s been pushback. At the moment, not only is Congress not signing on to a giant cut in the NIH budget, it is proposing a slight *increase* in the NIH budget. \[Understand,\] the NIH budget has been increasing steadily for years now.

It’ll be interesting to see if that survives or not. You also mentioned the indirect costs issue.

That was an earthquake when the administration first proposed it. It came late on a Friday, suddenly out of the blue. And it was a shock. The indirect costs, as Professor Morris mentioned, keep the lights on.

And *that is a simplification*. But without the federal government supporting those indirect costs, research cannot continue. They pay for everything from keeping the lights on, to taking the trash out, to administrative costs.

\[Host\] That \[cut\] was stopped in the courts. And so far in Congress, there doesn’t seem to be any support for it. For the moment, the indirect cost system seems to have survived. And we’re going to have to see if that continues.

It’s back to looking at the tea leaves and we’re talking about uncertainty and we’re talking about years of work and advancement being put on hold.

But I’m concerned, as you are, Professor Morris, about the future of young academics looking to break into the profession. On the one hand, you have the immigration clampdown, the $100,000 H-1B visa fees that would affect universities like Yale. And then on the other hand, you have these NIH funding cuts. How concerned are you about their future?

\[Professor\] I’m very concerned about the system, and I’m glad that Rob reviewed where it came from.

To use a sports analogy, you can’t get a championship major league team without a good farm system, without an adequate pipeline of new players coming in. And my new star players come from *all over the world*.

And if those players who are potential stars, many of whom come and stay to be long-term contributors to the United States science community and economy, are deterred and/or recognize that there’s so much chaos in the United States that they should go elsewhere for their advanced training, they will and they’ll stay there. They’ll stay in China. They’ll stay in Singapore. They’ll stay in Australia.

And it’ll be a great loss to us.

So, two things are going to happen, I fear.

One is that the veteran players like me will retire earlier than we had planned. And, two, without those veteran players, there’ll be a shortage of mentors, and so the young players coming up will go elsewhere for training.

\[Host\] It’s not wholly unexpected, but put that way, it’s a pretty bleak picture for the future of medical research in our country.

Where do you see a silver lining? Does all of it rest in the hands of our politicians now?

\[Professor\] OK, let’s see if there is a silver lining. I am completely on board with the idea that the public, through its elected government, gets to periodically evaluate and re-evaluate priorities. That’s how a democracy should work.

To the extent that we scientists now recognize that, and have been put on notice that the public, through its elected politicians, is re-evaluating its priorities, it puts the onus on us to make the best case we can for what we do. Maybe we got a little lazy, thinking that there’d always be support for us. That’s not fair, and it’s not true to the public that funds us.

I have an obligation to explain myself because I have the privilege of working with federally funded grants. So, there’s the silver lining, perhaps.

\[Host\] It comes down to a functioning democracy, and at the heart of it is communication.

We have brilliant scientists across the country, but scientists are famously known to be very scientific in their conversations and perhaps above the heads of people who are not directly associated with the field and don’t quite know the answer to, “Wait a minute, what’s at stake here? Why should I care?”

So, in the meantime, how do you plan to continue your research, Professor Morris? How do you go to your lab and keep doing what you do?

\[Professor\] That’s a very good question, and I have to say that it’s become much more difficult.

I still have grants that are funded and will continue to work on them, and my colleagues and I are looking for alternative sources of funding. Although again, a lot of what I do is *basic* *research*. So, there isn’t necessarily a commercial market for it or an *obvious funder* other than the federal government.

I’d like to re-emphasize what Rob said, that this arrangement has worked wonderfully over the years. And notwithstanding the re-evaluating of priorities, we have gotten a lot for our massive investment, and there *is no investor of the same magnitude as NIH for biomedical research*.

I admit that was a little bit of a dodge of your question.

\[Host\] No, the essence is very clear. The heart of your message is very clear. From Connecticut Public Radio, this is “Where We Live”. I’m Sujata Srinivasan.

Evan Morris, professor at the Yale School of Medicine, thank you for being with us.
