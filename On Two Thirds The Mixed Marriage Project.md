I am honored to continue the “Abolishing Racism: Creating a Future Without Race” series with an extraordinary conversation featuring Dr. Dorothy Roberts.

📚 The Mixed Marriage Project: Lessons on Race, Love, and a Future without Racism

📅 February 3, 2026

⏰ 1:30–3:00 PM ET

💻 Virtual

Drawing on archival research and her forthcoming memoir, Professor Roberts challenges the enduring myth that interracial love alone can dismantle racism. Instead, she invites us to consider how intimacy becomes politically transformative only when it confronts—rather than denies—the structures of racism that shape our lives and relationships.

This is the second annual event in the series I launched last year with Dr. Hoda Mahmoudi, Professor and The Baha’i Chair for World Peace at the University of Maryland, College Park, and it continues our collective work of imagining—and creating—a future without race/ism.

🎟️ Free and open to the public

Join us for a rigorous, honest, and deeply human conversation about love, power, and what abolition really demands of us.
