This is a simple explainer on the types of crude oil, where it comes from around the world, and what the US lacks.

Save it

It is not about oil, please. There are different reasons and while some like oil and drugs align, they are all secondary to simply kicking China and Russia out of that hemisphere.

The oil story is a bit more nuanced than this.

Americans built the oil rigs in Venezuelan. We owned them. We took it back.

The graph is wrong!

US doesn’t produce 20 million b/d of crude oil. The maximum crude oil production I believe never exceeded 14 million b/d.

This “oil expert’s” 20 million figure includes natural gas liquids.
