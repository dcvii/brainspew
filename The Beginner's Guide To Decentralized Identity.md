Identity is one of the most important factors in the digital experience of every individual. The identity of an individual offers a sense of self to the individual with the help of unique traits. On the other hand, the identity of an organization could focus on the types of products or services they offer. Similarly, bodies of authority could have a distinct identity based on their roles. As digital transformation takes the limelight, decentralized identity has emerged as a formidable necessity. Why? Take the examples of fake credentials, certificate frauds, and data breaches leading to the exposure of sensitive personal and financial information. Investigation of the causes underlying such problems would lead to setbacks in existing centralized [digital identity](https://101blockchains.com/digital-identity-in-web3/) systems. 

The answers to “What is decentralized identity?” can open up new perspectives on the importance of decentralizing digital identities. Decentralized identities rely on three significant pillars, such as [blockchain technology](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-technology-explained/), decentralized identifiers, and verifiable credentials. The following post offers a detailed explanation of the [decentralization](https://101blockchains.com/decentralization-in-blockchain/) of identity, along with examples and use cases.

DIDs help in the pseudonymous identification of users through the representation of user identities as decentralized domain names and alphanumeric letters. Conventional identifiers such as an email address or social media account depend on third-party service providers. 

On the contrary, users can issue, hold and control decentralized identifiers. The storage of DIDs on blockchains ensures that they are unique, cryptographically verifiable, and have higher availability. Decentralized identifiers can be related to different entities, such as individuals, government institutions, and business organizations.

- #### **Verifiable Credentials**

Verified Credentials, or VCs, are another prominent example of [decentralization](https://101blockchains.com/decentralization-in-blockchain/) of identity. Reviews of answers to “What is decentralized identity?” can showcase the ways in which VCs can decentralize identity. Verifiable credentials are the decentralized versions of certifications, licenses, and other legal documents, which you can store in decentralized wallets. The working of verifiable credentials revolves around three distinct entities such as the holders, issuers, and verifiers. 

The holders of verifiable credentials refer to the owners of the credentials. 

Issuers in VCs are the organizations that approve the credential for the holder. The university would serve as an example of the issuer for the decentralization of degree certificates as verifiable credentials.

Verifiers are also a crucial highlight of decentralized identity projects for creating VCs. The verifier could be anyone ranging from an employer to a platform. Employers could verify the academic credentials of an individual, while a platform could verify the identity of the individual for accessing specific services.
