Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers fatally shot a woman during an operation in Minneapolis Wednesday.

As videos of the incident went viral, the Department of Homeland Security justified the shooting on self-defense grounds, calling the slain woman a “violent rioter” who “weaponized her vehicle” by driving towards federal agents.

“Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

“The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. The ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries. This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) disputed the DHS account of the shooting during a press conference and demanded ICE leave the city, accusing them of terrorizing innocent people.

“ ICE is already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly that it is bullsh\*\*,” Frey said. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying.”

“To ICE, get the f\*\*\* out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety and you are doing exactly the opposite,” he added.

Frey vowed to pursue justice without offering specifics. It is unlikely the ICE agents face federal charges given the Trump administration’s steadfast support for the agency. Governor Tim Walz (D) said Minneapolis will oversee a thorough investigation into the incident.

“I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine. The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,” Walz said.

Viral video footage appeared to show the woman’s parked SUV partially obstructing an ICE truck as it drove around on a one-way street. An agent could be seen approaching the truck and briefly interacting with the woman before she drove off. Soon after she drove off, shots were fired and nearby protesters were yelling as her car got close to striking an ICE agent. The victim does not appear to have been armed or the target of ICE activity.

She was [later identified](https://nypost.com/2026/01/07/us-news/woman-fatally-shot-by-ice-agent-identified/?utm_source=sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=news_alert&utm_content=20260107?&utm_source=sailthru&lctg=65d0ec2c4cc70685b0030ae8&utm_term=NYP%20-%20News%20Alerts) by her mother as Renee Nicole Good, a Twin Cities resident who was pronounced dead at the hospital after being shot in the head. Good’s mother was surprised her daughter would have been involved in a protest against ICE.

President Trump addressed the situation Wednesday afternoon, offering full-throated support for the ICE agent who shot Good as her car came towards him.

“The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital. The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.”

Like Trump, McLaughlin said the incident is part of a larger pattern of violence towards ICE agents. Liberal opposition to the Trump administration’s plans to mass deport illegal immigrants has led to a significant rise in assaults and death threats towards ICE agents. There have been numerous [violent](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/illinois-congressional-candidate-and-five-others-indicted-for-violent-ice-protest/), disruptive protests against ICE agents in liberal enclaves such as Los Angeles and Seattle.

Several left-wing activists [are facing](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/left-wing-militants-charged-with-attempted-murder-after-ambushing-officers-near-ice-facility/) attempted murder charges for ambushing an Alvarado, Texas ICE facility in July by luring agents outside and firing at them from the woods nearby. The Trump administration later slapped [terrorism charges](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/two-suspects-indicted-on-first-antifa-related-terrorism-charges-in-texas-ice-attack/) onto two of the militants involved with the ambush.

A separate shooting occurred at a Dallas, Texas ICE facility in September when a gunman fired at an unmarked vehicle, killing two detainees and wounding another person inside. The used [ICE tracking apps](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/dallas-shooter-searched-for-apps-that-track-ice-activity-hoped-attack-would-cause-real-terror-among-agents/) to plan the attack and committed suicide following the attack. Authorities found shell casings with anti-ICE messages next to his body.

Democratic lawmakers routinely criticize ICE agents as a rogue, paramilitary force inflicting cruelty on law-abiding people. The Trump administration regularly emphasizes its focus on deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records or ongoing proceedings. Republicans massively increased ICE’s budget as part of its tax and budget megabill passed over the summer. The spending increase is meant to bolster ICE’s deportation capabilities to get closer to the Trump administration’s ambitious targets.
