MINNEAPOLIS — [Renee Nicole Good](https://nypost.com/2026/01/08/us-news/who-is-renee-nicole-good-minneapolis-woman-killed-by-ice-agent/), the mom who was killed by a federal agent after veering her car toward him, was an anti-ICE “warrior” and was part of a group of activists who worked to “document and resist” the federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota, The Post can reveal.

Good, who moved to the city last year, linked up with the anti-ICE activists through her 6-year-old son’s woke charter school, which boasts that it puts “social justice first” and “involving kids in political and social activism,” multiple local sources said.

“She was a warrior. She died doing what was right,” a mother named Leesa, whose child attends the same school, told The Post at a growing vigil where Good was killed Wednesday.

Good and her wife Rebecca, 40, who were raising the child together and sent the boy to Southside Family Charter School, a K-5 academy opened in 1972 which has from its inception been “unabashedly dedicated to social justice education,” [according to co-founder Susie Oppenheim.](https://southsidepride.com/2025/03/04/southside-family-charter-school-embraces-change/)

It was through her involvement in the school community that Good became involved in “ICE Watch” — a loose coalition of activists dedicated to disrupting ICE raids in the sanctuary city.

“From my understanding, she was involved in social justice … we are a tight-knit community and a lot of parents are \[activists\],” former Southside gym teacher Rashad Rich, who resigned from the school last month, told The Post.

He said current event topics like the killing of George Floyd were regular parts of the curriculum, and that last month students took a field trip where they learned about “aboriginal issues” — a reference to the indigneous people of far-away Australia.

Similar coalitions have cropped up all over the country — with activists using phone apps, whistles and car horns to warn neighborhoods when ICE shows up. ICE Watch activists can also turn confrontational — with numerous instances of activists ramming agents with their cars in the past.

“\[Renee Good\] was trained against these ICE agents — what to do, what not to do, it’s a very thorough training,” Leesa said.

“To listen to commands, to know your rights, to whistle when you see an ICE agent,” she added.

“I know she was doing the right thing. I watched the video plenty of times but I also know in my heart the woman she was, she was doing everything right.”

ICE agents have faced an unprecedented spike in car attacks, surging by some 3,200% over the last year, shocking data released by the Department of Homeland Security revealed to The Post.

Federal officials said violent “radical rhetoric from sanctuary politicians” is to blame for vehicular attacks targeting ICE agents skyrocketing between Jan. 21, 2025, and Jan. 7, 2026, which jumped to 66 attacks compared to just two the year before.

In October, US Border Patrol agents shot an armed woman in Chicago who attempted to run over agents with her car after a group of activists “boxed in” agents with 10 cars.

Last month, a federal judge dropped the charges against the woman, Marimar Martinez, who survived the shooting.

Good, a 37 mother of three, was shot in the head and killed as she [sped her SUV in the direction of two immigration officers](https://nypost.com/2026/01/07/us-news/video-shows-ice-agent-shoot-woman-in-minneapolis-who-tried-to-hit-officer-with-car-dhs-says/) who were conducting an enforcement operation just south of the city’s central business district.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the shooting, which remains under investigation, was an act of self-defense and that the Goods had been “stalking and harassing” ICE agents in Minneapolis throughout the day.

County worker Kristin Peter, 30, who was also at the vigil, said Renee was on the same ICE Watch team as one of her coworkers, and that she herself was attending a meeting of the group Thursday night.

“They were on the same team, they would eat meals together,” she said as she waved a lit bundle of sage at the memorial site.

Rebecca follows ICE Watch on Instagram, which on Thursday shared a post by radical activist group Twin Cities Ungovernables that encouraged people to bring items for barricading the E. 34th Street and Portland Avenue intersection where the shooting took place.

They even urged people to bring “things to burn,” including their dried-out Christmas trees.

School friend Leesa said a lot of families associated with the school live in the area where Good was killed, a largely working-class neighborhood with tree-lined streets and a large number of homes with windows decked out in LGBTQ+ flags.

According to the Southside Family Charter School’s website, it provides “an academically challenging, socially conscious education to diverse learners,” and declares it’s “proud” to offer what it calls a “social justice curriculum.”

A photo from its Facebook page shows a dry-erase board of students’ “hopes and dreams” for the future, which include “Donald Trump’s heart grows 3x as big.”

The Goods had no love lost for President Trump themselves, leaving their Kansas City, Missouri neighborhood to Canada after the 2024 election with plans to leave the country for good.

They lived in the Great White North for a few months before settling in Minneapolis, [a former neighbor toldKMBC](https://www.kmbc.com/article/woman-killed-minneapolis-ice-shooting-kansas-city-ties/69940624).
