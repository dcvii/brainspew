**Vladimir Propp - Narrative**

  

  

Born in 1895, Vladimir Propp was a Soviet folklorist. He read Russian folk tales and from this he broke them down and analysed these tales in detail picking apart how they were written. From this Vladimir created his 7 character types theory and it is still used in films today (for example. Shrek). Although most films don’t follow Vladimir’s Theory directly, most films with a good storyline and plot will have some elements included. Vladimir’s theory consists of..

The hero – Character who reacts to the dispatcher and donor characters, thwarts the villain, resolves any lacking or wronghoods and weds the princess.

The villain – Evil character that creates struggles for the hero.

The princess – Deserved by the hero, but cannot be claimed due to some evil or injustice.

The dispatcher – Character who illustrates the need for the hero’s quest and sends the hero off.

The helper – A typically magical entity that comes to help the hero in their quest.

The donor – Character that prepares the hero or gives the hero some magical object, sometimes after testing them.

The false hero – Figure who takes credit for the hero’s actions or tries to marry the princess.
