Q: I read that Ronald Reagan said the following: Senator Fulbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the president as “our moral teacher and our leader,” and he says he is “hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document.” He must “be freed,” so that he “can do for us” what he knows “is best.” What did Fulbright actually say in context?

A: The quote attributed to Ronald Reagan originates from his October 27, 1964, speech titled "A Time for Choosing," delivered in support of Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign. In it, Reagan paraphrased and condensed remarks made by Senator J. William Fulbright (D-AR) to criticize what he portrayed as liberal overreach in expanding government power at the expense of constitutional limits.Fulbright's original statements appeared in a 1961 address, often referenced as delivered at Stanford University (though the full text was also published that year in the Cornell Law Quarterly under the title "American Foreign Policy in the 20th Century under an 18th-Century Constitution"). The speech focused on the challenges of conducting U.S. foreign policy in a rapidly changing global landscape dominated by communism, nationalism, and technological advancements. Fulbright argued that the Constitution's checks and balances—designed for a simpler, isolated, agrarian society in the 18th century—unduly restricted the President's ability to lead effectively in international affairs. He contended that Congress, influenced by parochial local interests and short election cycles, often obstructed coherent foreign policy, while the President, with a national perspective, was better positioned to educate the public and build consensus.Here are the key exact excerpts from Fulbright's address that Reagan drew upon, with surrounding context for clarity:
- On the President's unique role as a leader and educator:  
	"The source of an effective foreign policy under our system is Presidential power. This proposition, valid in our own time, is certain to become more, rather than less, compelling in the decades ahead. \[...\] The President is the symbol of the nation to the external world, the leader of a vast alliance of free nations, and the prime mover in shaping a national consensus on foreign policy. \[...\] He alone, among elected officials can rise above parochialism and private pressures. He alone, in his role as teacher and moral leader, can hope to overcome the excesses and inadequacies of a public opinion that is all too often ignorant of the needs, the dangers, and the opportunities in our foreign relations." Context: Fulbright emphasized that the President, unlike members of Congress (who are beholden to local constituencies), has a broader view and must act as an educator to guide public opinion on complex foreign issues. This was not a call for the President to act as an unchecked "moral teacher" dictating domestic policy but rather to lead in building national unity for international challenges.
- On constitutional restrictions "hobbling" the President:  
	"It is my contention that for the existing requirements of American foreign policy we have hobbled the President by too niggardly a grant of power. \[...\] The overriding problem of inadequate Presidential authority in foreign affairs, however, derives not from the internal relationships within the executive branch, but from the 'checks and balances' of Congressional authority in foreign relations. While Congress has many powers under the Constitution, having to do with foreign affairs, these powers do not enable the Congress to initiate or shape foreign policy, but to implement, modify, or thwart the proposals of the President. \[...\] The President is hobbled in his task of leading the American people to consensus and concerted action by the restrictions of power imposed on him by a constitutional system designed for an 18th century agrarian society far removed from the centers of world power." Context: Fulbright criticized the Constitution's design—rooted in 18th-century fears of concentrated power and assumptions of minimal U.S. involvement in global affairs—as outdated for the 20th century's demands, such as rapid responses to crises like the Cold War. He noted that tools like Senate "advice and consent" on treaties and congressional control over appropriations often delayed or diluted executive initiatives. However, he was not advocating for abolishing these checks entirely; instead, he highlighted how they made foreign policy inefficient compared to more centralized systems in other nations.
- On the need for potential changes to the system:  
	"In a world beset by unparalleled forces of revolution and upheaval, we Americans are confronted with the painful and urgent duty of re-examining the functional adequacy of some of our most hallowed and hitherto unquestioned institutions. The question we face is whether our basic constitutional machinery, admirably suited to the needs of a remote agrarian republic in the 18th century, is adequate for the formulation and conduct of the foreign policy of a 20th-century nation, pre-eminent in political and military power and burdened with all the enormous responsibilities that accompany such power. \[...\] The dynamic forces of the 20th century—communism, fascism, aggressive nationalism, and the explosive awakening of long quiescent peoples—are growing more and more unmanageable under the procedures of leisurely deliberation which are built into our constitutional system. \[...\] It is imperative that we break out of the intellectual confines of cherished and traditional beliefs and open our minds to the possibility that Basic Changes in Our System may be essential to meet the requirements of the 20th century." Context: Fulbright called for openness to reforms, such as extending congressional terms to reduce election-year pressures, consolidating congressional committees for better oversight, or relieving the President of ceremonial duties to focus on policy. He explicitly warned against unchecked power, noting the Founding Fathers' concerns about corruption and stressing that any changes must balance authority with accountability. He did not suggest "freeing" the President to unilaterally "do for us what he knows is best," as Reagan implied—this phrasing appears to be Reagan's interpretive addition to portray Fulbright's views as favoring authoritarian executive overreach.
In summary, Fulbright's remarks were narrowly focused on enhancing presidential leeway in foreign policy to adapt to modern global realities, not on broadly dismantling constitutional limits or elevating the President as a domestic moral arbiter. Reagan's 1964 paraphrase altered phrasing (e.g., "teacher and moral leader" became "our moral teacher and our leader," and the 18th-century system became an "antiquated document") and added dramatic flair to fit his critique of big-government liberalism. Ironically, by the mid-1960s, Fulbright shifted toward criticizing executive overreach, chairing Senate hearings that exposed excesses in the Vietnam War under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
