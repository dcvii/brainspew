The passage of the **Affordable Care Act (ACA)**—commonly known as **Obamacare**—in 2010 involved extensive **political maneuvering, deal-making, and arm-twisting** within **both the Senate and the House of Representatives**. Here are the key tactics and pressure strategies that helped push the legislation through:

---

**1. Navigating the Senate Filibuster (60-Vote Requirement)**

• Democrats initially held **60 Senate seats**, enough to overcome a Republican **filibuster**.

• **Senator Ben Nelson (D-NE)** was a key holdout. He secured the controversial **“Cornhusker Kickback”**, a deal ensuring **federal Medicaid funding for Nebraska** in exchange for his support.

• **Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA)** also negotiated extra Medicaid funding for Louisiana, known as the **“Louisiana Purchase.”**

• Both deals were **politically explosive** and later repealed due to backlash.

---

**2. Overcoming Moderate Democratic Resistance**

• **Conservative Democrats (Blue Dogs)**, particularly in the House, were concerned about the bill’s impact on spending and abortion coverage.

• **Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI)** and other anti-abortion Democrats threatened to oppose the bill unless **federal funds were barred from covering abortion**. President **Obama signed an executive order** to reassure them.

**3. Reconciliation Tactic to Bypass the Filibuster**

• After **Sen. Ted Kennedy’s (D-MA) death** in 2009, Democrats lost their 60th Senate vote when Republican **Scott Brown** won his seat.

• With no filibuster-proof majority, Democrats **couldn’t pass the Senate’s amended version of the bill in the House** and then send it back to the Senate.

• Instead, they used **budget reconciliation**, a legislative process that only requires **a simple majority (51 votes) in the Senate**. This maneuver **sidestepped the Republican filibuster**.

---

**4. Pressure on House Progressives**

• The **House Progressive Caucus** initially demanded a “public option” (a government-run insurance plan), but the White House and Senate rejected it.

• **Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)**, Speaker of the House, personally pressured progressives to accept the **weaker compromise version** of the bill.

---

**5. Presidential & Party Leadership Pressure**

• President **Obama held private meetings** with key legislators, including conservative Democrats and progressives, to **push for unity**.

• **Vice President Joe Biden**, known for his ability to work the Senate, played a crucial role in persuading reluctant senators.

• **Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s Chief of Staff**, was aggressive in enforcing party discipline, using **threats, promises, and favors** to get votes.

---

**Final Vote Breakdown**

• **Senate:** Passed **60-39** on December 24, 2009.

• **House:** Passed **219-212** on March 21, 2010 (without a single Republican vote).

**Conclusion**

  

The passage of Obamacare was one of the most complex **legislative battles in modern U.S. history**, requiring backroom deals, **policy concessions, and political strong-arming**. Democrats **used every tool at their disposal**, including the **nuclear option**, the **budget reconciliation process**, and intense **pressure tactics** to ensure its passage.
