According to [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704/trivia), the number displayed by Euclid actually contains 218 digits:

> 941432434315126593210548723904868285129134748760 2767195923460**23**858295830472501652325259296925727655364363462727 184012012643147546329450127847264841075622347896267285928582953 47502772262646456217613984829519475412398501

The number that Max Cohen writes on paper does have 216 digits (and is completely different); see the link for the digits.

A careful analysis on [another site](http://mike.passwall.com/uselesstrivia/pi.html) says that one of the 216 digits is illegible, but is given as a '9' by IMDb. It also points out that two digits of the 218-digit number (in bold above) are reversed when they appear on the paper found with Sol Robeson.

> The number 216 is very significant when one multiplies 6x6x6 and receives the result of 216.
> 
> The connection to 666 is amplified by its presence in the Darren Aronofsky's film _Pi_ where the protagonist stumbles upon a hidden code in the universe, a 216 digit number, which a group of zealous Jews believe to be the true name of god.
> 
> In the printout of the 216 digit number, the number 6 can be seen in the beginning of the second, third and fourth rows, forming a vertical 666.
> 
> The idea of a 216-letter name of god is actually taken from real Jewish history and belief. The 216-letter name of god (the Schemhamphoras) is derived from three verses in Exodus (verses 19, 20, & 21), each being 72 letters long (72x3=216). Each was written out as a string of letters: verse 19 on top, then 20 underneath and in reverse order, and then 21 under that. Reading top to bottom and right to left, the 3 lines of 72 letters yielded 72 individual 3 letter names.[1](http://synchromystic.wikia.com/wiki/216)
> 
> The number 72 connects to 216 again in the time frames involved with the precession for the equinox. Each of the 12 Ages lasts for 2,160 years, and the earth takes 72 years to move one degree in the Great Year. The connection to 12 continues beyond there being 12 Ages, in that the entire cycle lasts about 25,920 years which is 216x120.

# Pi

Useless Hacker Movie Passwords and Trivia

Webspace Sponsored by:

This page (like others in the [Useless Trivia space](https://mike.passwall.com/uselesstrivia/)) exist to provide analysis and review of computer security in films. Reviews of usernames and passwords used in these films will be mentioned as they can be found and identified.

**Pi**: Modern, Conspiracy, Coincidence

No Passwords/Passcodes/passphrases/secret keys. 3 _different_ "Secret numbers"... (1 number is dramatically different from the other two, while the other 2 are only different with 2 numbers being transposed.)

There is "the number" our main character (Max) is trying to find again to help
predict the stock market and just about anything. 

(Hacking Ring-Zero or Ring-Negative-One; if prediction of events is possible,
with 100% accuracy, then entropy does not exist. Without entropy, where would
random numbers be? Where would much of crypto go?)

In the film, a group of people shown as "Jewish Mystics" with interest in
numerology and their religion is also looking for what he believes is the
same number.

The number he finds twice is as follows with break as seen on the screen:

**>PX/**

  **AACE**
  **6 1/2**
  **-8 1/4**

The movie is consistent, in this string of digits is the same (ignoring the 
two character transposition) for each scene it is shown except _one other 
scene_. Also...

Each line above is 50 digits long except for the last line which has only 18
digits. Total length of number above: 218

The number of digits the "Jewish Mystics" were looking for: 216 digits
The number later references by the professor (Sol) as the one found while
searching for Pi: 216 digits

The length of the displayed number compared to the one mentioned as being
desired if off by 2! (The film seems to try to be accurate on all other points.
I find the difference between the two numbers amusing. :-) 

A different number is found later in the film:
(This is supposed to be the number he writes from the screen by hand. However,
the paper is not the same as the paper where the first number was being
transcribed by him. Also, though we see him transcribe the beginning of the
218 digit number (above) this next number (216 digits) is not the same one
we saw him start to transcribe!)

## _Only God is Perfect_

* NOTE: We see "86% Accuracy" "Only God is Perfect" as part of a newspaper
advertisement from "Lancet Percy" when Max gets a newspaper to see the stock
that plummetted to $6.5/share. (This is the company that offers him the new
chip through Marcy Dawson.)

Each line has 27 numbers. This number _is_ 216 digits long, but is not
the same number that Max found listed first - a 218 digit number.

Later, he goes back to visit the professor (Sol) with which he plays games of
Go. He had challenged his professor (Sol) to find again the 216 digit number.
He finds the professor again suffered from a brain injury and was dead
(suggested as a result of finding "the number".) A paper, assumed to be
written by the professor (Sol), had a recorded number which read:
(Shown with same line breaks)

Lines 1-6 have 22 digits each. (132 digits)
Line 7 has 25 digits in it     ( 25 digits)
Line 8 has 23 digits in it     ( 23 digits)
line 9 has 27 digits in it     ( 27 digits)

Total:                         (218 digits)

(I had originally made a mistakie here! I compared the two sets of numbers:
* Those from the original Print Out
* Those from the professor (Sol)
I originally found them to be the same, but this was not true!)

Also, this is _almost_ the same as the number we see on his computer screen
First printed on screen (partial) and in hardcopy (full) with stock

Second printed on screen (full) with him starting to copy it by hand (partial)

you see below are the same as those on the professor's note.)

In an expanded analysis of one of the strings of number listed above, I received an e-mail message from **"Chargen >> " from the Netherlands**: _Some (unsolved?) movie trivia.. Pi_

_Something's has me puzzled after watching the movie Pi._

_The following is taken from the handwritten newspaper hardcopy of the 216-digit number in the movie:_

884509627386359275033751967
943067599621731590401694134
434007629683591574337516791
197615733475195375920401694
343151239621353184932676605
800621596380716399501371459
954387507655892533875618750
354029981152863950711207613

_Of course this number differs from the 218 digit number we see elsewhere on the film._

_Other than the primes mentioned by Max in the scene that follows, a first glance makes the number appear meaningless._

_However, taking a closer look, you find interesting properties..._

_For example a reversed mirrored sequence:_

[040[1694] 134
4340076 2968 [3591 5743 3751 6791 |
1976 1573 3475 1953] 7592040 [040[1694]

_The sequence after '|' is mirrored. Backward masking comes to mind. Yet another closer look reveals [962], [750] or [33751] which I consider outside markers (there are possibly more to be found)... in between there are several primes._

[962].. 173,159 [040[1694] ...... [962]

_I think there's indeed a textual message or perhaps a spiral formula contained in this number as movie hints "the syntax is in between the sentences". It might just as well be a joke (Darren Aronofsky's social security number for instance) who can tell..._

_L-move or " C;173 L? Dk\ " ??_

Thanks to **"Chargen >> " from the Netherlands** for the above information and work to find it. (e-mail address not included in this web page).

Thanks goes to ["Sutur" <hermes4293@hotmail.com>](mailto:hermes4293@hotmail.com)) for pointing out the numbers from the printout and the note left by the professor (Sol) are _not_ the same, and where they are different.

So, why is 23 reversed to 32 as a difference between the two?

How is it important to the film?

Notes: Pi was made for viewing in 1997. "23 - Nichts ist so wie es Scheint" was released in 1998. Coincidence?

Also consider the 218 digit number; if we remove the two digits that are different between the professor's (Sol's) paper and the original printout, then we do have a 216 digit long number.
