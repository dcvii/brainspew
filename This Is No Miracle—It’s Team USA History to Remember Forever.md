## Outgunned by their Canadian rivals, an inspired U.S. Olympic men’s hockey team roars to a historic sudden death victory in Milan

These were Olympians born long, long after Lake Placid—many were babies and toddlers when the Kurt Russell movie came out. To them, the Miracle on Ice was a story, not a memory, something extolled by the elders, about the collegiate amateurs, the mighty Soviets, Mike Eruzione, Al Michaels, and a game for the ages that was shown on tape delay.

Now they’ve got a story of their own.

On Sunday, the [U.S. men’s hockey team defeated Canada 2-1](https://www.wsj.com/sports/olympics/usa-canada-hockey-olympic-gold-87dd4f08?&mod=article_inline) in sudden-death overtime to capture the country’s first gold medal since that glorious run in upstate New York. Forty-six years to the day since their underdog predecessors toppled the Mighty Red Machine, United States men’s hockey is golden again.

Unreal. And yet, very real.

There are major differences, yes. This victory is no miracle. The final in Milan was contested by NHL professionals, millionaires all. Team USA wasn’t a ragtag group, but the nation’s very best, the product of generations of elite domestic development and the game’s widening geography. Hockey is played everywhere in the U.S. now, and the homegrown talent is better than ever.

Yet on the other side, that was still a heavyweight, a Goliath in red. Canada is Canada, the keeper and class of the sport, and they were favored to win this final, as they had in 2010 and 2014, the last time these games were contested by NHL glitterati. They outshot the U.S. 42-28, controlled the puck all afternoon, sent out lines of would-be legends to follow actual legends. At times if you squinted, it really looked like the varsity versus the JV.

In the end, it didn’t matter, because it’s hockey, and sometimes, what it takes is a little more belief. The U.S. may have been outgunned, but they played opportunistic, inspired hockey, guided by a hunger for gold and the loss of a teammate, Johnny Gaudreau, struck and killed by a motorist a year and a half ago.

It was the game the U.S. and Canada both craved. They’d given everyone a taste of their border feud last year with the NHL’s Four Nations tournament, where they’d brawled and battled before Canada finally settled it on the ice. At Milan Cortina, both teams survived overtime to reach the final, delivering the storybook outcome, NBC’s dream, served over breakfast in North America: 60 minutes to sort it all out.

Or maybe a little longer?

Of course this game had to go into overtime. Was there any doubt that this absurdly riveting bad blood showdown could do anything but take it to the brink, like it had in Vancouver 2010, or even Boston a year ago?

They wouldn’t need much. Just 1:41 into extra time, Jack Hughes—Jack Hughes, born in Orlando, Fla.—snapped a shot past Canada goalie Jordan Binnington. Suddenly, it was over, and the U.S. men joined their golden forebears from Lake Placid and Squaw Valley 1960.

Canada, they’ll talk about the near misses and coulda shoulda’s. They had chances upon chances: most notably, a 5-on-3 power play advantage it failed to convert. Stars like Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon and teenage wonder Macklin Celebrini repeatedly barraged the zone, to no avail.

They’ll be haunted by chances and near misses. Most of all, they’ll be haunted by Team USA’s goalie.

Yes: This is where we talk about Connor Hellebuyck. When the story of this team is told, perhaps 46 years from now, I’m sure folks will recall Hughes’s wonder goal in overtime, but it is the 32-year-old Hellebuyck who won this game, not just once, but repeatedly, over the course of hours, batting away Canadian shots and rushes and sending frustration rippling across the provinces.

“He was our best player tonight by a mile,” Hughes said.

Hughes had blood in his mouth, and a fresh gap in his teeth wide enough to scoot a Vespa through, courtesy of a high stick to the mouth from Canada’s Sam Bennett.

As his teammates celebrated on the ice—they’d soon bring out Johnny Gaudreau’s children to pose for a photo with their late father’s jersey—Hughes talked about how proud he was of his country, of his team, of the way they played on a day they’ll never forget.

American hockey, Jack Hughes called it. Not a miracle, but it tasted just as sweet.
