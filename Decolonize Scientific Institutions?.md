***Nature** recently published an op-ed headlined “ [Decolonize scientific institutions, don’t just diversify them](https://archive.ph/sL85Q) ”The op-ed aims to boost “Indigenous Peoples” through (i) redistribution of property rights and (ii) dilution of scientific research. The first theme falls well outside **Nature** ’s expertise and the second demeans it. While [the op-ed was quickly rebutted by Jerry Coyne](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2025/08/15/the-journal-nature-calls-for-decolonization-of-modern-science/), I will re-examine it here with more wonderment*. *Apart from signaling its own virtue, did **Nature** publish this op-ed more to support the campaign or to tacitly warn against it?*

The op-ed sets out “eight steps to stop marginalization in academia and to enable a shared Indigenous agenda in science”. The eighth step is labeled “Move towards Land Back”. The discussion there justly distinguishes between the pious “land acknowledgements’ of “educational universities built on stolen Indigenous lands” and actual transfers of property rights and large payments for them. The authors want more talk transformed into money.

For three other steps—“Fund Indigenous Scientists”, “Create safe spaces in science”, and “Foster Indigenous sovereignty”—the key feature is long-term funding earmarked to people described as indigenous. This too is a kind of property right but its ownership is hard to ascertain. Everyone is indigenous somewhere, but hardly anyone lives where distant ancestors did, and where some bloodlines gain preferential treatment, mixed-blood descendants clamor for inclusion. What fraction of indigeneity is enough for full or partial recognition? Which indigenous councils should judge? If self-identified, how to prevent abuse?

The pre-transfer status quo has defenders too. Some deny fundamental injustice, believe they repaid in other ways, or fear that re-adjudicating the past will cause more trouble than it’s worth. Eventually democratic polities grind toward compromises that leave a plurality happy and most of the rest tolerably unhappy—until a new wave of outrage washes through.

I do not fault the activist authors for talking their book on property rights and trying to shift public opinion. However, **Nature** is not an appropriate forum for this debate. Property rights turn on economic efficiency, legal interpretation, political power, and public acceptance. Let specialists in these areas weigh in through their own publications and redirect interested scientists there.

## Illogical Arguments

What is fit for discussion in **Nature** is the authors’ perspective on scientific research. Let’s start by correcting some assertions that are false, irrelevant, or misleading:

- *“Dominant science (sometimes referred to as Western science) is rooted in colonization, racism and white supremacy. “*

The truth is mostly the opposite. Colonization and white superiority were rooted in technological superiority, which in turn drew on science. Racism goes both ways.

- *Science “has been an active participant in the assimilation, marginalization and genocide of Indigenous people.”*

Like speech, writing, song, and prayer, science has been used for both bad and good. Over the past century, science has saved and extended more indigenous lives and provided indigenous people better food, clothing, shelter, and useful information than previous generations imagine possible.

- *“Many \[scientific\] institutions were funded by money acquired after stealing Indigenous lands.”*

Those institutions were also primed with ideas and technologies brought by late-comers. We can’t parse every human creation for restitution. Potatoes, spread from the New World by Spanish conquerors, are now a vital part of Māori cuisine. Should Māoris shun potatoes for the association or pay tribute to Peruvians every time they partake?

- *“The accomplishments of scientists, past and present, are often celebrated \[…\] without acknowledgment of the harm they perpetuated.”*

Most celebrations of accomplishments gloss over related failures; free speech for critics is the best antidote. But scientific accomplishments deserve special accolades as the know-how lives on and fertilizes other innovations long after the initial accomplishers are gone. There’s a joy in figuring stuff out that others rightly honor and share, despite occasional misuse. It is rare to find a key to heaven that can never open a gate to hell.

- *“Colonialism remains deeply embedded in many facets of dominant science, leading to inequitable health and social outcomes.”*

Science is dominated by the search for natural laws that transcend political authority and can be applied by many. The world’s fastest growing centers of innovation are in Asia, which both drew on Western science and rebelled against colonial domination.

- *“For example, Indigenous people globally have lower life expectancies and higher rates of maternal and infant mortalities than other population groups.”*

That comparison is irrelevant to the accusation. Indigenous mortality rates were far higher until they were exposed to “dominant science” and have fallen at record rates since.

- *“Facial-recognition algorithms are often based on white facial features, meaning their results have high false-positive rates for Black and Indigenous people.”*

Those algorithms are based on the facial data accessed, which was initially mostly white and is gradually expanding. In the big picture, indigenous people today are lucky beneficiaries of epoch-making discoveries by others, and which are largely offered free of charge.

- *“Indigenous scientists are chronically underfunded internationally.”*

That is mainly because there aren’t many highly trained indigenous scientists, which in turn reflects small numbers of indigenous applicants scoring well on STEM exams.

- *“For example, in the United States, between 1996 and 2019, white principal investigators were consistently funded by the National Science Foundation at higher rates than were principal investigators of colour.”*

That comparison doesn’t adjust for training either. However, it is mostly irrelevant to the previous claim, since none of the main “investigators of colour” come from groups indigenous to the US.

- *“The key metric of research success used by most funding mechanisms is narrow: the number of papers published in high-impact journals. But these papers are often \[…\] prohibitively expensive for scholars who do not have institutional revenues.”*

This is a relatively minor constraint compared to low test scores and other interests.

- *“Indigenous science scholarship often gets relegated to review-type or opinion pieces rather than primary research papers.”*

True, indigenous researchers don’t write many primary research papers that pass peer review. “Relegated” suggests racial discrimination, but if this were common then there wouldn’t be much publication of indigenous reviews and opinions either.

- *“Many Indigenous scholars also conduct, and want to publish, research in the language of the community involved, which can be at odds with the dominance of English in high-impact journals.”*

Journals dedicated to high impact naturally publish in the language most used by scientists, which currently is English. There is no indication that indigenous people are singularly disadvantaged by that, especially given how many grew up in English-speaking countries.

- *“Indigenous Peoples have accumulated and developed place-based knowledge about our local environments, through systems built on each community’s philosophies, methodologies, criteria and world view.”*

The first half is true and is increasingly prized by scientists of all persuasions. The second half weaves in interpretations that might not withstand critical analysis by others.

- *“It is crucial that scientists do not extract Indigenous Knowledge systems from local contexts.”*

For use know-how broadly, it is crucial to extract it from local contexts. Potato cultivation in New Zealand might make changes from Andean norms.

- *“… but instead engage with the Indigenous communities who steward such knowledge, with their full consent.”*

This asserts intellectual property rights for indigenous know-how. If other peoples assert similar rights, this will slow knowledge transfer worldwide, with “Indigenous communities” suffering most. Why? Because they comprise relatively small minorities with shorter written records and with less experience living in dense, industrialized societies.

- *“Universities must stop treating Indigenous Knowledge as supplementary to ‘real knowledge’; this perpetuates white supremacy in science.”*

Science is founded on doubt that transcends any human phenotype or “our elders said so” tradition. White supremacy is already fading in science as Asia advances, without challenging long-standing, painfully defended norms of rational debate and empirical testing.

- “ *Indigenous sovereignty \[includes\] the right of Indigenous Peoples to control how our own data, artefacts and tissues are collected, accessed and used.”*

Property rights judged worthy of compensation should be decided in a relatively standardized way. Otherwise, every research endeavor involving indigenous data risks bogging down in legal disputes. The very fear of this deters research, which in turn throttles the learning from indigenous experience that the authors claim to prize.

## Research Priorities

Now let’s consider the research priorities advocated or abjured in the op-ed.

- *“Indigenous faculty members add other strengths to research communities: outreach, education and mentoring… But those activities require time away from writing papers and grant proposals, and are typically not valued and rewarded by funding mechanisms.”*

Translation: Divert research funding toward indigenous teaching and advocacy.

- *“Conventional metrics of research excellence must be expanded. Reports written for Indigenous communities should be considered equivalent to peer-reviewed manuscripts.”*

Translation: For faculty labeled indigenous, treat popularization on par with novel research and self-declaration on par with peer review.

- *“The scientific community must acknowledge the value of research that is led by Indigenous communities, as well as research that centres Indigenous Knowledge systems.”*

Translation: Delegate some scientific research to outside indigenous groups, with warnings not to disrespect their output or let objective scientific tests undermine consensus beliefs.

- *“Although hiring in \[indigenous-heavy\] cohorts is not sufficient by itself to change organizational culture or shift power, it is crucial to help build a critical mass of Indigenous scientists who will enable enduring change.”*

Translation: Counter historical underrepresentation with overrepresentation in current hiring, regardless of objective merit.

- *“Evaluation and promotion processes should be redesigned \[to\] take into account the lived experiences of Indigenous academics as well as the community members they work with.”*

Translation: Since “lived experience” is inherently subjective, indigenous self-ratings and approval of indigenous non-faculty should factor more into faculty rewards.

- Scientists *“can redress historical injustices \[by\] exposing students to Indigenous research methodologies and enabling citation justice, which recognizes and elevates the contributions of Indigenous scholars, knowledges and communities.”*

Translation: Counter skepticism about “indigenous science methodologies” through uncritical exposure and pressure to cite them more. (If taken seriously, *Nature* should regularly publish old creation myths from peoples around the world and accord them equal status with cosmology and evolutionary biology.)

- *“Indigenous scientists need safe spiritual, physical and emotional spaces where we can be our full selves. The University of Minnesota Duluth, for instance, has co-developed several degree programmes … alongside facilitating community-based training on political topics such as tribal sovereignty and tribal–state relations.”*

Translation: Give indigenous scientists more time off and encouragement to conduct political training.

In short, the authors recommend that indigenous scientists be held to much laxer standards than others. If taken literally, this guarantees an administrative mess. Should Indian scientists be held to higher standards if they live in the US than if they live in India? Should peer review depend on which country their paper was produced in? Do scientists of mixed ancestry qualify as indigenous in multiple countries or none?

The authors evidently focus most on native peoples in former English settler colonies. To broaden support, they would likely encourage copycat demands for Blacks and Hispanics in the US, while excluding Asians as overrepresented. The ostensible justification is that all ethnic groups would have similar group performance in all fields were it not for others’ oppression. This is easily refuted by the glaring contrasts between groups’ representations in [math](https://substack.com/home/post/p-170571734) and [sports](https://substack.com/home/post/p-167749177).

Operationally, the core demands boil down to ethnic quotas. That is a bad idea in principle, since academics should focus on the idea coming out of brains and not the skins they’re covered with. That is an even worse idea in practice, since it foments resentment and disrespect. It makes academics’ skin color a useful estimator of their prowess, when we should aim to make it useless. It will make it harder, not easier, for top-notch scientists from underrepresented minorities to get the respect they deserve.
