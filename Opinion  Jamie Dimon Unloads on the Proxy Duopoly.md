[JPMorgan](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon unloaded on the proxy advisory duopoly of Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services this week, and it’s hard to think of two companies more deserving of the lashing. Let ’em have it, Jamie.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio expresses "cautious optimism” for a deal, but Vladimir Putin is making military gains in the Kursk region, raising the question of what the U.S. will do if Russia wants to keep fighting. Plus, Chuck Schumer faces the ire of fellow Democrats after arguing that helping to pass the House GOP spending bill is better than shutting down the government.[Read Transcript](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/opinion-potomac-watch/is-trump-ready-if-putin-refuses-a-ukraine-cease-fire/C526E1CE-A8BB-4535-9C4C-628997555AE7)

Glass Lewis and ISS provide recommendations to asset managers on how to vote their shares on proxy ballots. Pension funds, college endowments, foundations and mutual fund providers outsource their voting to the two firms, which make up 90% of the proxy advisory market. But the firms have conflicts of interest and don’t do adequate due diligence.

“They are incompetent,” Mr. Dimon said at a [BlackRock](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BLK) retirement summit. “They are owned by the NGOs,” meaning non-governmental organizations. Their data is “wrong,” he continued, yet “they don’t have to correct them.” And companies “can hire them” to improve their corporate governance ratings. “Really? They should be gone and dead, done with,” Mr. Dimon said. He’s right on every point.

Glass Lewis is owned by a Canadian private-equity firm while ISS is majority-owned by Germany’s [Deutsche Borse](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/DB1). They are heavily influenced by leftist activist investors and government pension funds. They threaten to vote against directors if companies don’t abide by environmental, social and governance mandates.

At the same time, they sell consulting services to companies on how to win their support for proxy votes. The implicit pitch: Buy their services, and they can help your company pass muster with . . . ISS and Glass Lewis.

ISS last month announced that it would no longer include diversity in its voting recommendations for U.S. boards, saying “we anticipate that institutional investors and U.S. companies will have a range of perspectives on DEI.” Yes, but ISS heretofore required companies to follow its “cookie cutter”—to use Mr. Dimon’s term—DEI rules.

ISS walked them back because of the Trump Administration’s DEI scrutiny, and the outcry among pension funds is revealing. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees the city’s worker pension funds, stressed that ISS “helped build the evidence” for diverse boards. How dare it now abandon the woke cause it championed.

Other pension fund managers complained that they weren’t consulted prior to ISS’s DEI reversal and that the concentration in the proxy advisory market left them few alternatives. Perhaps hoping to gain market share, Glass Lewis then announced it would maintain its diversity rules to “deliver the vote recommendations expected by clients.” All of this makes Mr. Dimon’s point.

Pension funds are better off doing their own due diligence on companies instead of subcontracting their judgment to politically compromised proxy advisers. Meanwhile, the Trump Securities and Exchange Commission can make the ISS and Glass Lewis duopoly abide by the same disclosure rules as public companies. See how they like it.
