[Are black people still oppressed in America?](https://www.quora.com/Are-black-people-still-oppressed-in-America)

Only the oppressable kind. Most black people I know are unoppressable. That’s because they’re strivers and survivors. You recognize them almost immediately. They’re just successful in life and they don’t have to take themselves so damned seriously. Of course there are black Americans who are fragile and sensitive and sometimes even dainty. I know. I have some of them in my family, and some of the people I used to hang around are like that too. They often take cues from the media and will find something bad that happened to some successful black person - as if black people are supposed to be magically immune from tragedy. Tragic things happen. I get it. For example. I knew a man back in the 80s who was a senior manager at Xerox. He had been an All-America lacrosse star at Ohio State. He ran strategy for one of the business divisions, but one year before I met him he got in a huge car wreck. His speech was a slurred and half his face was messed up as if he had a stroke. But you could tell that he was sharp as a tack, yet you could also tell that some basic things were difficult. Sometimes he would freeze in the middle of a sentence. Nevertheless he was very calm and self-possessed. You could tell he was in control of his life, but he simply couldn’t speak quickly. Twenty years later I found him - he became a success in real-estate. Nowhere near as intellectually taxing as strategy for a high tech firm and definitely slower paced. But he was not the kind of person you could put down. A car wreck that would have ruined another person just deflected him. The overwhelming majority of Americans never get to meet All American kinds of successful people in their regular lives. And really once you have and you get to see what it’s like to be around them and get their confidence - there’s really no reason you should make certain excuses for yourself. But I understand if you’ve never met that kind of black American, you might not believe they exist in significant numbers. But it’s just like seeing a yellow Porsche and somebody tells you it’s a 911 GT3 RS. Suddenly you start to recognize other Porsches like it, and then you know. Soon you find out where the people who have them hang out. Then somebody asks you is it true that the Porsche 924 was a shitty Volkswagen? Yes you have to admit its true. It’s also true that they were going to stop making rear-engine 911s because of the 924. Or that when they started making water-cooled cars everybody hated them. What I’m saying is that it’s stupid to focus your attention on the mediocre and the dysfunctional. Once you know world-travelled, brilliant Americans, you just hang around them and people like them. Yes, people will always be poor, stupid, backwards and oppressed. If the poor and oppressed knew how to work the system, they wouldn’t be poor or oppressed. You can’t tell me that black Americans haven’t figured out how to work the system. Do you recognize this man? If you don’t, that’s your homework, not mine.

If your family lived there, would you move them? Would you wait for Democrats or Republicans to move them?[Marlon Micou](https://www.quora.com/profile/Marlon-Micou)

Why put the burden on the families to move instead of holding the companies accountable? How the hell do you sell your home in that area if you wanted to move?[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

Somebody works in all those factories. For them, it’s a good deal. The calculation is simple, you either get sick and go with a class action and wait for the settlement, if you win, or you don’t get sick, move out. Money or health. It’s the same thing for everybody everywhere; make economic decisions. Do you wait out the hurricane and take your chances, or do you sell your house in New Orleans and move before the hurricane hits.

The basic responsibility for the well-being of your family lies with the family itself. That’s called self-determination. Or you can spend your time and effort trying to politicize your plight and wait for somebody’s pity to save your ass. Maybe you can get some students to occupy an administration building with picket signs and chants about Cancer Alley. Good luck with that.[Marlon Micou](https://www.quora.com/profile/Marlon-Micou)

That was dumb as hell, why would employees that know of the dangers, want to live there and suffer the same fate? And you clearly know nothing about lawsuits, even if your side wins, the defendants will drag out paying for years through appeals. A class action lawsuit does you no good if you are dead or dying!![Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

She should be the hero of anyone with a conscience!! You should have watched that BEFORE you posted.

In this life, the thing you have the most control over is the attitude that you bring to it.

He’s a YouTuber that reviews many different types of tech by the name of Marques Keith Brownlee, but goes by MKBHD for short: [Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com%2F@www.youtube.com/@mkbhd "www.youtube.com")

Blacks have a glorious history of overcoming. No false ideology can hold down black potential.
