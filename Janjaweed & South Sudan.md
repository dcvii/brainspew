The Janjaweed militias, active primarily in Sudan, have been central figures in a conflict marked by severe human rights abuses, destruction, and displacement. Over the past two decades, their activities have left a significant impact:


**Key Activities and Outcomes:**


1. **Mass Atrocities in Darfur (2003–2005):**

• The Janjaweed were heavily involved in the Darfur conflict, particularly between 2003 and 2005, where they carried out attacks on villages, massacres, and systematic campaigns of sexual violence.

• These actions contributed to what the United Nations described as “one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century,” with allegations of genocide.

2. **Displacement and Refugee Crises:**

• Their operations led to the displacement of over 2.5 million people and the deaths of an estimated 300,000 civilians in Darfur.

• Refugee camps in Chad and other neighboring regions swelled as people fled their homes.

3. **Regional Destabilization:**

• The violence spilled over into neighboring countries, including Chad and the Central African Republic, destabilizing the region.

• Reports emerged of Janjaweed forces participating in cross-border raids.

4. **Integration into Official Forces:**

• The Sudanese government, accused of arming and supporting the Janjaweed, rebranded them in later years. Many fighters were absorbed into state-sanctioned paramilitary groups like the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

• The RSF became a formalized yet controversial force, accused of continuing atrocities and acting as a power tool for Sudan’s military leadership.

5. **Continued Human Rights Abuses:**

• Over time, Janjaweed-linked forces continued to commit crimes, including during Sudan’s 2019 political upheaval, when RSF members were implicated in a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests.

6. **Weakened International Standing for Sudan:**

• The Janjaweed’s actions contributed to Sudan’s global pariah status, international sanctions, and the indictment of former president Omar al-Bashir by the International Criminal Court for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

7. **Recent Activities (2020s):**

• The RSF, rooted in the Janjaweed militias, remains active and a powerful entity in Sudan. In the ongoing power struggles, such as the 2023 conflict between Sudanese military factions, RSF has played a central role, further perpetuating violence and instability.

  

**Legacy:**


The Janjaweed’s legacy is marked by:

• Profound suffering and destruction in Darfur and beyond.
• The transformation into institutionalized forces like the RSF, sustaining their influence and capacity for violence.
• A weakened and fragmented Sudan, struggling with internal conflict and governance challenges.

Their actions have left scars on the people and landscape of Sudan and the surrounding region, with justice and reconciliation still elusive for many affected communities.

**Creation of South Sudan**


South Sudan became an independent country on **July 9, 2011**, following a decades-long struggle for autonomy and self-determination by the southern Sudanese population. The partition of Sudan was the culmination of civil wars, peace agreements, and a historic referendum.
 

**Key Steps Leading to South Sudan’s Independence:**


1. **Background of Conflict:**

• Sudan experienced two brutal civil wars (1955–1972 and 1983–2005) between the north, dominated by Arab and Muslim elites, and the south, home to predominantly Christian and animist populations with diverse ethnic groups.

• Root causes included economic disparities, religious and cultural discrimination, and disputes over natural resources, particularly oil, most of which is in the south.

2. **The Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005):**

• The war caused over 2 million deaths and displaced millions more. It was fought between the Sudanese government and the **Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A)**, representing southern interests.

• This war brought international attention to the region’s plight, with growing calls for peace and recognition of southern grievances.

3. **Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) of 2005:**

• Mediated by regional and international powers, including the United States, Kenya, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the CPA ended the war.

• Key provisions included:

• **Autonomy for Southern Sudan:** Southern Sudan would have a six-year period of self-governance (2005–2011).

• **Referendum on Independence:** The south would vote on independence after the interim period.

• The CPA also shared oil revenue between the north and the south, as much of Sudan’s oil is in the south but relies on northern pipelines and ports for export.

4. **The 2011 Referendum:**

• The referendum, held from January 9 to 15, 2011, was a pivotal moment.

• **Results:** An overwhelming **98.83%** of southern Sudanese voters chose independence.

• The process was monitored by international observers, including the United Nations and African Union, and was largely deemed free and fair.

5. **Declaration of Independence (July 9, 2011):**

• On this date, South Sudan officially became the world’s 193rd independent state and the 54th in Africa.

• The independence marked the end of a unified Sudan but not the region’s challenges.

  

**Who Approved the Partition?**

1. **Sudanese Government:**

• The Sudanese government, led by then-President **Omar al-Bashir**, officially agreed to the referendum and its results as part of the CPA.
• Despite his approval, Bashir faced international and domestic criticism, as the loss of South Sudan meant losing much of Sudan’s oil wealth.

2. **International Community:**

• The partition was widely supported by key international actors:

• **United Nations (UN):** The UN provided logistical and technical support for the referendum and later recognized South Sudan as an independent state.

• **African Union (AU):** The AU supported the CPA and independence process, framing it as a resolution to a long-standing conflict.

• **United States and Other Western Nations:** The U.S., under the George W. Bush administration, was a key advocate for the CPA and independence referendum. President Barack Obama’s administration continued support for South Sudan’s independence.

3. **Regional and Global Support:**

• Countries like Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia played crucial roles in mediating peace and supporting independence.
• China, a major importer of Sudanese oil, also recognized South Sudan’s independence, ensuring stability for its oil interests.


**Aftermath and Challenges:**

While independence was a victory for South Sudanese self-determination, the new country faced immediate challenges, including:

• Internal political strife leading to a civil war in 2013.
• Economic struggles due to over-reliance on oil.
• Ongoing tensions with Sudan over borders, oil revenue, and unresolved disputes in regions like Abyei.


Despite these challenges, South Sudan’s independence remains a landmark achievement in Africa’s history of self-determination.
