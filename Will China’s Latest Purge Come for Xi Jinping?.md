On Saturday, China’s top general, Zhang Youxia—long perceived to be one of Xi Jinping’s greatest and most trusted allies—experienced a stunning fall from grace. The 75–year-old vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) was [removed from his post](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/china-xi-zhang-youxia-military.html) and accused of corruption. Even worse, Chinese authorities say they suspect him of betraying Xi himself.

In another stunning revelation soon after his removal, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Zhang is being accused of [leaking secret information](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-top-general-accused-of-giving-nuclear-secrets-to-u-s-b8f59dae?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqe6eweZQi00FQDVP5m9rY1HVhNjmX6WBYY5bCjO-13FCkq_Wv1D1mloHn_C8qo%3D&gaa_ts=6977ec5a&gaa_sig=zhkzeP1xHXkL9E_qB-YTzZQPqOJbiANv7sWwIlxBKL-zADPrdFgXpKQRvF_rdpmZe7F-5XuGNOM9NIzJ9VXWTg%3D%3D) about China’s nuclear program to the United States.

Zhang is perhaps the most prominent, and most surprising, figure to fall victim to Xi’s ruthless anti-corruption campaign, long viewed by sinologists as the Chinese leaders’ thinly veiled approach to purging his political rivals.

But the purge is so secretive that even the most experienced China watchers are unsure of what, exactly, is going on. What we do know is that something momentous is playing out as China flexes its extraordinary military and economic might ahead of a possible invasion of Taiwan—an event that could lead to a direct confrontation with the U.S.

Purges are far from a rarity in the history of Chinese politics. When Xi Jinping first rose to power in 2012, he did so on an anti-corruption campaign which saw an [estimated 170 officials](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-41670162), many of them Xi’s political rivals, jailed or removed from their positions. And those more familiar with China’s history will remember Mao Zedong’s purges during the Cultural Revolution, which even ensnared future Chinese leaders like Deng Xiaoping.

Another high-ranking military official with the CMC, Liu Zhenli, was also recently removed from his post and placed under investigation like Zhang. The other vice chairman of the CMC, [He Weidong](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3329429/chinas-no-2-general-he-weidong-expelled-communist-party), was removed for the same cause in October.

Zhang and these other officials’ removal leaves far more questions than answers. Is corruption rampant in Beijing, or is Xi Jinping consolidating military power amid a modernization and buildup of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)? And what could Zhang’s departure mean for the future of Taiwan and the rest of the region as China ramps up its military capabilities in the South China Sea and other contested areas?

Searching to make sense of this stunning development in modern China, we turned to Dimon Liu, a prominent Chinese American human rights and democracy activist, and a frequent writer on Chinese human rights and military strategy.

We asked Liu about what this recent military shake-up can tell us about Xi and what we can glean about the stability of the Chinese Communist Party as we approach 2027, the year Xi has promised to regain control of Taiwan. While many China scholars believe the investigation into Zhang signals a further consolidation of Xi’s power and his increasing distaste for dissent among his ranks, Liu expresses another view: She sees this episode driven not by Xi but by other powerful Communist officials, meaning Xi himself could fall prey to the purge he instigated.

***The following interview has been lightly edited and condensed.***

**Frannie Block**: What are we to make of the ousting of General Zhang Youxia, a close military ally of Xi Jinping?

**Dimon Liu**: It is a naked and more fierce than usual power struggle among the Chinese Communist Party elites. It is far from over—I would not count the winner until the last man is left standing.

So who is doing what to whom?

Here I quote Wei Jingsheng, China’s most famous political dissident, and a second-generation “princeling”—the nickname for Communist Party elites whose parents fought and worked alongside Mao. It’s a group that includes Xi and Zhang, whom Wei grew up with. Here’s what Wei says:

“The power of the Party apparatchiks—the career bureaucrats and officials—has suddenly surged, and the balance within the Party is lost. A comprehensive purge à la the Cultural Revolution begins, but the process is reversed: In the Cultural Revolution, the Party was purged first, using the military to safeguard the process. The cleansing of the military followed. Now, the military has been purged first. So who will safeguard the cleansing of the Party? It could be that the one being purged is really the supreme leader himself.”

Wei Jingsheng is saying here that the Party apparatchiks are the masterminds of the current military purges, and that Xi Jinping didn’t put away Zhang Youxia. In fact, Xi is at risk himself.

Who is the leader of the Party apparatchiks? Wei Jingsheng did not explicitly name the culprit, but Robert Suettinger, my husband and a historian of China, said it could only be [Cai Qi](https://chinese-leaders.org/members/cai-qi/), the second most powerful man in China after Xi.

Wei and Zhang were childhood friends and belonged to a princeling gang that Wei Jingsheng organized and led. Xi and Zhang were not childhood friends, despite reporting to the contrary in the Western press, because 1) Xi’s father was purged, and the family was expelled from the leadership compound when Xi was very young, and 2) Xi and Zhang are not in the same age bracket. It matters when one is young. Who wants to hang out with someone several years younger when one is 10?

**FB**: Have highly ranked military officials been ousted before?

**DL**:Yes, regularly, because the military is the ultimate guarantor of power. Whoever is the paramount leader must control the largest portions of the military.

The People’s Liberation Army isn’t a professional army in historian [Samuel Huntington](https://alphahistory.com/coldwar/historian-samuel-p-huntington/) ’s definition of being apolitical and loyal to the nation. The PLA is very political and factional; its loyalty is not to the nation, but to the Chinese Communist Party; and its professionalism is measured in its lethality, a more ancient definition.

The military is the ultimate guarantor of power. Whoever is the paramount leader must control the largest portions of the military.

However, the scale of purging under Xi appears to be unprecedented. One veteran PLA observer counted several hundred generals sacked since Xi came to power in 2012. Another counted 150 one-star and above generals purged since 2020. My own count is 70, since 2022, when Xi gave himself another five-year term, which is far from complete. Accurate information is hard to come by, because the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is a closed system.

**FB**:Could you describe the difference between party laws and state laws? Are they the same?

**DL**: The PRC was created as a totalitarian state in 1949. It was upheld in the 1982 constitution as a totalitarian state. Deng Xiaoping loosened the grip on the economy, but PRC remains structurally totalitarian.

Power is what counts in a totalitarian state. Laws and rules are in the service of power. Yes, party laws are different from the state laws, and both party and state laws can be more lenient or harsher, depending on who is the tyrant in control.

**FB**:Can this give any indication of a future shift in the People’s Liberation Army priorities and operations?

**DL**:It is much more than a shift. It is a collapse of the current PLA high command. Again, I quote Wei Jingsheng: “The military places too much emphasis on the code of loyalty among brothers. Few in the military know history. So the military will lose. In fact, they have lost—they can’t even protect their own military brothers.”

In January of 2025, Wei told me that Xi, the military, and the political elders had made a compromise to maintain regime stability.

“How long would the compromise hold?” I asked. “A year. A year and a half at most,” Wei replied. But what would happen when the compromise couldn’t hold?

“The CCP will lose its internal balance,” Wei told me, “and chaos in China will follow.”

What Wei is describing here is that the Party apparatchiks have disrupted the compromise, and China may enter into similar rebellions and chaos as is happening in Iran now.

If that happens, the question becomes whether a new PLA military high command can be installed in time to stop it.

**FB:** Were there any known points of tension between Zhang and Xi?

**DL:** Xi Jinping couldn’t have secured another five-year term without the support of Zhang Youxia marshaling the military behind Xi.

Xi Jinping and Zhang Youxia were allies, and they probably share certain similar perspectives as second-generation princelings, but were they friends? It seems unlikely.

Friendships among the CCP power elites are very rare, if not impossible, in a political culture that operates on a “you die, I live” ethos—every CCP power elite would place watching his back over and above any friendships.
