A group representing white and Asian high school and college students filed a complaint Monday in federal court against the University of California claiming nine of its campuses use racial preferences in admissions in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.

The complaint seeks an injunction prohibiting the UC from considering race in student admissions.

It comes on the heels of President Trump’s executive orders banning [diversity equity and inclusion efforts](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trumps-war-on-dei-freezes-diversity-work-across-federal-government-9a596d29?mod=article_inline) from the federal government, and a year and a half after the Supreme Court [ruled it unconstitutional](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/supreme-court-rules-against-affirmative-action-c94b5a9c?mod=article_inline) to consider race in university admissions.

The Supreme Court decision had an uneven impact on enrollment at the nation’s colleges, with several schools [reporting a sharp decline](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/the-colleges-falling-behind-on-black-student-enrollment-f3728f99?mod=article_inline) in the number of Black students admitted.

A University of California spokesperson said that undergraduate admissions applications collect students’ race and ethnicity information only for statistical purposes, not for admission use. “Since the consideration of race in admissions was banned in California in 1996, the University of California has adjusted its admissions practices to comply with the law,” the spokesperson said.

The complaint was filed by a group calling itself Students Against Racial Discrimination, which the suit says was formed “to restore meritocracy in academia.” The lead attorney is Jonathan Mitchell, a former solicitor general of Texas and [the principal architect](https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-texas-abortion-law-an-attorneys-unusual-enforcement-idea-11630762683?mod=article_inline) of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which in 2021 made Texas the most restrictive in the nation for abortion access. Last year Mitchell represented Trump in his fight to stay on the Republican primary ballot in Colorado.

The suit contends the UC reinstated race-based preferences after California passed a 1996 constitutional amendment prohibiting their use in university admissions. That ban prompted a sharp drop in enrollment among Black and Hispanic students at UCLA and UC Berkeley, the system’s most competitive schools.

To counteract this phenomenon, UC invested hundreds of millions of dollars in recruitment efforts. Despite an increase in applicants, admission rates among Black and Hispanic students remained low so the schools reactivated racial preferences, the suit contends.

A 2014 review of admissions records by a UCLA sociologist found that over five years more than 2,000 offers to UCLA were affected by racial preferences benefiting Black and Hispanic undergraduates at the expense of Asian-American and white students, the suit claims. Other UC schools adopted race-based preferences, lifting admission rates for Black and Hispanic students, the suit alleges.

The suit also claims that UC law schools admissions have violated state and federal laws prohibiting racial preference.
