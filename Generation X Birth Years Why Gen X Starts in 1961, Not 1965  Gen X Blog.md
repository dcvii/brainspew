Acalanes High School Class of 1980

##### Acalanes Class of 1980, Lafayette, CA., looking quite preppy and light years from the groovy 1970s. These folks were born 1962-1963.

### The Baby Boom and the Baby Bust

Let’s start with the numbers. The Baby Boom, by any honest measure, ended in 1961. After peaking in 1957, U.S. birthrates declined sharply. The postwar wave of fertility crashed hard, yet the cultural concept of the Baby Boomer plodded on for a few more years, sweeping in people born during the tapering end of the demographic curve.

In the years following the post–World War II Baby Boom, U.S. birth rates declined sharply, ushering in what came to be known as the Baby Bust. Those born during this demographic dip, roughly between 1961 and 1981, were initially labeled the Baby Busters.

### 🧭 A Generation Defined by Absence

I touched on this in the most-read post on this blog, [Who Is Generation X](https://www.jenx67.com/who-is-generation-x). Baby Buster sounds kind of badass, but the label was telling. We weren’t named for what we brought to the world, but for what was missing. Fewer people. Less optimism. A fading sense of promise.

The name reflected more than a population slump. It captured a generation raised in the wake of rising divorce rates, economic turbulence, [latchkey afternoons](https://www.jenx67.com/2009/01/latchkey-generation.html), and cultural whiplash.

### 1961-1964 Problem

The misalignment of those born between 1961 and 1964 is part of the problem. Generational boundaries were retrofitted to census charts, not shaped by lived experience. Demographers drew the Baby Boomer cutoff at 1964, but life doesn’t unfold in neat statistical increments. Cultural memory doesn’t consult actuarial tables. And neither the Social Security Administration [nor astrologers](https://youtu.be/fvVYjupNE0k?feature=shared) get to decide when Generation X begins.

That decision, obviously, falls to me, author of the longest-running Gen X blog on the planet.  
(Bahaha. I jest. Sort of.)

### 🌼 Not Woodstock, Watergate

The people born between 1961 and 1964, like my brother Billy, don’t belong in the same cohort as Woodstock, draft cards, and Kent State. They didn’t fight in Vietnam or watch it unfold in real time. Most of them were in kindergarten when the troops began withdrawing. They came of age in the 1970s, not the 1960s. Their adolescence wasn’t flower power. It was power outage. Also known as rolling blackouts and gas lines. Also, there was disco, Atari, Watergate and divorce.

### 🪖 Too Young To Die in Vietnam, Too Old To Mourn Kurt Cobain

When the draft ended in 1973, the youngest draftees were born in 1955. That means everyone born after that year never faced compulsory service in [Vietnam](https://www.jenx67.com/2025/06/the-impact-of-vietnam-on-generation-x.html). By the time Saigon fell in 1975, those born in 1961 were 14 years old. They didn’t protest the war. They watched it wind down on the evening news.

This matters, because cultural generations are shaped not just by what happens, *but by what happens to you* at a formative age. Gen X is defined in part by the aftermath of the Baby Boom. We were handed a faded version of what the Boomers protested for or against. That experience begins with the tail end of what some call Generation Jones, but what I would argue is better understood as the first wave of Generation X.

### 🍄 No Haight-Ashbury

Those born in 1961–1964 entered adulthood in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They were in the first wave to come of age under Reaganomics. They remember life before cable TV, but also the novelty of MTV. Also, they didn’t drop acid in Haight-Ashbury, they dropped quarters into Pac-Man and Space Invaders.

Although Gen Xers didn’t face the draft, the AIDS Crisis stalked our coming of age. We buried many friends when we were young. If you were spared this chapter and are surprised to learn this it’s largely because in the early days of the crisis there was very little public mourning. There was also very little government support.

Generation X’s peak years of sexual exploration were saturated with confusion, grief and fear, all driven by AIDS. This is very different than the Boomer experience of free love. Someone born in 1961 turned 20 in 1981, the year the CDC first reported what would become known as AIDS. Throughout their twenties, Xers were shadowed by death, perhaps none more than those born in the early 1960s. So, we didn’t go to Vietnam [but we lived in the war zone of AIDS](https://www.jenx67.com/2025/06/the-untold-impact-of-aids-on-generation-x.html).

### No-Man’s Land

Gen-Xers born between 1961 and 1964 have long been stuck in a kind of generational no-man’s-land. They’re too young to feel like part of the 1960s, and too old to relate to the slacker and grunge caricatures often used to define Gen X in the 1990s. They’re overlooked in cultural shorthand, miscategorized in demographic reports, and missing from the emotional heart of both the Boomer and Gen X cohorts.

### It’s Probably Too Late To Be Saying All This

It honestly feels like I’m writing about this 20 years too late. Does it even matter anymore? There was so much I wanted to say when I started writing about Gen X nearly 20 years ago. I just couldn’t because my income was controlled by Baby Boomers who hated this blog. They hated it so much and I was silenced by their disdain for Generation X.

So, I wrote a lot of stuff like, [Vintage Nikes All The Rage As Brand Turns 40. Eek.](https://www.jenx67.com/2011/06/nike-turns-40.html) while I waited for time to pass and the freedom to speak the truth to arrive. I’m still only half way there. Now here I am at 57, advocating for people who are between 61 and 64 years old. But, what I’m really advocating for is history and legacy. We need to get this right.

### 🧭 Generation Jones Detour, Gen X Fully Claimed

The label [Generation Jones](https://www.jenx67.com/2016/11/generation-jones.html) was created by Jonathan Pontell, a cultural historian and political campaign. It was originally coined for a marketing campaign targeted at Americans who were born between 1954 and 1964. It was a worthy endeavor, but Gen Jones has never stuck.

Meanwhile, Gen X has aged into its identity with tremendous pride and clarity. Thanks in large measure to our children (and their memes), we are no longer forgotten. There are so many people writing about Generation X now, it’s hard to believe [we were once so nameless](https://www.jenx67.com/2015/03/a-nameless-unlucky-generation.html). But there was a time, and not that long ago, when I was one of only three bloggers writing consistently about Generation X. I did so not as a historian, but as someone who lived through it. And, I actually have a degree in history, but it’s not my life’s work.

### ✊ So-Called

Have you noticed that Gen Xers no longer preface their cultural critiques with “I’m a member of the *so-called* Generation X.” Nope. It’s just Gen X now. We don’t apologize for our cynicms anymore and we own our weird childhoods, latchkey loneliness and analog adolescence. It is both happy and sad when we refer to ourselves as feral. To be honest, I rather enjoyed being raised by wolves.

So, thank you for reading this far. These pieces take time and don’t go viral. They truly are meant for the few. So, here’s the catch. By insisting that Gen X begins in 1965, we’ve allowed that earliest, most formative wave of our generation to be orphaned. It actually pisses me off when people born in 1979 want to set our Gen X elders adrift in a generation they don’t belong to. It is personal, but it is also academic.

### 📞 Cultural Touchstones

Let’s consider cultural touchstones for a moment. If you were born in 1961, your high school years lined up with Blondie, the Cars, and the Clash. Someone born in 1964 would have been 20 when *The Breakfast Club* came out, two years removed from high school. My brother was born in 1962 and he’s the one who called and said, **“You have to see this movie. The entire thing takes place in a high school library.”** I thought it sounded so boring, but I watched it and I learned so much about my brother. We were five years and worlds apart. He was in the Marines and I was in college, but we were members of the same generation. We were not our Silent Generation parents or our Baby Boomer sisters. We were different. Still, Billy would never quite feel like he belonged. Not a Boomer. Not an Xer.

Nevertheless, he grew up worrying about finding razors in his apples when he went Trick-or–Treating. He was wildly upsupervised throughout his childhood and youth. In his early twenties he watched the Challenger explode just like me, not as a child, but not as parent either.

##### Hate to admit but these were actually quite a treat in our house. Swanson’s TV Dinners. The fried chicken was delicious. 😋

### Between Wars and Benefits

Finally, Billy joined the Marines during the years between wars and great benefits (1977-1985). He was too late for the Vietnam-era GI Bill and too early for the Montgomery version. He served without the educational safety net that shaped generations before and after.

Please refer to my 2015 post, [Why Gen X Men Are Dying](https://www.jenx67.com/2015/11/why-are-generation-x-men-dying.html) and overlay it with everything I just said. I’m very pissed about what happened to Billy, forgotten on the front end but still served during the very Cold War.

### ⚠️ Is This Conversation A Waste of My Time?

Generational boundaries might seem trivial to some, but these lines affect how we understand ourselves. They shape public health data, marketing strategies, political outreach, and even mental health trends. The so-called “Deaths of Despair” rising in midlife are hitting this 1961–64 cohort really hard. They were invisible then, and they’re invisible now.

I wish we could fully reclaim these years once and for all, not as an annex or an afterthought, but as an integral part of Generation X. Gen X didn’t spring fully formed in 1965. *Please*. It emerged in the ashes of idealism and the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement, anti-war protests, flower power and a youth-driven cultural revolution.

What followed was a cooling silence. Idealism burned out and what was left in its wake was disillustioned Gen Xers with 10 percent mortgages and 8 percent student loans.

Those born in the early 1960s were in that wake, blinking in the dusk, removing their TV dinners from the oven. Swanson fried chicken, chewy mixed vegetables and spiced apples. There was never enough. And Boomers always seemed to have always enough.
