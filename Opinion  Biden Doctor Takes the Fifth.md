Matt Brown and Michelle Price [report from](https://apnews.com/article/biden-doctor-kevin-oconnor-testimony-5c2a75c6bec319bb4ff8a417993e3d6c) Washington for the Associated Press:

> President Joe Biden’s former White House physician refused on Wednesday to answer questions as part of the House Republican investigation into Biden’s health in office.

> Dr. Kevin O’Connor invoked his rights under the Fifth Amendment during a closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee, his attorney and lawmakers said.

The committee has [issued a press release](https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-statement-on-dr-oconnor-pleading-the-fifth/) which includes the following statement from House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R., Ky.):

> Dr. O’Connor took the Fifth when asked if he was told to lie about President Biden’s health and whether he was fit to be President of the United States. Congress must assess legislative solutions to prevent such a coverup from happening again. We will continue to interview more Biden White House aides to get the answers Americans deserve.

In a document released by the Biden White House and dated Feb. 28, 2024—just four months before Mr. Biden’s debate performance last June made plain his cognitive limitations—Dr. O’Connor [wrote](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Health-Summary-2.28.pdf):

> As requested by the patient, the following is a summary of the current health status of President Joseph R. Biden. The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.

This outlandish claim arrived three weeks *after* a special counsel at the Biden Justice Department had assessed Mr. Biden as [too forgetful to prosecute](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/special-counsel-biden-too-forgetful-to-prosecute-4d9b3382?mod=article_inline). And of course it had been obvious to many Americans for years before the special counsel’s report that Mr. Biden was dangerously [incoherent in public communication](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-president-should-avoid-public-speaking-11648247289?mod=article_inline).

In making his dubious assertion of Biden fitness, Dr. O’Connor also appealed to the authority of various other people with esteemed medical credentials. What would we do without experts?

Perhaps the Oversight Committee should seek to depose all of them until the American people get a straight answer on Biden cognition and on the question of who was running the U.S. government.

Dr. O’Connor’s report continued:

> As in previous years, I have conducted a comprehensive review of President Biden’s medical history and performed a detailed physical examination. This physical has again included specialty consultation with several of our Presidential Specialty Consultants from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. These specialties have included Optometry, Dentistry, Orthopedics (Foot and Ankle), Orthopedics (Spine), Physical Therapy, Neurology, Sleep Medicine, Cardiology, Radiology and Dermatology. Each of these specialists have independently reviewed the chart, examined the President, and concur with my findings and recommendations. I have also solicited feedback from my respected colleagues – the other physicians in the White House Medical Unit, who see the patient every day. Each of these doctors has reviewed my report for accuracy. My conclusions have been further informed through discussions with several of my fellow professors from the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences.

Even without a request from the Oversight Committee—for the sake of their institutions and the medical profession—doesn’t anyone from Walter Reed or George Washington University want to comment on this farce?

The 2024 O’Connor report concluded:

> President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.

What a disgrace.

**Another Failing Government Institution**

When we think of jurisdictions trying to make the arduous climb out of the depths of progressive social policy, we naturally think of coastal places like San Francisco. But sadly there is a nationwide problem within a particular type of municipal institution. It seems that many of the people responsible for maintaining quiet environments for learning have abandoned their mission in order to prioritize destructive policies on homelessness.

Zac Bissonnette [writes at](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-death-of-the-public-library) the Free Press:

> All over the country, libraries are seeing fewer visitors and more problems. Per-resident visits to public libraries fell by 56.6 percent in the 10 years ending in 2022. Meanwhile, a report from the Urban Libraries Council found that between 2019 and 2023, security incidents rose at its 115 member libraries, even as visits fell another 35 percent… a major reason libraries are in decline is that, as a former librarian wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 2007, libraries have become “a de facto daytime shelter for the city’s homeless.” Indeed, when libraries research what people dislike about their institution, they often find that the homeless population now congregating in the library is the biggest complaint…Rather than resisting their emerging role as social worker and first responder to the homeless, they have embraced it, to the detriment of everyone else who wants to use a library.

At least there is a market solution when government fails. Mr. Bissonnette writes:

> In January, Barnes & Noble announced that it planned to open 60 new locations in 2025—a record—on top of the 57 stores it opened in 2024. In making the announcement, a company spokesperson told People magazine that “Many readers were looking for a place to spend time and connect with other people in their community. Our bookstores became a safe and welcoming space to meet up with friends and explore the stacks.”

> This, of course, is the role libraries have historically played—and should still play. Instead, as libraries look to be “everything to everybody,” as one librarian put it, they are becoming less and less to fewer and fewer people.

> Current practices aren’t solving homelessness, but seem well on their way to destroying the public library. As one anonymous librarian said in response to a survey about mentally ill library guests, “This problem, *not the invention of the internet*, could prove to be the final demise of the public library as we know it.”

**This Week in Windy City Politics**

Another prominent Chicago politician is in the headlines for corruption charges. This time there’s good news for the defendant, though it’s not exactly an exoneration for the longtime member of the Chicago City Council. Jason Meisner [reports for](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/09/judge-rules-ex-ald-carrie-austin-medically-unfit/) the Chicago Tribune:

> A federal judge on Wednesday ruled that former Chicago Ald. Carrie Austin is medically unfit to stand trial on corruption charges, likely ending a case that first came to light when federal agents raided her South Side office more than six years ago…

> Austin, now 76, represented the 34th Ward in the City Council for more than 30 years, making her the body’s second-longest serving member after Ed Burke, who was convicted of sweeping racketeering charges in 2023 and spent about nine months of a two-year sentence in federal prison before being released to community confinement on Tuesday.
