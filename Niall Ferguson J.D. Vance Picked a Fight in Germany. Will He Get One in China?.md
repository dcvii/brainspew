For a man who is said to have his eye on the Nobel Peace Prize, President Donald J. Trump sure is spoiling for a fight.

His administration increasingly reminds me of the character in Stephen Crane’s Wild West short story, “The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky.” Scratchy Wilson prowls the dusty streets of the one-horse town in search of a fight—any fight. The locals take cover, barricading themselves into the Weary Gentleman saloon. Scratchy is reduced to taking pot shots at the barman’s dog and the saloon door. “The man called to the sky. . . . He bellowed and fumed and swayed his revolvers here and everywhere. But “there was no offer of fight—no offer of fight.”

Even before he was sworn in, President Trump was picking fights. Like Scratchy, he started with his neighbors. He threatened 25 percent tariffs on Canada and on Mexico and spoke of annexing the former. Neither counterpunched. Indeed, both caved within days—Mexico by sending 10,000 troops to the border; Canada by appointing a “fentanyl czar” and further expanding its $1.3 billion [border security plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2025/02/government-of-canada-expands-plan-to-strengthen-border-security.html).

Then Trump looked further afield. He demanded the return of the Panama Canal. He asked Denmark to hand over Greenland. He slapped a 10 percent tariff on imports from China. Still, no fight—just a few, limited, tit-for-tat tariffs.

The latest attempt to start a fight—and by the looks of it, the most successful so far— took place at the usually dull Munich Security Conference on Valentine’s Day, when Vice President J. D. Vance challenged not only the European Union but also Britain.

“EU commissars warn citizens that they intend to shut down social media during times of civil unrest,” said Vance, “the moment they spot what they’ve judged to be ‘hateful content.’ ” He went on: “It looks more and more like old, entrenched interests hiding behind ugly, Soviet-era words like *misinformation* and *disinformation*.” And he reeled off multiple examples of EU and UK censorship, cancel culture, and downright authoritarianism.

I enjoyed [the speech](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/02/14/full_speech_vice_president_jd_vance_addresses_munich_security_conference.html). Having last year suggested in these pages that the United States was evincing [late-Soviet characteristics](https://www.thefp.com/p/were-all-soviets-now), I admired the way Vance passed the buck by accusing the Europeans of being the new Soviets.

The very next day, as if to prove Vance’s point, there was a [wild altercation](https://x.com/SpeechUnion/status/1890784778640605650) in London between a man who had set a copy of the Quran on fire, and another man who assaulted the Quran-burner with an enormous knife. The book-burner, Hamit Coskun, has been charged with a “religiously aggravated public order offense.” The knife wielder has been released on bail. The coup de grace: A passerby—a delivery biker—intervened. . . to kick Coskun after he had been knocked to the ground.

We also learned on Saturday that the British authorities have [charged 292 people](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/02/15/hundreds-charged-speech-crimes-jd-vance-warns-civil-liberty/) with spreading illegal “fake news” or sending “threatening communications” since the Online Safety Act came into force in 2023. A total of 67 have been convicted.

I suspect Americans, who live in a country with a First Amendment, will be astonished to learn the details: After three little girls were [stabbed to death](https://apnews.com/article/southport-stabbings-sentencing-axel-rudakubana-c03e5ab59cd2e2f5baf849710c9d6b3d) by a jihadist in Southport last July, there were multiple cases brought against people for social media postings that broke the Online Safety Act. The government deliberately suppressed the fact that the killer, Axel Rudakubana, had been referred to the anti-extremism program “Prevent” three times and was in possession of an al-Qaeda training manual at the time of the murders. Yet people were jailed for claiming online that he was a Muslim immigrant. One man was jailed for three months for a livestreamed video on TikTok that falsely claimed he was “running for his life” from rioters in Derby. ([More examples here](https://www.thefp.com/p/niall-ferguson-the-rot-in-britain).)

In calling this out, Vance was saying more than just that Britain and Europe have forgotten, if they ever really understood, the importance of free expression. He was also making an argument about political liberty. “Of all the pressing challenges that the nations represented here face,” he declared, “I believe there is nothing more urgent than mass migration. . . . No voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants.”

He delivered this message one day after a 24-year-old Afghan national [drove a car](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrl51mz7k8o) into a trade union march not far from the Security Conference, injuring 37 people and killing a 37-year-old woman and her 2-year-old child; and a day before five people were stabbed and a 14-year-old boy killed in Villach in neighboring Austria by a 23-year-old [Syrian asylum seeker](https://apnews.com/article/austria-stabbing-attack-syria-migration-a7b5c09085eacaff68dc738bfa1459fe).

There is a reason many ordinary Europeans who listened to J.D. Vance’s speech loved it, despite the tut-tuts of disapproval from his Eurocrat audience. It resonated with them because the European politicians who call for restrictions on immigration have for so long been stigmatized by the European political establishment.

Instead of listening to the voters, the Europeans at Munich—and journalists across the continent—simply disregarded Vance’s argument and united to complain that his boss had made a telephone call to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as part of Trump’s diplomatic effort to end the war in Ukraine. Even the great Tory journalist [Charles Moore](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/02/14/trump-putin-call-threatens-western-security/) fired a broadside against Trump.

He and others overlooked Vice President Vance’s interview with *The* *Wall Street Journal*, published on Thursday, which [quoted him](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/vance-wields-threat-of-sanctions-military-action-to-push-putin-into-ukraine-deal-da9c18ac?mod=hp_lead_pos1) as saying “that the U.S. would hit Moscow with sanctions and potentially military action if. . . Putin won’t agree to a peace deal with Ukraine that guarantees Kyiv’s long-term independence.” Nor did any of the administration’s critics explain how they thought Trump could negotiate an end to the war without communicating with both Putin and Zelensky, as he did on Wednesday. Henry Kissinger is no longer here to point out that you can’t end a war by speaking only to the side whose territory was invaded.

The foreign policy of the Trump administration has, as the physicists say, emergent properties, because it is the product of a highly complex system still in the process of formation. This has the commentators understandably bamboozled. For [Yaroslav Trofimov](https://www.wsj.com/world/in-a-new-age-of-empire-great-powers-aim-to-carve-up-the-planet-fef072f7) and [Gideon Rachman](https://www.ft.com/content/8d1afb00-57ee-4b59-abe3-df0ff18084fb), Trump is a brazen imperialist. For [Walter Russell Mead](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/maga-world-and-the-western-hemisphere-trump-unites-hawkish-and-restrainer-wings-of-coalition-88068672?mod=hp_opin_pos_4), it’s all about spheres of influence, with Trump staking out the Western Hemisphere. For *[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/01/16/donald-trump-will-upend-80-years-of-american-foreign-policy)*, Trump is Richard Nixon’s revenge—“madman theory” put into practice—but in a way that will ultimately self-sabotage.

Really? The first 19 calls that Marco Rubio made after being confirmed as secretary of state were to India, Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Israel (twice), the “[rightful president](https://www.thefp.com/p/freedom-fighting-venezuela-maria-corina-machado)” of Venezuela, Canada, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, NATO, Costa Rica, Poland, Egypt, China, and Vietnam. Nothing very imperial, hemispherical, or delusional about that list. Secretary Rubio’s first trips have been to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic, followed by Germany, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And remember: We are not even four weeks in. Just 16 of Trump’s nominees for the most consequential jobs in the administration have been confirmed—Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are among the few.

If there is any theme to this first month it is simple: This White House likes to pick fights. So far, from Mar-a-Gaza to the Gulf of America to the shutdown of USAID, no one is fighting back. But that should not be interpreted as evidence of America’s unassailable imperial might. As this administration takes shape, I think four things will come clear.

First, President Trump may imagine himself a new William McKinley, who was not only a committed “Tariff Man” but also the president who acquired Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, plus a protectorate over Cuba. But in reality, America’s strategic situation is much more like that of Britain in the mid-1930s than the United States in the 1890s. The United States has a world-spanning array of overseas commitments and a defense budget exceeding $850 billion by some measures. It also has a debt that exceeds $28 trillion, which costs $881 billion a year in interest. This means that for the first time since the 1920s it is in breach of Ferguson's Law, which states any great power that spends more on debt servicing than on defense risks ceases to be a great power. (More on this in a forthcoming essay.)

Second, while a good deal of attention continues to focus on Gaza, and the president’s bold plan to resettle its population, the Middle East is, in reality, on the eve of a much more important conflict. That is the war that Israel could soon launch to disable the nuclear weapons program of a gravely weakened Iran. Will the president support it? Or will he follow his dovish instincts and seek a deal with Tehran instead? That is just one of the foreign policy fights already brewing within his nascent administration.

Third, ending the war in Ukraine will take much longer than President Trump hopes. That is because Russia has no incentive to agree to a ceasefire as long as it believes its army can grind out a victory; and Ukraine has no incentive either if the West can provide no meaningful security guarantees. Peacemaking is harder than it looks, as *[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-how-wars-end/?sref=ojq9DljU)* [recently noted](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-how-wars-end/?sref=ojq9DljU). Read former Ukrainian foreign secretary Dmytro Kuleba’s grim *[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/6137b633-c3b9-4703-8840-6191388e4092?shareType=nongift)* [interview](https://www.ft.com/content/6137b633-c3b9-4703-8840-6191388e4092?shareType=nongift) from November if you need more persuading.

Fourth, and most importantly, China poses a much more serious threat to American primacy in the Indo-Pacific than most Americans appreciate. Last week, a very different American—the commander of INDOPACOM, Admiral Sam Paparo—gave a [very different speech](https://www.ft.com/content/3a31c037-f74c-4e33-9720-0fdc32f5133b) from Vance’s at the Honolulu Defense Forum.

“We’re very close to that \[point\] where on a daily basis the fig leaf of an exercise could very well hide operational warning,” he said, referring to Chinese naval activity off Taiwan. “Their aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan right now are not exercises as they call them, they are rehearsals. They are rehearsals for the forced unification of Taiwan to the mainland.”

While China, Russia, and North Korea cooperate ever more openly in the region, Paparo continued, “our magazines run low. Our maintenance backlogs grow longer each month. . . We operate on increasingly thin margins for error. Our opponents see these gaps, and they are moving aggressively to exploit them.”

Under these alarming circumstances, it seems extraordinary that anyone on Capitol Hill would hesitate to confirm Elbridge Colby—author of one of the key books on this issue, *[The](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780300268027)* *[Strategy of Denial](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780300268027)*—as undersecretary for policy at Defense. Important though America’s interests may be in the Middle East and Europe, the number-one national security challenge the Trump administration faces is the threat posed to American primacy in the Pacific by the vast arsenal of warships, missiles, and other military hardware that China has amassed in the past decade.

Failure to deter China from making a move against Taiwan would be potentially catastrophic, confronting President Trump with the choice between acquiescing in a Chinese takeover of the island, the vital hub where nearly all the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors are produced, or resisting it at the risk of starting World War III.

In “The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky,” Scratchy Wilson finally runs into the sheriff—the one man in Yellow Sky capable of taking him on. Like Scratchy, the Trump administration is looking for a fight with all comers. But there is one fight it should be laser-focused on avoiding—because right now, a fight with China over Taiwan is the one fight the United States could lose.
