I'm somewhat liberated and doing more heads up work these days. Taking an opportunity to do a bit of coding reminds me that I have gotten rusty. So I will be burning more time doing the tech thing because as much as I think I can remember, there is no substitution for muscle memory. So it's time for me to flex a bit more. I'm also becoming convinced more and more that a ridiculously large portfolio is more than the sum of its parts. And so that gives me license to code in Rails and Javascript, two frameworks I have long considered beneath me. And yet what has gone on with HTML and a dozen other things has caught me flat footed. So better for me to stick to pushups, as pedestrian as that may be, than worry about buying the wrong size kettlebell. In otherwords, I'm just doing, and will let the doing speak for itself. Glad I remembered this. It has been more than ten years since I've uttered the word 'scaffolding'. My bad. I'll be prototyping, because that needs doing.
