Somewhere I saw a comprehensive document of Obama's drone strikes.

You're likely thinking of one of the major investigative reports or leaked document collections on Barack Obama's drone strike program during his presidency (2009–2017). Obama's administration dramatically expanded the use of armed drones for targeted killings, authorizing an estimated 473–563 strikes (mostly in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia) that killed between 2,372 and 3,797 people, including 384–807 civilians, according to various tallies from independent trackers. These figures vary due to differing methodologies for counting "strikes" (e.g., CIA vs. military) and verifying casualties, but the scale was about 10 times higher than under George W. Bush.Here are the most comprehensive publicly available "documents" or compilations on this topic, based on declassified materials, leaks, and data aggregation. I've prioritized those that function like detailed reports with timelines, strike logs, and policy insights:1\. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism's Drone Warfare Database (Most Detailed Strike Log)
- Description: This is probably the closest to a "comprehensive document" you might have seen—it's an exhaustive, searchable database and accompanying reports compiling every known U.S. drone strike under Obama (and beyond). It includes dates, locations, casualty estimates (militants, civilians, and children), and sources for verification. The Bureau tracked 563 strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, with granular breakdowns like 431 in Pakistan (946–2,200 deaths, including 257–634 civilians).
- Key Highlights:
	- Pakistan peaked at 128 strikes in 2010, killing at least 89 civilians.
	- Yemen: 158 strikes, 1,100–1,300 deaths (115–149 civilians).
	- Somalia: 14 strikes, 3–12 deaths (0–3 civilians).
- Access: Full database and reports at [thebureauinvestigates.com/projects/drone-war](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/projects/drone-war). Their 2017 summary report, "Obama’s covert drone war in numbers," is a 10-page PDF-style overview.
- Why Comprehensive?: It's the gold standard for journalists and researchers, drawing from local media, NGO reports, and official leaks.
2\. The Intercept's "The Drone Papers" (Leaked Internal Documents)
- Description: A 2015 whistleblower leak (from Edward Snowden's source network) of 390+ classified U.S. military documents detailing the inner workings of Obama's drone program. Published as a series of articles with embedded docs, it reveals nomination processes for "kill lists," strike criteria (e.g., "signature strikes" based on patterns, not identities), and error rates (e.g., up to 90% of deaths in some Afghanistan strikes were unintended). Covers Yemen, Somalia, and Afghanistan operations.
- Key Highlights:
	- Documents show the JSOC (Joint Special Operations Command) task force TF 48-4 conducted many strikes.
	- Internal assessments admitted high civilian risks, like a 2011 Yemen strike killing 21 children.
	- Includes the "kill chain" bureaucracy and how targets were approved by the White House.
- Access: Full archive at [theintercept.com/drone-papers](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/). Downloadable PDFs of memos like "Siren Hit List" and "Yemen: A Puzzle with Missing Pieces."
- Why Comprehensive?: Actual secret docs, not just summaries—unprecedented glimpse into the "assassination program."
3\. Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG): "The Drone Playbook" (Official Declassified Policy)
- Description: The Obama administration's 2013 internal guidelines for drone strikes and targeted killings outside active war zones, declassified in 2016 via an ACLU FOIA lawsuit. This 18-page "playbook" outlines rules like presidential approval for U.S. citizens, "near certainty" of no civilian deaths, and capture feasibility before lethal force.
- Key Highlights:
	- Strikes only if capture is "not feasible" and the target poses an "imminent threat."
	- Obama personally approved strikes on U.S. persons (e.g., Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011).
	- Doesn't apply to CIA strikes in Pakistan (about 40% of total).
- Access: PDF available on the White House archives or ACLU site: [obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ppg\_procedures\_for\_the\_use\_of\_lethal\_force\_in\_foreign\_areas.pdf](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ppg_procedures_for_the_use_of_lethal_force_in_foreign_areas.pdf).
- Why Comprehensive?: It's the official rulebook, showing how the program was "institutionalized."
Additional Context and Comparisons For a quick overview of totals across sources:

| Source | Total Strikes |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 540 | 3,797 | 324 |
|  | 563 | 3,252–4,381 | 384–807 |
|  | 542 | 3,106 | 257–644 |
|  |  | 2,200+ |  |

If none of these match what you saw (e.g., if it was a specific PDF or government report), it might be the 2016 "Summary of Information Regarding U.S. Drone Strikes Outside Areas of Active Hostilities" from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence— a shorter annual tally (not as comprehensive). Let me know more details for a deeper dive!
