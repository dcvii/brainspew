*Welcome to a new semester Trojans! If you’d like to get more involved in our chapter at USC, please contact us at heterodox.usc@gmail.com.*

A new **[“State of the Chief Diversity Officer”](https://nadohe.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/resources/NADOHE-2025-State-of-the-CDO.pdf)** survey from the **[National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education](https://www.nadohe.org/)** provides some interesting details on how Chief Diversity Offices (CDOs) have been doing over the past two years.

A **[James G. Martin center analysis](https://jamesgmartin.center/2026/01/chief-diversity-officers-are-sad/)** noted that little seems to have changed. Of those who said that their role or its duties had changed, just 8% of CDOs said that their position had been discontinued entirely. Less than 15% said that their office had been dismantled or eliminated.

However, these responses were collected between February 4 and March 17, 2025, shortly after Trump took office in January. Many universities, including USC, were slow to implement directives from Trump. It wasn’t until the fall that changes such as rebranding of our DEI offices and some shuffling of roles, took place.

It will probably be much more useful to look at these sorts of reports in another year or two to really understand Trump’s impact.

At present, our most high-profile DEI lobbyist, **[Shaun Harper](https://rossier.usc.edu/faculty-research/directory/shaunharper)** of the **[USC Race and Equity Center](https://race.usc.edu/)**, is doing well. He was recently **[ranked #3 on](https://race.usc.edu/2026/01/06/harper-achieves-highest-scholar-influence-ranking-top-again-in-education-policy/)** ***[Education Week’s](https://race.usc.edu/2026/01/06/harper-achieves-highest-scholar-influence-ranking-top-again-in-education-policy/)*** **[list](https://race.usc.edu/2026/01/06/harper-achieves-highest-scholar-influence-ranking-top-again-in-education-policy/)** of “most influential scholars.” For those who missed it, this past summer he testified before Congress:

Universities are certainly paying a lot of lip service to “viewpoint diversity” and “free expression” with events and speeches these days. However, few seem to be actually adding much in the way of *permanent* viewpoint diversity, via tenure-track hires, yet.

A few are erecting “civic centers” which hire more politically diverse faculty. This is often done to circumvent established departments who have no interest in hiring non-progressive faculty. They use cries of “academic freedom violation!” to block any attempts to force them to do so.

Civic centers are certainly better than nothing, but it’s effectively avoiding the real crisis: how to dismantle ideologically-captured departments and centers across our campuses without descending into partisanship of another kind. More assertive action is needed, but that will require university leaders to take the problem seriously. We suspect most aren’t all that interested.

#### Upcoming USC Events:

#### The Importance of Free Expression in an Ever-Changing World

Tuesday, March 24 | 5:30 PM | Town and Gown  
Hosted by the USC Price School of Public Policy

In a world of cancel culture, safe spaces, and “words are violence,” what is the future of free expression? What is gained by prioritizing free expression, and what is lost by allowing it to wither away? Our guests speak to the challenges free expression faces in the modern world and how our lives in the academy, business, and society might change as a result.  
Speakers include **[Rikki Schlott](https://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/rikki-schlott/)**, New York Post columnist and co-author of *The Canceling of the American Mind* and **[Ian Rosenberg](https://www.ian-rosenberg.com/bio)**, media lawyer and author of *The Fight for Free Speech: Ten Cases That Define Our First Amendment Freedoms.*
