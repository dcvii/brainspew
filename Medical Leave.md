### The Mooch Report—January 27, 2026

This week we posted a couple videos hosted by friends of the channel after Mooch took a little medical leave for a procedure.

Frequent co-host retired Navy Capt. Kevin “Hozer” Miller posted an excellent video about the historical significance of the Essex Class aircraft carrier, while our favorite tanker pilot, Lt. Col. Mark “Sluggo” Hasara, dove deep into the seizures of ‘Ghost Fleet’ tankers.

But back in the saddle, Mooch posted a great video detailing the upcoming mission to the moon—the first time in over 50 years the US has been back to our nearest neighbor, and a mission that’s been severely underreported by the major media.

Stay tuned for updates throughout the week, and as always, keep us posted on your suggestions and tips in the comments.

The Institute for the Study of War has an excellent analysis of the Russian war in Ukraine, stating: *Kremlin officials continue to reiterate Russia’s commitment to its original war aims and reject Western security guarantees for Ukraine, amid continued reporting that negotiations will resume in the coming days*.

It’s an excellent read and gets you right up to speed on what the situation is on the battlefield.

T.J. Cooney, the host of the " [I Need More Space](https://www.youtube.com/@INeedMoreSpace) " YouTube channel, rejoins Mooch to discuss the Artemis II mission, the space race against China, and how NASA should get more credit for doing as much as they are with a relatively small budget and very little national attention.

Retired Air Force KC-135 pilot and frequent channel guest Lt. Col. Mark "Sluggo" Hasara guest hosts to provide deep intel about the U.S. military's seizures of tankers that are part of the "ghost fleet," vessels carrying illicit materials including oil in order to get around international sanctions placed on Russia, Iran, and China.

Retired Navy Capt. Kevin "Hozer" Miller, a veteran carrier aviator and noted author, guest hosts for an in-depth look at the Essex Class aircraft carrier. From winning the war in the Pacific to training future Naval Aviators toward the end of the 20th Century, these ships demonstrated unmatched toughness and flexibility when the nation needed it most.
