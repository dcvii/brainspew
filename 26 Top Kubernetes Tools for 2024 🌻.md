Looking to hide highlights? You can now hide them from the ‚Äú‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Äù menu.

Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration tool, but it gets even better when combined with other tools. The Kubernetes ecosystem contains a huge range of tools for the command line, simplifying cluster management, monitoring, security, and deployment tasks. With so many options, it can be unclear which you should use when, or what the benefits are.

In this round-up, we‚Äôll tour 25+ leading tools that support your Kubernetes clusters. We‚Äôll explain each tool‚Äôs key features and how it improves your Kubernetes experience.

Kubernetes is a powerful platform with robust functionality for running containers at scale in production-grade environments. However, while it wraps containers with some higher-level concepts, it‚Äôs still a complex system that lacks crucial components required for real-world applications.

Ecosystem tools plug these gaps. They make it easier to integrate Kubernetes with your other DevOps processes, such as by supporting GitOps and [CI/CD-driven deployment](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-ci-cd). Kubernetes tools can also help simplify Kubernetes itself by allowing you to conveniently provision new clusters, inspect your workloads, and monitor utilization and costs.

## Top 26 Kubernetes tools üî•

Establishing a robust Kubernetes toolchain allows you to interact with your clusters and workloads with optimum efficiency. To select the right tools, you should evaluate different options that offer the features you require, then assess their popularity, reliability, and how well they integrate with other solutions you‚Äôre using.

## 1\. Spacelift

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*nB9mHsc19oNbvah3)

[Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/) is the most flexible Infrastructure as a Code management platform, providing powerful CI/CD for your infrastructure. Your team can collaborate on infrastructure changes right from your pull requests. Spacelift lets you visualize your resources, enable self-service access, and protect against configuration drift.

Use Spacelift to manage your Kubernetes clusters without directly interacting with your cloud providers or IaC tools like Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi, or CloudFormation. For example, you can create a Spacelift stack that provisions a new AWS EKS cluster with Terraform, giving team members the ability to safely test their changes on demand.

Spacelift also has you covered when it comes to deploying a cluster and then deploying your application inside it. To learn more, check out: [How to Maintain Operations Around Kubernetes Cluster](https://spacelift.io/blog/how-to-maintain-operations-around-kubernetes-cluster).

## 2\. Kubectl

[Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl) is the definitive Kubernetes tool. It‚Äôs the official CLI so most Kubernetes users will frequently interact with it. Compared to manually calling the Kubernetes API, Kubectl makes it much easier to list your cluster‚Äôs resources, add new objects, and apply declarative state changes.

```
kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
```

Nonetheless, few users take the time to fully learn Kubectl. Mastering the available commands and options can make operations quicker and easier, improving your cluster management experience. Kubectl can also provide detailed documentation that helps you learn more about Kubernetes and your resources without having to leave your terminal.

Check out our [Kubectl Commands & Objects Cheat Sheet](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-cheat-sheet).

## 3\. Helm

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*FQdcV-aA5QHeZpFV)

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a Kubernetes package management solution. It allows you to bundle your Kubernetes manifests as reusable units called charts. You can then install charts in your clusters to easily manage versioned releases and ensure that app dependencies are available.

Helm charts can also be shared with others through centralized repositories. This allows you to distribute your Kubernetes apps without making users manually modify and apply YAML files. Helm is, therefore, the ideal solution for adding Kubernetes support to an app, including all of its components, config options, and dependencies.

## 4\. Kustomize

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*oNurhQMpVISl-n1b)

[Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) is a configuration management tool that lets you customize the objects defined in Kubernetes YAML files each time they‚Äôre used. You can create a base configuration, then override it with custom layers that provide unique options for different environments such as production or staging.

Kustomize provides declarative configuration management that acts as a simple but flexible alternative to a Helm chart. Each of your overrides is created as its own YAML file, making them fully compatible with GitOps and IaC workflows. Read more: [Kustomize vs. Helm ‚Äî How to Use & Comparison](https://spacelift.io/blog/kustomize-vs-helm).

## 5\. kube ns and kube ctx

`[kube ns](https://github.com/weibeld/kubectl-ns)` and `[kube ctx](https://github.com/weibeld/kubectl-ctx)` are a pair of Kubectl plugins that make it much more convenient to work with multi-tenant Kubernetes environments. You can use `kube ns <namespace-name>` to switch between namespaces, while `kube ctx <context-name>` changes your active cluster context ‚Äî letting you effortlessly move between tenants without any long-winded `-n/--namespace` flags or `kubectl config` commands.

## 6\. Kubernetes Dashboard

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*i6xRqHy7PJQYTGuy)

[Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) is the official Kubernetes web interface. It provides [a visual overview of](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-dashboard) the workload objects in your cluster, allowing you to quickly monitor resources, change scaling options, and check Node-level CPU and memory utilization. The Dashboard is a great alternative to Kubectl when you don‚Äôt want to remember complex terminal commands.

## 7\. Lens

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*KkwvTZsxPDleUC26)

[Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) is another Kubernetes management tool with a powerful visual interface. It‚Äôs a desktop app that aims to offer an IDE-like Kubernetes experience. Lens‚Äôs features include support for Helm charts, app templates, metrics monitoring across several engines, and seamless multi-cluster connectivity. You can also use Lens to control [Kubernetes RBAC](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-rbac) configs and invite team members to your clusters.

[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable) is a continuous delivery (CD) solution that makes it easier to automate app deployments to your Kubernetes clusters. It uses a GitOps strategy to periodically sync changes directly from your Git repositories. Argo also defends against configuration drift by regularly verifying that the objects in your cluster match those defined in your repository.

[ArgoCD](https://spacelift.io/blog/argocd) comes with a robust CLI and web interface. It allows you to take control of your Kubernetes deployments without directly exposing cluster access to developers.

## 9\. Argo Rollouts

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*11QSg0IaiI22WfnX)

[Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/rollouts) enables progressive app delivery to your clusters. It lets you increase deployment safety by using strategies such as blue-green, canary, and experimental rollouts. You can declaratively configure your rollouts and the criteria that let them proceed, such as initially exposing a new release to 50% of users and gradually expanding the rollout based on time delays, metrics, or manual actions.

## 10\. Flux

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*bv9AN9eBt68h5UCk)

[Flux CD](https://fluxcd.io/) provides a toolkit of components for implementing GitOps-powered continuous delivery to your Kubernetes clusters. Similarly to ArgoCD, it automatically reconciles your cluster‚Äôs state to your Git repositories and other sources, while preventing drift.

Flux is simple to configure, easy to integrate with IaC solutions, and supported by a strong ecosystem of compatible tools and platforms.

## 11\. Kubecost

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*NE8_QGBK546sz3du)

Cost management is one of the most frequently encountered Kubernetes challenges.

[Kubecost](https://www.kubecost.com/) solves this problem by providing real-time insights into the costs accrued by your Kubernetes clusters running in the cloud. It lets you monitor costs over time, check which workloads are having the biggest cost impact, and identify potential savings options.

Read more about [Kubecost and how to use it](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubecost).

## 12\. Amazon EKS

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*LUKuEKqCtcgn0_ng)

Amazon‚Äôs [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) is a managed Kubernetes service that allows you to [provision new clusters in AWS](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-on-aws) within minutes. EKS automatically manages your cluster‚Äôs control plane and Nodes, letting you concentrate on deploying your workloads. This eliminates many of the challenges associated with starting, maintaining, and updating your own clusters, so it‚Äôs ideal when you want Kubernetes without the administration overheads.

[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) is another managed Kubernetes service that lets you spin up new cloud clusters on demand. It‚Äôs specifically designed to help you run Kubernetes workloads without specialist Kubernetes expertise, and it includes a range of optional features that provide more automation for admin tasks. These include powerful capabilities around governance, compliance, security, and configuration management, all of which can be challenging to implement if you‚Äôre directly managing your own clusters.

## 14\. Terraform

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*v81iH5r_HdiCZDMu)

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a leading Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to [automate cloud provisioning](https://spacelift.io/blog/what-is-terraform) and management activities.

For Kubernetes users, Terraform can create new clusters in any cloud based on consistent config files you version in a Git repository. Terraform can also be used to deploy workloads inside your cluster, such as from Kubernetes manifest files or Helm charts.

## 15\. Prometheus

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*xypCnHGbcS36W1n3)

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is the best-known time-series database engine. It has many use cases, but in the context of Kubernetes, it‚Äôs a great way to store and query metrics that provide observability for your cluster and its workloads. You can receive alerts when metrics change, such as a Node CPU usage spike or a Pod failure, and integrate with tools like Grafana to visualize your values on dashboards.

Kubernetes doesn‚Äôt include any monitoring solution by default, so Prometheus is commonly used to add these crucial missing capabilities. See [how to set up Prometheus monitoring for the Kubernetes cluster](https://spacelift.io/blog/prometheus-kubernetes).

## 16\. Istio

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*HrMyQDFaAgiQdwN2)

[Istio](https://istio.io/) is a service mesh that enables simpler networking, traffic management, service discovery, and monitoring for your Kubernetes clusters. It coordinates communications between your app‚Äôs microservices, providing much more control than the plain Kubernetes Service model.

Istio offers application-aware networking that understands your app‚Äôs requirements. It uses the [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) to abstract the underlying networking environment and facilitate universal traffic management.

## 17\. Loki

[Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) is a log collation tool from the Grafana family of observability solutions. It aggregates, groups, and labels logs from your applications, helping you troubleshoot problems and monitor activity. Although Loki is a general-purpose tool, it‚Äôs well-suited to Kubernetes and comes with several Kubernetes-specific features. It automatically scrapes and indexes metadata from your Kubernetes workload objects, such as Pod labels, to accompany your Pod logs.

## 18\. Metrics Server

[Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) is a Kubernetes addon that collects CPU and memory resource utilization information at the Node and Pod level. It‚Äôs a lightweight, single-cluster, Kubernetes-only alternative to more complex monitoring solutions like Prometheus.

Metrics Server support is integrated with Kubectl. Its data can be accessed via the kubectl top command. Metrics Server is required to use Kubernetes auto-scaling features, including [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-hpa-horizontal-pod-autoscaler) and [Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler), so it‚Äôs a best practice addition to production clusters.

## 19\. Portainer

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*05OMaUBRg9QiERg0)

[Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) is a container management platform that provides a powerful web interface to administer your workloads. It natively supports Kubernetes environments to help you manage your Pods, Deployments, Helm charts, and other cluster resources. Portainer also provides robust RBAC capabilities and an external authentication layer, letting you grant team members access to Kubernetes through Portainer without directly exposing your cluster.

## 20\. Rancher

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*HImA2h4fgaV81eo-)

SUSE‚Äôs [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) is a Kubernetes management tool that‚Äôs targeted at enterprise use. It provides a centralized platform for managing your Kubernetes clusters across cloud providers and on-premises datacenters. You can provision new clusters, monitor your workloads, and conduct security scans to efficiently govern your environments and maintain compliance.

Rancher is a good tool to use when you‚Äôre running Kubernetes at scale and are struggling to move between separate platforms.

## 21\. Ingress NGINX

Ingress resources are crucial to Kubernetes networking: they allow you to expose apps externally using HTTP routes. However, to use Ingress, you need an Ingress controller in your cluster. [Ingress NGINX](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-ingress) is the most popular choice ‚Äî it‚Äôs fast, powerful, and easy to configure.

As the name implies, Ingress NGINX works by using an NGINX web server to reverse proxy incoming requests to your Kubernetes services. The proxy routes are automatically configured from the Ingress resources you add to your cluster. If you want a simple Ingress solution that works across multiple cluster distributions, then Ingress NGINX could be right for you.

## 22\. Minikube

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*IPOPcUSkmoOIW7RU)

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs) makes it easy to start your own local cluster. With one command, you can bring up a complete Kubernetes environment on your workstation, letting you conveniently develop your project and test deployments.

Minikube can run your cluster‚Äôs components as a virtual machine, container, or bare-metal on your host. Bundled add-ons make it simple to enable advanced optional features, including Ingress, Istio, Elastic Stack, and GPU support, so it‚Äôs ideal for Kubernetes newcomers and experienced users alike.

## 23\. K3s

[K3s](https://k3s.io/) is another compact Kubernetes distribution. Developed by SUSE, it‚Äôs packaged as a single binary that comes in at less than 70MB. Despite this tiny footprint, K3s is certified as compatible with upstream Kubernetes, is ready for production use, and supports high availability.

K3s is equally well-suited to local development use and real-world applications scaled across hundreds of Nodes. The small binary size also makes K3s ideal for heavily resource-constrained environments, including IoT devices.

## 24\. Kind

[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is our third tool that can be used to start a Kubernetes cluster, but this one has a slightly different focus. It lets you run Kubernetes environments in Docker containers, with each container acting as a Node.

It‚Äôs intended to make it easier to test cluster behavior when developing Kubernetes itself, so you might benefit from using it if you plan to contribute features. Kind can also be a good alternative to Minikube if you already have Docker installed.

## 25\. K9s

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*HVcoHcOMssBEgLQJ)

Looking for a terminal-based Kubernetes experience but one that‚Äôs a bit more sophisticated than Kubectl? [K9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a complete terminal UI that lets you monitor, manage, and benchmark your Kubernetes workloads. It offers a versatile dashboard-like interface in your console.

K9s is customizable with different views and columns, letting you easily access the information you need. It‚Äôs heavily dependent on aliases and hotkeys to quickly navigate the interface. You can also add skins and plugins that extend the tool‚Äôs functionality.

## 26\. Kube-bench

[kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench) is an automated tool that scans your cluster to check it meets security best practices. The checks are configured as YAML files, which allow you to easily customize tests and add new ones. The default ruleset is based on the [Kubernetes CIS Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes) standard.

Running kube-bench regularly allows you to audit your cluster‚Äôs security and identify any possible threats. Repeat the tests after you‚Äôve made changes to demonstrate that you‚Äôve removed the risk and restored your cluster to compliance.
