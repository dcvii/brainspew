**Jeff Bezos**, the billionaire founder of Amazon and owner of *The Washington Post*, announced that he would be taking the storied newspaper in a new direction that had compelled his editorial page editor to resign in a stunning statement released on Wednesday.

“I shared this note with the *Washington Post* team this morning,” began Bezos [on X](https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088) before sharing the text of his address to employees:

> I’m writing to let you know about a change coming to our opinion pages.
> 
> We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.
> 
> There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.
> 
> I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity.
> 
> I offered **David Shipley**, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t “hell yes,” then it had to be “no.” After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won’t be easy, and it will require 100% commitment — I respect his decision. We’ll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.
> 
> I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America. I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I’m excited for us together to fill that void.

Bezos’s exercise of greater control over the *Post*‘s journalism in recent months has raised eyebrows. Last fall, a number of prominent *Post* writers and alumni criticized Bezos for preventing the paper’s editorial board from endorsing **Kamala Harris** for president, [writing](https://www.mediaite.com/media/jeff-bezos-writes-rare-op-ed-defending-washington-post-non-endorsement-amid-subscriber-exodus/) in an op-ed that “Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” and “create a perception of bias.”
