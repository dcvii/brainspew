Years ago China imported almost no oil from Venezuela due to a lack of heavy crude refining facilities. Since the establishment of a strategic partnership between the two nations, China invested tens of billions to strengthen cooperation. Specifically, in 2023, the China-Venezuela Petrochemical Plant (中委石化) was built in Jieyang, Guangdong (广东揭阳). This 20-million-ton-per-year integrated refining and chemical project is the flagship of the China-Venezuela strategic cooperation (referred to as the "China-Venezuela Project"). It was designed specifically to refine Venezuelan Merey-16 heavy crude. By 2025, it was expected that Venezuela would provide 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the Jieyang refinery, accounting for over 90% of Venezuela's total exports.

​Now that Trump has taken control of Venezuela, he has "killed two birds with one stone." The U.S. military has already secured Venezuelan shipping ports (such as the Port of Jose). Consequently, the China-Venezuela Jieyang plant has been cut off from its supply; facing a total lack of oil to refine, the facility is now at risk of becoming obsolete.

​By securing this supply, the U.S. can not only feed its own refineries—satisfying their "hunger" for heavy crude—but also intercept the flow of Venezuelan oil to China. This effectively "throttles" Chinese refineries, delivering a precision strike against China's core heavy oil import strategy while simultaneously seizing control over global heavy oil pricing power.

​Well, yes, President Trump has offered reassurances that he will guarantee China’s heavy oil supply, but who knows how much will be supplied and under which condition? This "guaranteed supply" will become a strategic bargaining chip for America likely used to pressure China into "oil-for-debt" or "oil-for-tariffs" swaps. Furthermore, while Venezuelan oil was previously purchased using Chinese currency RMB (Yuan), it will inevitably return to USD settlement, ensuring dominance over petroleum finance.

China is a big loser, this is for sure.

China is historically always been a loser.
