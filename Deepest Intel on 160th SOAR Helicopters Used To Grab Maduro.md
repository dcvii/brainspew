### JUST POSTED: February 5, 2026

The journey of becoming a part of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known for its impeccable skills and unique missions, is one very few aviators experience. Greg Calvert, a retired pilot who spent a significant part of his career in the special operations community, offers a unique perspective. Calvert’s transition from being an infantry medic in the 82nd Airborne Division to a revered helicopter pilot was neither straightforward nor planned. His realization of wanting to be an aviator came in a rather dramatic setting; while hiding in the humid, cold woods, he witnessed Cobra helicopters soaring above him and decided he wanted to be up there with them, not rooted in the mud below. Calvert’s journey to flight school and ultimately joining the elite 160th SOAR stemmed from his tenacious pursuit of excellence, propelled by mentors who saw potential and encouraged him to aim higher.

The process to join the ranks of the 160th SOAR is tailored to evaluate more than just technical flying skills. It places a premium on personality and fit with the unit’s tight-knit culture. As Calvert explains, the selection process is not about already being the best aviator; it’s about demonstrating the potential to be molded into one. His ability to transition between different aircraft, from the Blackhawk to the Chinook, exemplifies the regiment’s focus on versatility and cross-training, shaping their pilots to meet a diverse array of mission demands, whether in reconnaissance or high-stakes insertions.

The intricacies of planning and executing high-profile missions require detailed coordination and forethought, a hallmark of operations involving the 160th. Calvert offers insights into the meticulous process, where mission success relies on rigorously planning every detail, accounting for everything from terrain navigation to intervisibility with hostile forces.

In operations such as the one recently conducted in Venezuela, seamless coordination among various units and platforms—whether Army, Navy, or Air Force—is vital. The role of the mission survivability officer, focusing on both offensive and defensive measures to preserve aircraft integrity and mission efficacy, further highlights the complexity behind each successful operation, reinforcing how every crew member, pilot, and planner play a crucial role in the operation’s success.
