**We love data. And we love getting data good and tight and comprehensive.**

The technical term for that is “juicy”. Juicy data. In fact, 80% of the work involved in creating an infographic is data-gathering, shaping and checking. Making the data juicy.

So here, naturally, is a big-ass spreadsheet of all our best data.

You can also view the [original Google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgDZ6_JMqfO0dGFobzhJMXdkdkJPN0JqOXl5Slg4b0E#gid=1).

Here’s all [365 datasets for Beautiful News Daily](https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/data/) too!
