What do you know about Pilot Executive Software run by David Friend

Pilot Executive Software appears to be a historical or defunct entity closely tied to Pilot Software, Inc., a pioneering business intelligence and analytics company founded in the early 1980s. Based on available records, it was likely an early operational arm, subsidiary, or branding variant of Pilot Software, focused on executive-level decision-support tools. It operated primarily in the U.S., with incorporations noted in Massachusetts (as Pilot Software, Inc., active from 1983 to 2008) and a branch in the District of Columbia (as Pilot Executive Software, Inc., marked inactive). A Texas branch under the Pilot Software name ran from 1989 to 2005. The company specialized in multidimensional databases (OLAP technology) for handling large-scale customer data analysis, particularly for retail and enterprise users—innovation that predated modern BI tools like those from SAP or Oracle.David Friend, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of Pilot Software, played a central role in its leadership and vision. With a background in engineering (Yale, B.S.) and music composition, Friend brought technical expertise from his early work in electronics and synthesizers (e.g., as president of ARP Instruments in the 1970s). He co-founded Pilot alongside Jeff Flowers in the mid-1980s, positioning it as an independent innovator in data analytics software. Under Friend's influence, Pilot developed products like PilotWorks, which evolved into enterprise performance management solutions.Key Milestones for Pilot Software (and Pilot Executive Software)

Post-acquisition, the Pilot brand faded, but its technology influenced SAP's analytics portfolio. Friend transitioned to other ventures, co-founding companies like FaxNet (fax-to-email pioneer), Sonexis (VoIP conferencing), Carbonite (cloud backup, sold for $1.4B in 2019), and Wasabi Technologies (hot cloud storage, where he remains CEO). He's also a noted philanthropist, supporting music institutions like Berklee College of Music (with a concert hall named after him) and the Yale Peabody Museum.No active operations or recent mentions of "Pilot Executive Software" exist today—it's largely a legacy from the pre-cloud era of analytics. If this refers to a different entity (e.g., a modern startup), further details could clarify, but records point to this historical context.
