St. Patrick’s Day primer for the Non-Irish:

1. It’s St. Paddy’s Day not “Patty’s Day”. Patty is short for Patricia not Pádraig (Patrick in English)!

2. NO GREEN BEER! If you are drinking the proper beer (Stout) green dye doesn’t really work anyway.

3. A shamrock has “3” leaves not “4”. Four leaves means good luck. Three leaves represent St. Patrick.

4. Do not say “Cheers” when toasting, say "Sláinte” (pronounced slan-cha). Cheers is “English” not “Irish”.

5. There is no such thing as Scots-Irish. You are either Irish or Scottish or you’re half Irish and half Scottish.

6. Bag Pipes are SCOTTISH, the IRISH version of the pipes are called Uilleann. Google it if you are interested in the difference.

7. Do not order a Black and Tan. The Black and Tan were a force of temporary police recruited to assist the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during the Irish War of Independence and are not thought of fondly by the Irish people as they committed innumerable acts of violence against Irish civilians. It’s about like going into a Jewish Deli and ordering a "Brown Shirt" sandwich!

8. Don’t order an “Irish Car Bomb”; it’s just plain tacky.

9. Feel free to use the term “Pog mo Thoin” (pronounced pogue-mo-hone) often. It’s Irish for “kiss my arse”.

10. Lastly, have fun and don’t be a sloppy drunk. No one likes a sloppy drunk, especially the Irish.

Happy St. Patrick’s Day!!!
