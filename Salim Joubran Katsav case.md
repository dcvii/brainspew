## Salim Joubran

Here are more detailed facts about Salim Joubran — his background, his role in the case of Moshe Katsav, and his legacy.

---

### Early life and career

- Joubran was born in 1947 in Haifa (in what was then Mandatory Palestine) into a Christian-Maronite Arab family.
- He studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and was admitted to the bar in 1970.
- From 1970-1982 he worked in private practice. Then in 1982 he was appointed to the Haifa Magistrate’s Court; in 1993 to Haifa District Court; and in 2003 he was appointed (initially temporarily) to the Supreme Court of Israel, becoming a permanent justice in 2004.
- He retired from the Supreme Court in 2017 (having reached mandatory retirement age) and died in 2024 at age 76.

---

### Significance & firsts

- He was **the first Arab-Israeli** (specifically Arab Christian) to receive a *permanent* appointment to the Supreme Court of Israel.
- Beyond the bench, he chaired Israel’s Central Elections Committee, marking another milestone.
- He had a reputation for being a meticulous judge, particularly in criminal law, and was regarded as a symbolic figure of Arab participation at the highest level of Israel’s judiciary.

### Role in the Moshe Katsav case

- Moshe Katsav, former President of Israel (2000-2007), was convicted of rape, sexual harassment, indecent acts and obstruction of justice.
- The Supreme Court rejected Katsav’s appeal. One news report states: “Such a senior official should be a role model … Every woman has a right to her own body.” — words attributed to Judge Joubran in that decision.
- The ruling made clear that even the office of President is not above the law in Israel, and Joubran’s participation reinforced that principle.

---

### Legacy and impact

- Joubran’s appointment and career were hailed as steps toward diversity in the Israeli judiciary and for minority representation.
- At the same time, he didn’t shy away from critique: for example, he publicly described the “nation-state law” passed in Israel as “a very, very, very bad law” because of its implications for Arab citizens.
- His career shows a combination of high judicial responsibility and an awareness of minority rights and equality issues.
