Is that the heady scent of hubris, wafting through the winter air of Washington, D.C.? So bold has President Trump been in the first month of his second term that nervous Europeans wonder if the American republic is now unabashedly an empire. Trump renames seas. He reclaims canals. He demands Greenland. He trolls Canada. His proposal for peace in Gaza is wholesale resettlement of its population. His plan for peace in Ukraine begins to look a lot like partition.

In the ancient Hellenic world, hubris was the kind of pride or arrogance that led a mortal to defy the gods. But hard on its heels there usually came Nemesis, the goddess of divine retribution. The historian prefers to exclude deities from his narrative. He discerns the more prosaic operation of budgetary constraints. For it is these, not gods, that set limits on the geopolitical ambitions of republics and empires alike.

What I call Ferguson’s Law states that any great power that spends more on debt service than on defense risks ceasing to be a great power. The insight is not mine but originates with the Scottish political theorist Adam Ferguson, whose “Essay on the History of Civil Society” (1767) brilliantly identified the perils of excessive public debt.

Ferguson understood what modern economists call the “tax-smoothing” properties of public debt: By borrowing to pay for a war or some other emergency, a government can spread the cost over multiple generations of taxpayers. But he also saw the catch. “The growing burden,” he observed, is “gradually laid,” and though a nation may “sink in some future age, every minister hopes it may still keep afloat in his own.” For this reason, public debt is “extremely dangerous…in the hands of a precipitant and ambitious administration.”

His conclusion was prophetic: “An expense, whether sustained at home or abroad, whether a waste of the present, or an anticipation of future, revenue, if it bring no proper return, is to be reckoned among the causes of national ruin.”

Economists have long sought in vain a threshold that defines how much debt is too much. My own formulation of Adam Ferguson’s idea focuses our attention on the crucial historical relationship between debt service (interest plus the repayment of principal) and national security (expenditure on defense, including investment in research and development).

The crucial threshold is the point where debt service exceeds defense spending, after which the centripetal forces of the aggregate debt burden tend to pull apart the geopolitical grip of a great power, leaving it vulnerable to military challenge.

The striking thing is that, for the first time in nearly a century, the U.S. began violating Ferguson’s Law last year. Annual defense spending—to be precise, national defense consumption expenditures and gross investment—was $1.107 trillion in 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), while federal expenditure on interest payments (the government long ago gave up on paying down principal) topped out at $1.124 trillion.

These outlays can also be expressed as percentages of gross domestic product. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which uses a narrower definition of defense spending than the BEA, places it at 2.9% of GDP for last year. Net interest payments (adjusting for the interest received by bonds held by government agencies) amounted to 3.1%.

We have seen nothing like this since the era of isolationism. Between 1962 and 1989, U.S. defense spending averaged 6.4% of GDP; debt service was less than a third of that at 1.8%. Even after the end of the Cold War, the federal government was still spending, on average, roughly twice as much on national security as on interest on the debt.

The fact that the U.S. is currently projected to spend a rising share of its GDP on interest payments and a falling share on defense means that American power is much more fiscally constrained than most people realize. By 2049, according to the CBO’s latest long-term budget projection, net interest payments on the federal debt will have risen to 4.9% of GDP. If defense spending maintains its recent share of discretionary spending, it will amount to half that share of GDP.

Nor is there any real possibility that defense spending will increase dramatically. Because such spending is discretionary, it has to be appropriated by Congress every year, unlike spending on entitlement programs (which is mandatory) and interest payments (nonpayment of which would be default). If anything, budgetary constraints are likely to put downward pressure on defense spending in the decades ahead.
