“History never repeats itself, but the kaleidoscopic combinations of the pictured present often seem to be constructed out of the broken fragments of antique legends.” The quotation, [often given wrongly](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/01/12/history-rhymes/?amp=1) as “History never repeats itself, but it rhymes,” comes from chapter 47 of *[The Gilded Age](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781539945147)* by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner. Published in 1873, this seldom-read novel gave its name to an epoch of American history. The current popularity of [HBO’s television series](https://www.hbomax.com/shows/gilded-age/2537da31-ff99-4195-a53e-e0e1ddb1d67e) of the same title prompts the question: Are we living in a new Gilded Age?

As columnist [Peggy Noonan](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/why-the-gilded-age-resonates-in-2025-c5c6aa20) noted last week in *The Wall Street Journal*, HBO’s series has struck a chord. It is not just that it captures “the clang, clash, and fire of industrial America being born and high society being invented.” It’s that it offers a vision of an American elite apparently free of our modern neuroses.

Rather than “the freakish glamour of the Met Gala,” Noonan observed, the show’s creator, Julian Fellowes, gives viewers a costume parade that is “secure in the values it asserts, confident in its definitions.” The talented cast—Christine Baranski as the snobbish Agnes van Rhijn, Carrie Coon as the scheming Bertha Russell—make the best of scripts that sometimes sound like episodes of *Downton Abbey* translated into American English by ChatGPT.

What Noonan overlooked, though, was that *The Gilded Age* also serves as a mirror in which we can recognize many aspects of our own time. That is of course Fellowes’ intention, which is why the series is riddled with anachronisms—especially in its treatment of racial issues. I would love to believe in the friendship between the white central character, Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson) and the black would-be writer Peggy Scott (Denée Benton), but it’s a heavy lift.

Which is why, if you’re really interested in what happens to a society as it goes through a wild economic transformation comparable with ours today, it’s more illuminating to read Twain and Warner than to watch HBO’s period drama.

Central to the plot of the novel is speculation in real estate. Si Hawkins, head of a dirt-poor family in the American South, dreams that industrialization will make the 75,000 acres of undeveloped land in East Tennessee he owns worth a thousand dollars an acre. “Steamboats,” he assures his wife, “are going to make a revolution in this world’s affairs that will make men dizzy to contemplate.” In search of any opportunity other than gainful employment, Hawkins and his family sail up the Mississippi to Missouri to join the irrepressibly entrepreneurial and regularly bankrupt “Colonel” Beriah Sellers, an American [Micawber](https://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/Micawber).

Hawkins and Sellers are not wrong that steamships, railroads, and coal mines will transform places like East Tennessee in the years to come. They are just wrong in their timing, as the prosperity of the Industrial Age took several decades to spread across the continent. It was especially slow to reach former Confederate states such as Tennessee.

So the Hawkins family is forced to look elsewhere for their fortune.

Impressed by a visit from Senator Abner Dilworthy, two of Si’s children—his adopted daughter, the beautiful Laura, and her older brother Washington—travel to the capital city of the same name in the belief that they can salvage the family’s fortunes through politics. With Dilworthy’s help, Laura enters Washington society and becomes a skilled coquette and political operator. She and Dilworthy devise a bill to sell the Tennessee land to the government for the foundation of a university for emancipated slaves (“the Knobs Industrial University... open to all persons without distinction of sex, color, or religion”).

It’s become a cliché to point out that, in our time, inequality, measured by wealth and income, has come close to matching that of the Gilded Age. This is in fact untrue, unless one ignores the redistributive effects of taxes and transfers that certainly did not exist in the late 19th century.

Twain’s portrayal of Washington, D.C., at the height of its postbellum venality resonates. Modern readers will also appreciate Twain’s ironic explanation of the way the machine politics of the era worked.

Best of all is the novel’s sensational climax. Laura murders her former husband—a bigamous Confederate officer—but is found not guilty of the crime on the grounds of temporary insanity. Dilworthy is found guilty of buying votes, so the Knobs University bill is thrown out, dashing the Hawkins family’s hopes. Washington Hawkins finally gives up ownership of the still-unimproved land parcel when he cannot afford to pay $180 in taxes.

In short, Twain and Warner’s *Gilded Age* is a very modern tale of get-rich-quick scams on the frontier and nefarious goings-on in the swamp. If it were rewritten today, Washington and Laura Hawkins would be at the [Executive Branch](https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-family-monetized-maga) club, pitching a Gildedbuck meme coin and coal-powered data centers for DrillAI.

It’s become a cliché to point out that, in our time, inequality, measured by wealth and income, has come close to matching that of the Gilded Age. This is in fact untrue, unless one ignores the redistributive effects of taxes and transfers that certainly did not exist in the late 19th century.

What is true is that, compared with the period from the Great Depression of the 1930s until the [Great Inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/1970s-great-inflation.asp) of the 1970s, wealth and income are more unequally distributed today—though even this should not be overstated. The [best estimates](https://davidsplinter.com/AutenSplinter-Tax_Data_and_Inequality.pdf) of the share of after-tax income of the top 1 percent of earners suggest that it was about the same in 2019 (8.8 percent) as it was in 1988. If this is a Gilded Age, it has been going strong for nearly 40 years.

Still, ultrahigh net worth individuals and their families are certainly able to match the conspicuous consumption of their Gilded Age predecessors and with a great deal more comfort and convenience, not to mention much better health.

I recently attended a Gilded Age–themed lunch in a palatial private residence, at which the guest of honor was one of the stars of the television series. To round off a sumptuous buffet, Baked Alaska was served—a dish [said to have been invented](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/29/469957638/baked-alaska-a-creation-story-shrouded-in-mystery) at Delmonico’s in New York to mark the acquisition of Alaska by the United States in 1867. The palace was notable for its owner’s magnificent collection of *ancien régime* art and furnishings, though the principal topic of conversation was the court of King Donald, not King Louis.

Jeff Bezos’s [Venetian wedding](https://pagesix.com/2025/06/27/celebrity-news/jeff-bezos-marries-lauren-sanchez-in-over-the-top-wedding/) in June was another illustration of the point. As in the *fin de siècle* era, American plutocrats crave Europe’s architecture and art—if only as backdrops for their parties.

Another obvious parallel is the way large-scale migration to the United States has depressed wages at the lower end of the income scale, while boosting corporate profitability. In the Gilded Age, nativists fretted about the huge influx of Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants from Europe’s impoverished periphery. In 1882, Congress [passed an act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/chinese-exclusion-act) essentially ending migration from China.

Strikingly, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population is now higher than it was at its previous peak in the 1890s. Last year it was [15.6 percent](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-foreign-born-share-of-the-u-s-population-1850-2024/); back in 1890 it was 14.8 percent.

Now as then, the rest of the world marvels at American economic exceptionalism. Economic growth in the last two decades has been significantly more impressive here than in other developed countries, including Germany and Japan, once seen as challengers.

Now as then, U.S. growth is driven partly by a technological leap forward that involves eye-popping capital expenditure. In the late 19th century, it was railroads, heavy industry, and electrification. Today, comparable (although not quite as high) shares of GDP are being [invested in data centers](https://paulkedrosky.com/honey-ai-capex-ate-the-economy/) to satisfy the immense appetite of artificial intelligence models for electricity.

In our time, U.S. politics is in many ways reverting to late 19th-century patterns. The key policy issues of the Gilded Age were: [tariffs](https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-McKinley-Tariff-of-1890/), immigration restriction, monetary policy ([gold vs. bimetallism](https://www.herobullion.com/free-silver-movement-history/)), trusts, and monopolies. Those issues have returned to the fore since Donald Trump’s emergence as a national political figure 10 years ago. It was revealing that last year [Trump cited William McKinley](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-trump-interview-transcript/?sref=ojq9DljU) —who [served as president](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/bios/william-mckinley) from 1897 until 1901—as a role model.

At the same time, we have seen a resurgence of machine politics at the state and local level. Far more than was true in the mid-20th century, when voters often [split their votes](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/the-postwar-history-of-senate-presidential-ticket-splitting-part-one/) between parties and landslides [were quite regular](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/landslide-elections-and-policy-mandates/), today, as in the late 19th century, most counties in most states are [either red or blue](https://theconversation.com/americas-counties-are-less-purple-than-they-used-to-be-243543).

Political corruption thrived in the Gilded Age as it does today, in the sense that tariff (or export control) regimes always encourage special interests to seek privileged treatment through access to trade policymakers. Nothing illustrates this better than the way the chief executives of major corporations have been able to exert influence over trade policy to the benefit of their companies. A prime example is the recent deal Trump struck with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whereby the U.S. Commerce Department [eased restrictions](https://www.ft.com/content/e9c52f00-9bde-4840-801e-ba66c792df9e?shareType=nongift) on the exports of Nvidia’s H20 microchips to China after Huang agreed to pay [a share of the proceeds](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-trade-tariffs-475b5cd7) to the Treasury.

During the Gilded Age, the New York Democratic political machine siphoned off vast sums from the city and state budgets. Today, California has a budget of [$298 billion](https://www.cccco.edu/-/media/CCCCO-Website/docs/report/2024-joint-analysis-enacted-budget-a11y.pdf) but a deficit of [$47 billion](https://ebudget.ca.gov/2024-25/pdf/Enacted/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf) in large part because the state’s vast wealth—much of it created in Silicon Valley—is siphoned off by a similar Democratic political machine, the Tammany Hall of the teachers unions.

The major reactions to Gilded Age politics were agrarian populism (through the [Populist Party](https://digital.lib.niu.edu/illinois/gildedage/populism)) and municipal progressivism—movements that benefited from the role of muckraking journalists in exposing corruption. Also characteristic of the Gilded Age was a trend toward political extremism and political violence. McKinley was himself [assassinated by](https://millercenter.org/president/mckinley/death-of-the-president) Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. We have our own versions of these political reactions today. The MAGA movement embodies a significant number of populist leitmotifs. The progressive or “woke” left can be considered the equivalents of the more radical progressives and socialists of the past. And in [Luigi Mangione](https://www.thefp.com/p/inside-the-cult-of-luigi-mangione), we have a Leon Czolgosz for our times.

At the same time, the late 1890s saw a surge of geopolitical self-confidence in the United States, illustrated by the territorial acquisitions that followed the Spanish-American War and President Theodore Roosevelt’s peacemaking between Russia and Japan in 1905. Trump has supplied his own version of this assertiveness with his threats to make Canada the 51st state, to acquire Greenland, and to reclaim U.S. ownership of the Panama Canal, as well as his hunger to win the Nobel Peace Prize, as Roosevelt did in 1906.

But there the resemblances to the Gilded Age end. It hardly needs stating that the rights of women and racial minorities were drastically curtailed in the 1890s by the standards of the 2020s. It is also true that social norms are far looser today than they were then. We tolerate all kinds of perverse behavior and [petty crime](https://www.thefp.com/p/michael-shellenberger-californians-get-serious-crime-homelessness). Future historians will struggle to make sense of the excesses of the [transgender mania](https://www.thefp.com/p/abigail-shrier-how-the-gender-fever-broke-trump-executive-order), which culminated in the mutilation of thousands of American children.

The original Gilded Age had “brute but recognizable rules,” in Noonan’s words. “Make a whole pot of money, be generous with it to gain notice but enact modesty when thanked, learn to imitate personal dignity and a little refinement, and you’re in.... Now it’s more just the money, no one has to bow to some phony old value system, and the money spurts in all directions, creating a themeless chaos, and tech billionaires in sweatshirts give us moral lectures from Jeffrey Epstein’s plane.”

Behind such degeneration in elite behavior lies the recent decline of religious belief and observance.

Other differences suggest themselves. The country is much more urban than it was then. Because of falling fertility and lengthening lifespans, ours is a much more elderly society, whereas theirs was youthful. In 1890, 56 percent of the U.S. population was under 25. Today that share is 31 percent. The share of those 65 and older has more than quadrupled from 3.9 percent to 17 percent.

The networked age has also created an entirely new social order that is globally interconnected as never before. More importantly, the network structure of our era is different. The Gilded Age was an era of hub-and-spoke connections, typified by the railroads. The global economy today is a far more complex and shape-shifting system, in some respects more distributed, in others more centralized.

As in the *fin de siècle* era, American plutocrats crave Europe’s architecture and art—if only as backdrops for their parties.

Our political order is also radically different. The federal government of the Gilded Age was trivially small. As recently as 1929, federal net outlays were [less than](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYONGDA188S) 3 percent of GDP, compared with 23 percent [last year](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/#:~:text=The%20federal%20government%20spent%20$6.75,the%20United%20States%20that%20year.). There was scarcely any federal debt—less than 20 percent of GDP in the 1880s, [falling below](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/11/the-long-story-of-us-debt-from-1790-to-2011-in-1-little-chart/265185/) 10 percent from 1889 until 1917.

In our time, power over policy has shifted away from Congress to the “administrative state” and the White House—a shift exemplified by [Trump’s assertion](https://www.cfr.org/report/tariffs-trading-partners-can-president-actually-do) that he has the right to determine tariffs without reference to the legislature, a remarkable violation of the Constitution. (It remains to be seen if the Supreme Court [will uphold](https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-judges-got-it-wrong-trumps-tariffs) the president’s use of the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45618) as the basis for his reciprocal tariffs.) Other examples include the Trump administration’s claims that it has the right to impound funds appropriated by Congress; to extend the deadline for an authorized TikTok sale against the express will of the legislature; and to end birthright citizenship.

Above all, the geopolitical situation of the country has altered beyond all recognition. The United States is no longer a rising power, as it was in the decades after Twain’s *Gilded Age*. It has been the incumbent superpower for 80 years. By contrast, China in the Gilded Age was miserably poor and susceptible to foreign interference. No longer. Now it is America’s economic and technological equal, with a chip on its shoulder about a “century of humiliation.” Today, it is Americans who are addicted, often lethally, to opioids—a national epidemic that played a vital role in mobilizing middle America behind Trump.

The ghastly possibility cannot be ruled out that today is truly the Gilded Age of Xi Jinping’s China—for what other country today is more “secure in the values it asserts, confident in its definitions,” and what other region has undergone as rapid an industrial and technological transformation [as China](https://www.cato.org/publications/chinas-post-1978-economic-development-entry-global-trading-system#) after Mao’s death? Not the United States, and certainly not Europe. An alternative view is that the United States today is in some respects more like Qing (or perhaps Ottoman) America, a fiscally overstretched system run by a decadent emperor and an ossified bureaucracy, the vulnerabilities of which cannot be cured by attempts at reform, and await only a war (or civil war) to be calamitously exposed.

It is certainly too early to say that the Trump administration will succeed in its efforts to reduce the power of the “deep state.” DOGE is [not quite dead](https://www.wired.com/story/sweetrex-deregulation-ai-us-government-regulation-doge/), but Elon Musk’s postelection dream that he could bring [Javier Milei](https://www.thefp.com/p/niall-ferguson-talks-to-javier-milei) ’s chain saw to Washington proved to be a delusion. Much therefore depends on how much China’s leaders are willing to risk in challenging American primacy in the Indo-Pacific region at a time when the reforms of Trump 2.0 are still a work in progress.

It is the elite of the Chinese Communist Party who, in the past 20 years, have enabled their country to overtake the United States as a manufacturing superpower. They are the ones who have been arming China to the teeth in every domain, including space. Like that of Gilded Age America, China’s economic rise has been based partly on real estate development. And the financial problems that have come in the wake of a property bubble faintly echo those of the 1870s and 1890s, even if China’s state-run banking system would never allow the kind of financial crisis that struck the United States in 1873 and 1893.

Also familiar to the economic historian is the cutthroat competition that characterizes China’s most dynamic manufacturing sectors. What we cannot easily tell is whether these economic pains increase or reduce Xi Jinping’s willingness to gamble on confrontation with the United States.

So yes, ours is in some respects a Gilded Age. A period of remarkable economic dynamism, the late 19th century in the United States was characterized by great inequality, mass mobility, unprecedented investment and innovation, crooked politics, ideological polarization, and imperial aspiration. We see similar trends today. Yet the United States today is an aging empire, not a rising power. Its social fabric is torn. Its faiths are weak. Urban, elderly, distracted by a febrile “news” cycle, and addicted to a vile diet of processed foods and pharmaceuticals, American society is decadent by the standards of our great-grandparents. A vast and growing public debt is only the most obvious expression of the incoherent and incontinent desires of the electorate and the feebleness of the legislature. The constitutional order may well be decaying.

Our adversaries observe all this and wonder if the project to Make America Great Again will one day be filed alongside the reforms of the Qing or Ottoman empires as another case of a moribund system seeking to save itself with homeopathic remedies. Twain’s “kaleidoscopic combinations of the pictured present” are indeed“constructed out of the broken fragments of antique legends.” The challenge is to know which antique legend our era most closely resembles.

Is it a Gilded Age? Or, like some Oriental eunuch, a Gelded one?
