In 2000, columnist Patrick J. Buchanan defeated Donald Trump for the Reform Party nomination. But it was the property developer and television star who, more than a decade later, brought Buchanan’s populist views on trade, immigration, and nonintervention into the White House. “The ideas made it, but I didn’t,” [Buchanan told](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/22/pat-buchanan-trump-president-history-profile-215042/) journalist Tim Alberta in 2017. Such are the wages of political prophecy.

If Buchanan prefigured President Trump’s first-term nationalism, another thinker anticipated Trump’s second-term war against the administrative state and sweeping revision of American foreign policy: international relations professor Angelo Codevilla.

Codevilla [died in 2021](https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/2021/09/23/rip-angelo-codevilla-1943-2021/), but his ideas endure. His core insight, developed in a 2010 essay and in subsequent books and publications, was that a progressive ruling class based on a sense of social superiority had captured government and academia and large parts of the business sector and waged war against ordinary Americans to maintain and expand its power. The result, Codevilla said, was an increasingly oppressive centralized bureaucracy immune to supervision, and an American empire that failed to keep Americans safe.

Today’s political vocabulary—“ruling class,” “administrative state,” “Deep State,” “cold civil war,” “uniparty”—comes from Codevilla’s pen. One sees Codevilla’s influence everywhere, from Trump’s reversal of DEI and affirmative action to DOGE’s [unspooling of USAID](https://www.thefp.com/p/defending-usaid-is-political-suicide) to reductions in the federal workforce to the foreign-policy pivot [toward our own hemisphere](https://www.thefp.com/p/memo-to-trump-america-first-china-russia-iran?r=3awiq&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web). Friends and participants in his seminars, such as Office of Management and Budget director [Russell Vought](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/russell-vought-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-trump-rcna191356), State Department director of policy planning [Michael Anton](https://www.state.gov/about-us-policy-planning-staff/), and State Department counselor [Michael Needham](https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/trump-picks-deputy-secretary-of-state-state-dept-counselor), serve in the administration. They are busy enacting his critique of America, with unpredictable consequences.

Codevilla was 12 years old when he arrived from Italy in 1955. He served in the Navy and Foreign Service and studied politics at Claremont Graduate University with philosophers [Leo Strauss](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/the-legacy-of-leo-strauss-after-50-years/) and [Harry V. Jaffa](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/author/harry-v-jaffa/). Strauss, a German Jew who’d fled Nazism, was the author of dense, classic studies of political thought, such as *[Natural Right and History](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780226776941)*, where he argued that the modern world had taken a wrong turn long ago when it abandoned a belief in objective standards of value for relativistic empiricism. Strauss’s most famous student, Allan Bloom of the University of Chicago, applied these theories to American universities in his 1987 bestseller, *[The Closing of the American Mind](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781451683202)*. For his part, Jaffa used Strauss’s method of close reading to analyze Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and other American statesmen, most famously in *[Crisis of the House Divided](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780226391182)*, published in 1959.

After receiving his doctorate, Codevilla came to Washington, D.C. He taught at Georgetown, joined the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and worked on Ronald Reagan’s presidential transition. Academic posts followed at Boston University and Stanford’s Hoover Institution.

Yet it was the Claremont Institute that made Codevilla famous. Founded by Jaffa’s students in 1979, for much of its history the institute was a small think tank devoted to the American Founding and to [Abraham Lincoln](https://www.claremont.org/fellowships/lincoln-fellowship/#:~:text=As%20its%20name%20implies%2C%20the,rights%20of%20all%20human%20beings.). The attacks of September 11, 2001, transformed it. Through fellowships for students and young professionals, and in the pages of its flagship *Claremont Review of Books*, Codevilla and other Claremont scholars became the conservative movement’s internal critics.

They skewered George W. Bush’s and John Boehner’s Republican Party for trading the Founders’ wisdom for establishment credentials. Bush, in this view, had created new entitlements, increased spending, and launched America on a foolish quest to bring democracy to the Middle East. And House Speaker Boehner was the classic get-along-to-go-along Republican, shying away from clashing with Barack Obama over taxes and debt.

The global financial crisis of 2008 bolstered the Claremont analysis. The bank rescue plan exposed the gulf between elites in Washington and conservatives outside the Beltway. For Claremont’s constitutionalists, the antiestablishment Tea Party was a possible tonic for Obama’s overdose of big-government progressivism.

What made the Tea Party significant was its opposition to both parties. Republicans who voted for bailouts, and to fund the Affordable Care Act, were complicit in Obama’s assault on the American experiment. The Tea Party, Codevilla wrote, offered a full-spectrum populism devoted to restoring a lost sense of limited government to both the GOP and Washington, D.C.

An electric and lengthy Codevilla essay from 2010 remains the best expression of populist attitudes toward parties and government in contemporary America. “Republican and Democratic office holders and their retinues show a similar presumption to dominate and fewer differences in tastes, habits, opinions, and sources of income among one another than between both and the rest of the country,” [he wrote](https://spectator.org/americas-ruling-class/) in *The American Spectator*. “They think, look, and act as a class.”

Not just any class. Once they entered politics, Codevilla went on, Republicans and Democrats joined America’s “ruling class” through shared educational attainment, lingo, professional associations, and financial relationships. Above all, the ruling class is “oriented to government.” It lives off bureaucracy. It’s invested in the status quo.

Codevilla’s vision of an apocalyptic conflict between the noble, working-class majority and cosseted, highly educated elites captured the spirit of the moment. Rush Limbaugh read the piece on his radio program. A paperback edition soon followed. Suddenly Codevilla was a conservative celebrity.

And he had more to say. American foreign policy, Codevilla long argued, had gone astray with Woodrow Wilson. American elites looked abroad not to secure American interests but to impose world order. Their quest, Codevilla argued, hadn’t produced order, peace, or victory. It had given us one intervention after another and needless casualties. Codevilla supported another tradition, exemplified by George Washington and John Quincy Adams. Avoid meddling in other countries. If war comes, do what it takes to win.

Here too, Codevilla was in the vanguard. Tea Party senators Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Ted Cruz represented a new generation of Republicans during the Obama years who opposed non-retaliatory military intervention and nation building and criticized drone and surveillance policies. In 2013, when Paul led [a 13-hour talking filibuster](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/rand-paul-filibuster-john-brennan-cia-nominee-088507) against the potential threat of domestic drone strikes against terrorists on U.S. soil, most Republicans treated him as a fringe figure. Now his ideas are at the heart of the effort to tame the [bipartisan foreign policy “Blob”](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/trump-foreign-policy-elites-insiders-experts-international-relations-214846/) that advocates American global leadership.

Conservative views of intelligence and security agencies changed, too. The right used to treat the CIA and FBI as means to secure victory over communism and terrorism. Now, under Obama, they looked more like tools of domestic repression. Conservatives had once reliably defended such institutions. But with the revelation that [FISA courts](https://bja.ojp.gov/program/it/privacy-civil-liberties/authorities/statutes/1286) [had authorized surveillance](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/trumps-wiretapping-accusations-heres-what-government) of Trump’s campaign, these same conservatives increasingly saw the state itself as a partisan actor devoted to quashing the right.

By 2016, Codevilla had concluded the situation may be beyond repair. Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” jibe perfectly expressed ruling-class disdain. America had entered a revolutionary period whose outcome was unknown. The Founders’ republic was gone. It had been replaced by an American empire whose future was hazy. Codevilla wasn’t sure Trump would succeed. “Speculating about Trump’s mind is futile,” [he wrote](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/after-the-republic/). But he did think Trump’s candidacy was a vehicle for opponents of the ruling class.

Reaction to Trump’s first term was visceral. The ruling class and traditional America were locked, [Codevilla wrote](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/the-cold-civil-war/), in a “cold civil war.” His prescription—decentralization, federalism, and global retrenchment—went unheeded. And the revolution spiraled out of control. “Unattainable, and gone forever, is the whole American Republic that had existed for some 200 years after 1776,” [Codevilla announced in 2018](https://americanmind.org/salvo/our-revolutions-logic/). True federalism remained the answer. To counteract the Deep State, the FISA court would have to be abolished, the FBI remade, and the CIA [torn apart](https://americanmind.org/memo/abolish-the-cia/).

Codevilla’s basic framework—ruling class versus the anti-establishment country class—stayed in place throughout the Covid pandemic, George Floyd riots, and 2020 election. Joe Biden’s presidency, Codevilla argued, demanded singular leadership to [rescue America](https://americanmind.org/salvo/to-rescue-a-nation/). Yet he remained uncertain about Trump. No one seemed to him able to stop the progressive revolution behind America’s decline.

“Perhaps the only useful result of the Afghan enterprise’s clamorous collapse, at a time when so much else that our ruling class is doing also collapses of its own weight, is the widespread recognition that we are not seeing the results of discrete choices about foreign policy,” [Codevilla wrote](https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=13732) in one of his last articles, published after America’s deadly retreat from Afghanistan in August 2021. “We are experiencing the inexorable working out of the logic by which a whole class lives, moves, and has its being.”

Codevilla died in a car accident the following month. He was 78 years old. He didn’t live to see his vindication—but vindicated he has been. Trump officials are cracking down on illegal immigration. They are downsizing the government. They are shaking up intel. They are scaling back foreign commitments. And they are promoting missile defense.

No one who met Codevilla ever forgot him. Tall and lanky, with a broad forehead, deep-set eyes, and raspy voice, he loved company and conversation. And he delighted in provocation. His direct manner and strong opinions made him enemies. His vast learning and wry smile won him just as many friends.

I speak from experience. I contributed to the *Claremont Review of Books* from 2010 to 2019 and spent a week as a Claremont Institute [Lincoln fellow](https://www.claremont.org/lincoln-fellowship-alumni/) in the summer of 2011. Codevilla began one of our classes by asking, “Who here has read Robert Kagan’s *Dangerous Nation*?”

I raised my hand.

Codevilla stared at me, eyes blazing.

“That book,” he thundered, “is a piece of trash!”

That was Angelo Codevilla: passionate, sweeping, patriotic, and utterly convinced. He would have savored this moment. The ruling class faces its reckoning. And the prophet’s time has arrived.
