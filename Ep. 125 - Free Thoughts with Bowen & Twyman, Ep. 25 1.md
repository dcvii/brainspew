### Summary  
The conversation between Michael David Cobb Bowen and Wakefield F. Twyman Jr. delves deeply into the complexities of Black American identity, culture, class, and public perception. They explore how race and class intersect and diverge within the Black community, noting that experiences and perspectives vary widely across different social strata. They challenge the monolithic portrayal of Black America, emphasizing the variety of Black subcultures, from the "hill" (black old money) to the "hood" and the "ghetto," highlighting how class significantly shapes identity and worldview.

The dialogue touches on historical influences, such as the Great Migration, W.E.B. Du Bois‚Äô concept of the Talented Tenth, and E. Franklin Frazier‚Äôs sociological insights, explaining how cultural norms and racial perceptions evolved over time. They critique how mass media, especially since the rise of mass communications, has limited Black Americans' control over their public image, often painting Black culture through a narrow, stereotypical lens. The conversation also addresses countercultural and ghetto influences, particularly their manifestation in hip hop and rap music, and considers how this mainstreaming impacts society‚Äôs understanding of Blackness.

They discuss Black nationalism's role in fostering unity but also its tensions with traditional Black families and their values. Additionally, the speakers analyze the social conservatism within the Black upper class and the challenges of navigating between Black cultural authenticity and aspirations for broader societal acceptance.

Ultimately, their discourse promotes recognizing the multiplicity of Black experiences and warns against racial essentialism, advocating for a nuanced understanding of identity that values individual stories and the reality of Black America's class distinctions. Self-love and self-respect for younger generations emerge as key solutions to combating the negative impacts of societal pathology and racial narratives.

### Highlights  
- üî• The discussion unveils the varied social classes within Black America, from "the hill" to the "ghetto" and "projects."  
- üé§ Black culture and identity have been shaped by external observers historically, affecting public perception and self-presentation.  
- üñ§ The Talented Tenth concept and black nationalism both shaped leadership ideas but also created cultural tensions.  
- üé∂ Hip hop and rap music reflect and perpetuate aspects of ghetto culture, impacting broader society and individual identity.  
- üìö Race essentialism limits understanding of Black experiences and overlooks significant class differences.  
- üèÜ Media portrayal and celebrity culture affect societal views of Black America, with figures like Denzel Washington altering mainstream perceptions.  
- üí° Self-love and raising children with strong self-respect are key to overcoming cultural and societal challenges in Black communities.  

### Key Insights  
- üìä **Complex Stratification within Black America:** The discussion highlights that Black America is not a monolith but comprises at least six distinct class-based segments: the hill (old money), the burbs, the hood, the ghetto, the projects, and the sticks. Each group has unique social realities and cultural norms that deeply influence identity and community life. This insight challenges simplistic racial narratives and emphasizes socio-economic diversity.  
- üèõÔ∏è **Historical Construction of Public Image:** Black leaders and intellectuals from the North, such as W.E.B. Du Bois, played a crucial role in documenting Black life from a sometimes outsider perspective, inadvertently influencing the "ghetto" stereotype. The media and mass communication further complicated Black cultural control by popularizing narrow representations, such as those seen in blaxploitation films or gangsta rap. This underscores how public narratives are often shaped by external framing rather than community self-definition.  
- ‚úä **Tensions Between Black Nationalism and Traditional Conservatism:** Black nationalism promoted racial unity and cultural pride, rejecting slave names and embracing African heritage. However, it also conflicted with Black old money traditions and family-oriented conservatism, creating fractures within the community. The speakers illuminate the push-pull between radical identity politics and longstanding social institutions, showing how both have shaped Black cultural expression.  
- üéµ **Impact of Hip Hop and Rap Culture:** Hip hop, particularly its gangsta rap subset, both reflects and fuels the "ghetto" ethos, normalizing rebellion, oppositional defiance, and explicit content. While some artists elevate social consciousness (e.g., Public Enemy), commercialization has often co-opted these messages, influencing youth culture and societal perceptions with problematic stereotypes. This illustrates the complexity of cultural products as both art and social forces.  
- üé≠ **Class over Race in Social Perception:** The dialogue suggests that class and social status often play a more critical role than race in American society and within Black communities themselves. The divergence between black elites and the masses‚Äîsocially, economically, and culturally‚Äîcomplicates notions of racial solidarity and shows how internal class dynamics affect opportunities and self-identification. The success and reception of media portrayals (e.g., The Cosby Show) hinge on class images rather than race alone.  
- üß† **Psychological and Sociological Barriers to Overcoming Racial Essentialism:** The conversation exposes how racial essentialism‚Äîassigning fixed characteristics based on race‚Äîremains a persistent obstacle, bolstered by social institutions and cultural fatigue within Black communities. The speakers argue for embracing the diversity of Black experiences and moving beyond imposed racial identities to foster healthier self-perceptions and interpersonal understanding.  
- üí° **The Power of Self-Respect and Family Values:** Ultimately, the speakers stress that empowering young Black individuals with self-love and respect is vital to counteracting destructive cycles perpetuated by negative cultural influences and systemic challenges. Family traditions, manners, and nurturing environments provide resilience against societal pressures and open pathways to success beyond limiting racial narratives. This insight connects personal agency to broader cultural transformation.  

The conversation, rich in historical context and sociological detail, offers a nuanced and introspective exploration of the challenges and possibilities within Black American life, urging listeners to appreciate complexity over stereotype.

Good morning or evening, friends. This is your friendly announcer, Michael David Cobb Bowen, here with my friend and colleague, Wakefield F. Twyman Jr. How you doing, Wink? Doing well, doing well. Always a pleasure. Greetings from a sunny Sunday morning in San Diego. Oh, it's super hot here in LA. It's been 88 degrees.

0:27

My air conditioner turns on at 7 o'clock in the morning. It's like Phoenix.

0:31

That's crazy. Nuts. Yeah. I mean, you know, yesterday was my birthday, and we plan to go to the Colorado Court, which is out by Memorial.

0:40

And I just thought, it's too hot. It is too hot. So we just avoided that altogether and just came home and I just laid out on the couch. As opposed to, you know, sweating out by the ocean. But, yeah, yeah, it's that time of season.

0:54

I mean, for us, the hottest part of the year tends to be late August and September.

0:59

Yep, yep. This is Indian summer coming up on fire season. Because soon we'll have the Santa Ana winds. That's right. And they'll blow off the desert, a bunch of hot air. And we'll see. Hopefully the good people in L.A. have learned some lessons from last time. No, we haven't. No. We haven't learned anything. We've had fires.

1:24

We've had riots. We've had ice raids. Man, it's crazy. You know, I think, you know, a little bit of stress brings out the ghetto in a lot of people.

1:38

There's that word, ghetto.

1:39

Yeah, it is. You know what? Let's put on some Rick James. Bust out of L7 Square and talk about the ghetto. One thing about the ghetto, you don't have to hurry. It'll be there tomorrow. Brother, don't you worry. Ghetto life. So, I mean,

2:00

I want to do one qualification because Wink and I do a little banter before we get started. Okay. And I've invented a word and you already know what the meaning of it is. It's blacksplaining. It's when you listen to black folks get up and start pontificating. And in the end, they have a prescription.

2:22

They have a call to action. You got to do this for black people or black people need to do this. And we don't do any of that. That's why this podcast is called Free Thoughts. We're just telling you what we see, the way we see it, take it or leave it. And I think we,

2:39

without having a very particulate pro-black or anti-black or pro-white agenda, we just let you know how we think about stuff. And we give you an opportunity to get inside our heads while we air our dirty laundry about black society. Yeah. You know, I think that's so important, Michael. I mean,

3:02

one of my pet peeves among many in race literature and discourse, you'll always have, I once wrote an essay on a subset called The Pattern, and there's certain elements you can perceive in the pattern when someone writes something or says something. One thing is someone will say, as a black man or as a black woman,

3:22

and that always grates on me because, no, you're not speaking for 20 million people. You're speaking for yourself. This is your perspective. And it annoys me that people don't push back on that. I have yet to hear on a podcast or public lecture where someone said that and someone pushed back. I don't know why that is,

3:45

other than people are reluctant to question the authority of anyone just because they're speaking from their skin color. They're speaking from their race. I think you're absolutely right. We want to talk about a couple naughty things.

4:05

K-N-O-T-T-Y.

4:10

that are complex. And I hope that's what we do all the time, that we can give a little bit of enlightenment or at least our insight as we go back and forth. Because if we had three people here, we'd be here all morning.

4:25

So it's good that Wink and I have certain things in common and certain things differently. Him growing up in the South, in the almost rural but suburbs, and me growing up in, The place that they now call The Hood. Oh, okay. But it's interesting because they changed it. Because after white flight, which would have been, you know,

4:55

65, whatever things started getting violent. After the Detroit riots, you know, white folks said, hey, I'm getting out of here. I used to live in an integrated neighborhood. I'm going to find a new neighborhood.

5:09

Right.

5:10

And so that became... a black neighborhood, even though it was mostly a black neighborhood. I'm talking about my place where I grew up. It's mostly a black neighborhood, but it certainly wasn't a ghetto. We had four, we had four apartment buildings and they were just four units each. It wasn't, it wasn't, and everybody else is a homeowner.

5:31

So there's, I don't know, 16 houses on the block. And you're discussing Los Angeles, correct? I'm discussing Los Angeles. Thank you. Uh, West Adams is the community, AKA Crenshaw. Uh, AKA South LA. Right. But then they said, well, it's not the ghetto. Let's call it the inner city.

5:49

Okay.

5:50

That was the politically correct thing. Yeah.

5:53

Yeah.

5:53

In the days. And then, as I said, this guy, author Davis wrote city of courts and coined the term South central. And then suddenly we all became South central. And then certain filmmakers took that meme and it was, you know, Sweet Sweetback's badass song shouldn't have been made because then everybody

6:17

wanted to do pimp movies and blaxploitation movies. And so here's what I'm... One of the premises that as we talk about ghetto life and all sorts of life is black folks specifically and people who are not geniuses in general, since the age of mass communications, have not been in control of their public image. You know what,

6:45

I think that's true, but for the sake of our conversation, I'm going to push back. Okay. So I'm going to say to you, Michael, but Michael, I grew up in the 1970s, the late 1960s, in a southern suburb. I always lived in all-black neighborhoods, and I always felt that the public image was controlled by Black Enterprise magazine.

7:11

by Ebony, by Jet, by Motown, by Tony Brown's Black Journal. So I would argue that, no, the image when I was growing up was always controlled by Black forces, Black interest. What do you say to that? That's interesting. I think things changed, definitely, and over the course of time in the post-Soul generation.

7:35

I mean, it used to be all... Aretha Franklin, and who was the godfather of soul, James Brown. Right. And then... oh god why am i blanking i'm seeing the album cover everybody says it's the greatest album of all time mercy mercy me oh yes marvin gay marvin gay there we go

7:57

marvin gay and so the minister yeah and all the old soul music was one generation we were all vibing on that same thing parents and children and i did consider that

8:09

vibe to be ghetto, quote unquote, however you define ghetto.

8:12

No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. But in the minds of certain Americans, black people are ghetto.

8:20

When did that occur? When did that occur? When did that happen, that public perception? I'm very curious.

8:26

I think it happened, you know, all the way back to, look at the major black-splainers of the 20th century. The three main people? Right. That would be Dubois, you know, and Booker T. Washington. Okay. And Carter G. Woodson. Okay. Oh, so you think that Du Bois played into that ghetto mentality or mindset when he

8:51

wrote the famous study of the Philadelphia Negro in 1899.

8:57

And I think also the souls of black folk. Yes, 1903. Kind of said, this is what black people are all about. I like that. That's very deep. That's very deep. And of course, the problem is, and I told someone this, a commentator recently,

9:13

boys was coming in a sense from the outside looking in right because he grew up in great barrington massachusetts born 1869 i think in an all-white town an all-white community and his family may have been one of the few blocks if not the only black family there so in some ways and i recently wrote a

9:34

essay called living uh in a world ghetto life i kind of adopted the same stance as wb du bois did in the souls of black folk meaning he was an outsider from an all-white new england town who came south to fisk university for college and taught

9:49

at atlanta a university in atlanta i think in some ways when you're an outsider looking in if you happen to be black the larger world will give you immense credibility and authenticity and whatever you say.

10:05

Yes.

10:06

You know what I mean? But your actual perception really is unique to how you're looking at the world.

10:11

It is. It is.

10:12

And it's interesting. I mean, as soon as you say, you know, a New England African-American goes down south. Exactly. It just immediately brings, you know, Gene Toomer's cabness to mind. Yes, Cain.

10:25

And cabness.

10:26

Yes.

10:27

That's right.

10:29

My favorite, I would say Cabnes is my second favorite Negro character in all of literature. Yes. I mean, he's better than Caliban. Yes. He's better than the Emperor Jones.

10:45

Yes.

10:47

And my favorite is Sixo, who's not very well known, but this is a character in Beloved. Okay. And maybe we'll talk about Sixo later. Sure. Excuse me. But... So did intellectuals and writers, Black, from the North come South and, based on their observations, contribute to this public image of the ghetto? Yes, they did, because it was reasonable...

11:17

in in you know before world war ii right to say most colored people are poor they have an incomplete education they're from the south they're yokels they're not factory workers they're not they're not participating in the industrial revolution they're still walking behind oxen and yeah how few of them have a college education

11:42

so here you get dubois saying We need this leadership of the African-American community, all of us, so that we can get on board, little children. And once again, he was Mr. Harvard PhD. He had the fancy education from Germany. I think he strolled through Atlanta, black neighborhoods. And southern black neighborhoods,

12:05

almost like as a as a European dandy, the way he dressed, the facial hair, the mustache, the goatee. So it's striking to me how once again, someone from kind of a cultural outside. comes down south and observes and creates what becomes the ghetto yes that's true

12:28

it is and i think i think soul has has gone uh to talk about i think he called it black rednecks yes how how how black folks enculturated that scots irish yeah redneck vibe And that's how a lot of them talk. I mean, it's really weird because when I moved from New York City uptown to Atlanta,

12:55

I walked downtown and I'm driving around and I get like four miles west of downtown and there's chickens walking in the street. And I'm like, what the heck? How do you have dirt roads and chickens walking in the street this close to the Big Peach, which I know something to do with the Big Apple.

13:19

But no, it's really strange. So, yeah, I think a lot of... African-Americans throughout the 19th and 20th century looking at the mass of us, looking at the Negro problem, whether or not these people deserve equality in America. How do you explain all this stuff? I mean, that was a big deal in those days.

13:45

And so when I look at Dubois and Washington and Woodson, I think they have three basic prescriptions. Mm-hmm. DuBois comes up with the idea of the talented 10th.

13:59

Yes.

13:59

Which he basically says, look, if 10% of us could go to college and graduate, then we could do well. That would be the leadership of Black American. We would have somebody articulate enough to say, this is what we should do. Do you accept that premise or not?

14:18

I did growing up, and I just naturally thought I was part of that. Right. I hear the song Young, Gifted, and Black, and I'm like, they're talking about me.

14:28

I'm going to be a black leader. Yes, exactly.

14:32

Exactly. you know because i was one of those kids who knew all the stanzas to lift every voice and sing right right and some people are just learning it today right oh it's the black national anthem well you have to learn that in jack and jill that's like

14:49

mandatory part of the curriculum really oh that's interesting oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so daddy the road we trod bit of the chastening rod But here's the thing, but Michael, you hinted, you hinted that you accepted that down to 10th premise without question when you were young. Has your perception changed now that you're a more seasoned elder?

15:12

Yes. And it changed even, you know, as a young man, as I perceived, you know, quite frankly, the limits of social conservatism of the black upper class.

15:26

Oh, explain, explain. Please explain what you mean by that.

15:30

Well, in my memoir, 17 Girlfriends.

15:33

Yes, yes, that's right.

15:34

A work in progress, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. I thought about the time because where I lived in West Adams was both ‚Äì ghetto proximate, and hill proximate. So a long time ago, I looked at black economics and I said, let's not talk about one huge black community. Let's be cognizant of class.

15:58

And mostly that is where you live. It's the biggest investment, your house, that you ever make in your life. And I said, let's divide black America into six parts. The top would be the hill.

16:15

Okay.

16:16

All right? Everybody kind of knows where the hill is. It would be Sugar Hill in Harlem or Bowie in Maryland, Prince George's County, right? Sure.

16:30

Or Church Hill in Richmond, Virginia. There you go.

16:33

So everybody knows where the rich black neighborhood is. The Gold Coast in Upper Northwest Washington, D.C. Money-earning Mount Vernon. Yeah. Right? Right. And then the burbs.

16:47

Yes.

16:47

So there's a good set of suburban blacks.

16:52

Right.

16:53

And then where I grew up was the hood.

16:55

Okay.

16:55

okay and they then they called it the inner city it was a neighborhood when it started right all right and then when my cohort went off to the military in college we came back and all the knuckleheads we used to slap around had taken over and then they started selling crack and the neighborhood became the hood because

17:15

nobody's neighbors now that's interesting because what you just said the knuckleheads taking over when you came back That resonates with the essay I wrote recently, you know, Living in a World of Ghetto Life, where E. Franklin Frazier, author of the underappreciated The Black Bourgeoisie, published in 1957, he argues that it was when the unlettered rough masses were

17:39

took over black colleges that the culture changed. That was Frazier's perspective. Yeah. That as a result, the, okay, a little bit of backstory. So I came up, E. Funk and Frazier says there are two cultural traditions in black America. And this is as of 1957. Okay. There are the masses,

17:59

which we kind of think of in terms of a caricature and stereotype, those who are of the descendants of slave cabins, those who had ancestors who picked cotton in southern plantations. Harpo. Harpo! You hit me, Harpo! And then there was a smaller cultural tradition of people who were mulatto, who were mixed, people who probably had

18:24

have siblings who were white. I'm thinking of U.S. Senator Blanche K. Bruce. I'm thinking of acting with Louisiana Governor PBS Pinchback. I'm thinking of my wife's great-great-grandfather, Congressman Joseph Hayne Rainey. These people More often came from a tradition where they had blood ties to the southern elite, to the upper class, to the slaveholding class.

18:52

And so their cultural orientation in life was always that of dynasty building. vision, family and a family. These were the kind of people who were buying acres of land after the Civil War, the broken promises of 40 acres and a mule notwithstanding. So that's the cultural tradition I knew through my grandma and my grandma's grandfather.

19:16

But E. Franklin Frazier says those people who originally were the leaders of black America

19:24

They got edged out at black colleges. Yeah,

19:26

that's very interesting because I saw some remnants of that culture when I went down and buried my last grandmother in Monroe, Louisiana.

19:40

Monroe, Louisiana.

19:41

I heard all of these tales about, you know, we were supposed to get this land from the river. Oh, yeah. All the way back. And we built our houses right on the edge of that. And that's my grandma's grandfather story. Apparently he was promised.

19:58

uh the plantation and a large parcel of land and a huge sum of money and when his father died uh he decided you know these townsfolk aren't too progressive in charlotte county virginia i don't think townies plantation but he did the next best thing in the deadness of night he stole into the big house and

20:20

He unlocked the safe, removed that large sum of money and left with his wife on the train up to Richmond, Virginia. And that's how he got his grew up stake in terms of, you know, founding a family and buying the mansion on the James River. Yeah, my great-grandfather started off in a little town in North Carolina,

20:43

and then he was sharecropping, and he knew everything about horses, and he went north to Connecticut and hung out with the horse he set.

20:54

There you go. There you go.

20:55

He's the equivalent of a BMW mechanic. Ah, gotcha, gotcha. With horses. The horses. And for those who are curious about my name, Winkfield, I have no relation whatsoever to the famous horse jockey Jimmy Winkfield, who I think won three Kentucky Derbies or something like that. It was a famous jockey in Russia.

21:17

But it was always a nice conversation starter when I was in grade school. Yeah, yeah, I know that guy. But in any event, you know, Michael, I want to push you back just a little bit because I love when I do that because we can get deeper and deeper. So you've said class is more important than race.

21:34

I think I wrote a recent essay about that called class. Yes, I agree. But I'm going to push back and say to you. if class is more important than race how do we explain how do we explain the demise the cancellation of the icon of people tv series back in 2021 after just one series

21:58

like if class really matters more than race why wouldn't the american public just be wowed by these stories of old black money and oak gloves and second homes and all the rest I don't know. I mean, I think there's... You've got to admit, and I call most everybody peasants.

22:18

I would say 85% of us are peasants.

22:21

And there's stratification in the middle class. There's lower middle class, middle middle class, upper middle class. But... Class has to be more important than race. And if race is a social construction, which it is, and class is a social construction, you can choose which one you want to use to make your way through America. Yes.

22:47

And class can be split into economic class and social class.

22:52

Okay.

22:53

And the economic class can kind of speak for itself. Sure.

22:56

Sure.

22:57

But the social class is also, to use that word, reified throughout society. I mean, there's things that you can do to demonstrate your social class. But what I'm suggesting, of course, is that The American public did not go crazy over a depiction of class.

23:17

No, they wouldn't because most people are kind of ordinary middle class and working class. And those people kind of say... Well, if they're upscale, then F them. They're going to be okay. But then how do you explain the importance, the popularity of, was it Dynasty with the Texas oil man?

23:42

Well, it's like, who do you want to be, right? Or Yellowstone. Remember Yellowstone? Another dynastic kind of story. That's new. That's 21st century. Oh, okay, okay, okay. I don't think you could make Yellowstone way back in the day. You would have Red River or Westerns, and that was a solitary hero.

24:04

It wasn't a whole big family of anybody because family dynasties have not been trusted. So I say that nobody's jumping up and down and happy about you know, Sididi Negroes because it's, there's, they're, they're not at the top of the heap in terms of what the average American wants to be.

24:29

And that didn't really happen until Denzel won his Oscar. All right. So when, when Denzel did the hunt for red October, I'm saying that's, was that the hunt of red October? Yeah. So he was, it was in a submarine movie.

24:47

Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

24:48

So when he played the XO on that and defied authority with the actual authority of the American rules, that made a lot of people stand up and salute. There's nothing you can do like that, not even what he did in St. Elsewhere as a doctor and a brilliant, handsome guy.

25:07

No, it's only when you pick up the American flag and you be an American hero that you get to be that person that represents the ambitions of everybody in America. And Denzel was the one who did it. But before him, it was Sidney Poitier. And I don't think Sidney did anything that was all-American.

25:29

He certainly demonstrated some dignity, as did Dorothy Dandridge before him. But I think Sidney was more class than race. I just think that that was part of his persona. No, I'm saying, yes. But then he was like... I mean, nobody ever got to see Sidney Poitier's family. He was a unicorn, right?

25:49

Oh, right.

25:50

You don't get to see Sidney Poitier's, you know, mama and grandmama who's making you sit properly at the table. So people didn't see that really until Cosby. Gotcha. I'm glad you mentioned the Cosby show. How does that support your thesis? Clause is more important than Grace. It is,

26:10

and people have been blacksplaining so much that they were surprised and shocked by the Cosby show.

26:15

Shocked? Shocked?

26:16

You mean they're black doctors and black lawyers?

26:19

Yes. What? Get out of here, Michael. Go to jail on that.

26:23

And you have to be realistic about, you know, 40s and 50s America when the mafia was still ruling stuff and Jews had a hard time getting into Harvard. I mean, talk about family dynasties. And I think we lost something when we threw out all the wasps with the racist backwater. Exactly. Someone else said that.

26:48

One of my commentators said that. I can't remember who it was, but he said that when we lost the idea of the WASP mindset and lifestyle as something aspirational, that also hurt the Black upper class. Yes, because that was the example.

27:09

Right, right, right, right.

27:10

So, yeah, I guess you got E. Franklin Frazier properly saying that, you know, everything is kind of even in our society, a constitutional republic. There is a kind of royalty that's associated with class and and, you know, people who decide to flaunt class or be rebellious against class and they bring that to their politics and their social.

27:41

Well, now you have a different people. And what I find interesting is, and you kind of touched upon that in a comment, it's not just money. It's not just money. You could be some famous rapper like, oh, I don't know, Jay-Z or Ice Cube or Ice-T or whatever, but you're not going to be perceived as...

28:07

Having a certain, what's the word I'm looking for? I don't want to sound elitist, because I'm not. A certain je ne sais quoi? A je ne sais quoi. You're not going to have the manners to be embraced warmly at the club in Sac Harbor. Right, right, right.

28:22

And the interesting thing is, when the public loves you, like they love Mr. T,

28:30

Yes.

28:31

Mr. T wore more gold chains than anybody. I mean, you look at the Urban Dictionary and the Internet says Mr. T started all that, which may or may not be true. Right. But it was like he's a lovable person. Everybody loved Mr. T because he was heroic.

28:49

Yes.

28:51

And when that happened, they loved him for him being Mr. T, not for the fact that he used to run, he used to own several large apartment buildings in New York.

29:03

Oh, I didn't know that. I didn't know that.

29:04

And he was a great landlord. And everybody said he's a great landlord.

29:09

Right, right.

29:10

And so he was making money before he got into TV.

29:15

That's good. I did not know that.

29:16

And it wasn't the money that people loved about Mr. T. Right, right, right, right, right. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. Yeah, so, I mean, what is your sense of, how can I put this? Does social class... in Black America means something different today in the year 2025 than it did,

29:44

say, back in 1957.

29:45

Oh, for sure, for sure, for sure. Let me continue on my sextet, which was the hill, the burbs, the hood.

29:54

Oh, yes, yes, yes.

29:55

And then the ghetto.

29:57

Yes.

29:57

And then below the ghetto is the projects. Oh. And below the projects is the sticks. Oh. Now, see, and these are, ladies and gentlemen, these are distinctions that are kind of new to me. I could not have drawn them out of a hat, which supports the thesis that if there are over 40 million black Americans,

30:18

ladies and gentlemen, there are over 40 million stories, experiences, and perspectives.

30:23

And where do they live? See, I started this somewhere around 1987 where I read this book called The Clustering of America by Michael J. Weiss. Funny, I can still remember that. And what he did was something that was right up my alley, which was look at demographics by zip code.

30:44

So he took every zip code in America and he made these demographic profiles and he started this company called Claritas. And this was like I remember that.

30:54

Yeah.

30:55

So he did. And at the same time, there was a book called The Nine Nations of North America.

31:01

Yes.

31:01

And somebody had that same thing. And they were like, America is not a melting pot. People stay different because they want to. Right. And. I immediately, like as soon as I was done with school, I moved into a neighborhood that was classified money and brains. This was money and brains where I lived in Hermosa Beach, California,

31:25

because there was a lot of aerospace engineers there. But anyway, so I said, huh, well, if we look at black America, how does black America segregate itself? And there's this cascade, you know, people in the burbs look up to the hill, like I want to live on the hill.

31:43

And that means Baldwin Hills and Windsor Hills in Los Angeles, Mount Airy. Yeah. And people in the hood want to get to the burbs and people in the ghetto want to get to the hood. Makes sense. And the worst place to be is the projects in LA.

32:01

Okay.

32:01

Because the projects here are Imperial Courts. Okay. Avalon Gardens. and and one more oh geez but the most notorious crip gangs came out of the projects all right that's public housing and and if you if you're from chicago you knew cabrini green yes yes or or uh the robert taylor homes right and in in new york

32:31

There's some projects. Oh, yeah, I'm sure. The Bricks City and Brownsville. And you're like, man, that's nasty. People throwing diapers out the window. Oh, yeah.

32:45

Yeah.

32:46

Now, does that go towards the whole manners thing in my essay? Well, I mean, if you live in the projects... Yes. You don't have to be old-mannered, though, Michael. Come now. Like, originally, as I understand it, and once again, just based upon reading, not personal knowledge,

33:02

I always thought that the projects were seen as desirable because it was a step up from not having... Tenement slums. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. So it was a step up. And so in some ways people were better behaved. But this is back in the 1950s, maybe the 1960s. Right.

33:21

I mean, I think anybody would have been happy to get out of a tenement. Right, right, right. You know, even though there's some lovely nostalgic tales about people. I think August Wilson may have written a play something about that with a little bit of upward mobility. Not the piano lesson, but something else. But still, I mean...

33:45

The tenement is as low as you can. You don't even have your own bathroom. There's one bathroom per floor. Wait, is this like that movie? Oh, what's it? A Raisin in the Sun. A Raisin in the Sun. Remember that?

33:57

Yes.

33:58

They didn't have their own bathroom. They had to go out and fall away. Yeah, yeah. So that's an example of a tenement. Yes. And a lot of New York was like that. And if you read them, oh, what is it? The Power Broker about this guy named Cato or Cato was the author. Anyway,

34:15

when we went through this phase of urban renewal and eminent domain to get rid of all that stuff. Right. That was that was part of it. But I mean. Yeah, I mean, Rick James, tenement slums and ghetto bums. The ghetto is real. But if you look at it, the ghetto is real. That's a quote for you.

34:37

But if you look at a raisin and a son, right, if I remember correctly, that family, they seem,

34:44

quote unquote, to be... Well-mannered. They seem to be prim and proper. They just have unfortunately considered. So what changed in terms of the manners aspect of it, the morals aspect of it? I think historically you have to look at the Great Migration and you have to look at the founding of the Urban League. And the NAACP.

35:08

In a good or bad way? In a good way. Okay. Because these people said, okay, I know my prospects are limited here in the South, and we can go back to the color purple. That's what Suge went. She took herself and her pretty boy. And they went up to Chicago and all of your farm knowledge,

35:30

all of your agrarian upbringing, you know, running around barefoot with overalls, picking cotton, with your cotton picking hands, get your cotton picking hands off of, you know, you had to learn. this new environment where, where, you know, you have to go to school. It's not a one room school house.

35:51

It's the industrial public school system, PS one 25, whatever it is. And so, yeah, you had, you had some of that beat into you, especially if you were Catholic, if you went to Catholic school. And so, yeah, that, that was a giant migration of millions and millions of people. off the farm and into the city.

36:15

And they start in the same places that immigrants fresh off the boat started, and they work their way into society. They have to correct their English and speech. They have to change the way they dress. They have to shine their shoes, put on a fedora, and that city life in the 40s and 50s.

36:33

And what people don't always appreciate is that when these people in the Great Migration were moving to Chicago or Detroit or Philadelphia... or Boston, there were already black people in those northern cities, and they had been there for generations. And people should recognize that they weren't always received a welcome, open arms,

36:54

that the old generations who had lived in Boston, for example, they very much perceived a difference. They very much perceived that these people were maybe not as lettered or not as polished or not as cultured as they were. So go ahead in the 40s, especially, you know, immediately post war. But but before that, too.

37:17

And anybody who reads Ebony magazine growing up would know once a year they would do the 100 most influential black Americans.

37:26

Right. Yeah.

37:28

And then you would get this like grand pole march of Omega sci-fi. And I'm like, who are these strange people? I felt the same way.

37:36

Thank you, Michael.

37:38

But the same thing was there used to be a lot of social clubs.

37:43

Yes.

37:44

For men and women.

37:46

Yes.

37:46

So there were these cosmopolitan clubs. And this was a place that you would learn some manners. You're like, I am going to... go be a Mason. I'm going to join the, the, the, the, the, uh, Prince, um, Prince hall. Yes. The Prince hall masons. And you get up to 32nd at 33rd degree.

38:10

And there's all these rituals and you have to dress up. Um, and I know my grandfather was in that generation. Uh, my grandfather in new England, um, Where that... And they had parades. Yes, yes. They literally had parades. And it was like, oh, there's beautiful Negro people. And those are the upright people. So...

38:35

a funny story michael i have a quick 60 seconds a funny story i want to share about that all right so one of the books i keep on my bookshelf is uh where is it here it is and i love this book so much i got it back in 1980 1988.

38:48

it's old money the mythology upper class by nelson w aldrich jr And the reason I picked this book right now is because there's a funny story in this book about old money people. So one day in the Upper East Side, there are these old stodgy old money types. They're all wasps.

39:07

And there's some fancy dancy club, invitation only. And they're just smoking their cigars and drinking their bourbon and brandy. And then one of the guys comes into the club late. And as he comes into the club, he recognizes that he's just passed one of these groups you're talking about. They're in a parade.

39:29

So he gets into the room and he says to all the old stodgy men with their cigars and brandy, I'm going to make you a bet. What's the bet? Let's say Preston. What's the bet, Preston? Well, I bet you you're going to see 100 black people go past this window in the next five minutes.

39:49

They all laugh.

39:50

I'll take that bet. I'll take that bet. Nicely. Nicely done. Get him some nice investment on that gamble. Very good, Winthrop. A little story, a little story. I watched a movie last night. I was completely bored yesterday, and I have these three-by-five cards with lists of movies.

40:16

So I go watch YouTube, and somebody will say, these are the 20 best blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. And so now I'm into the French New Wave.

40:24

Okay.

40:24

So I watched a movie last night called Le Samurai.

40:28

Mm-hmm.

40:29

And it's about a contract. I mean, there's nothing better than to look at this that was, I think, made in 1967 in Paris. And you see these people who live in these dank flats, all right? But they put on their jacket, their hat, their coat, and everything when they go out.

40:50

And the public is very simple, but it's also... Some some some manner of sophistication. And he goes to this club and I'm not going to give it away, but this is Paris in the 60s. And there's a woman, a woman from the Caribbean who's the jazz pianist. And she's lovely. She's just my type.

41:15

She's a Nancy Wilson type from the hair to the skin tone and everything. And you just forget that these places existed where you would have a drink and a smoke and everybody dresses up to go to these nightclubs. And it's fascinating to me to look at those old movies.

41:36

Even Jacques Tati, I'm going to go look at his again. So, yes, there was a single society back before the Cold War. And remember, in America, it got jump-started after the Depression. I mean, if you lived in Oklahoma in 1932, you were in sad shape. And for a long time, when I looked at black America, I'm like,

42:04

well, everything was reset in the Depression. Everybody went broke. People on Wall Street were jumping out the windows. So why do we need to go all the way back to slavery? You know, that's a great point, because I see that so often people when they talk about the American black story, they begin with slavery,

42:23

the slave narrative and how guilty they feel today. I was I was reading this article yesterday. by the sky and i may write an essay about it and he is a descendant of a family i think from north carolina and they own slaves so my reaction is well okay yeah not

42:43

surprised what else is new but in the essay he just tore himself up to pieces how horrible it felt how emotionally devastating it felt to have ancestors who had owned slaves and And and he couldn't believe that there might even have been blood relations between his white ancestors and black people with the same last name.

43:05

And he wrote a poem to his black distant cousins to show his grief and remorse. And I emailed him and also asked him, so did you DNA match these people? And if you did, Did you like say hi, introduce yourself, talk to them, learn their story?

43:24

I just sometimes felt like this guy viewed these people as these disembodied, abstracted victims that were probably still carrying the mental weight and trauma of slavery. When in fact, his distant cousins are probably like you and me. They're just living their lives and paying the baggage. And that's my difficulty with the whole slavery narrative thing.

43:48

It gives people an easy reason to not see the humanity in other people who happen to be black American. I guess that's my point. Yeah, I think the elephant in this room is black nationalism. Let's talk about it. Let's talk about it.

44:07

Because...

44:09

You know, the ultimate import of black nationalism, as far as I'm concerned, and believe me, my family was right dead center of that. And just, you know, just a hot... A hot pocket is that my father was one of the original Watts poets with Quincy Troop and, uh, and, uh, oh geez, the conservative guy who played football,

44:40

big guy, Stanley Crouch. Okay. Quincy, as you know, was at UCSD right at some point. University of California San Diego. I, I, I didn't know, but now I know.

44:52

Yep. Yep.

44:54

So anyway, um, The idea was basically, you know, Obviously, Fard Muhammad got the Muhammad Speaks magazine out there and then messaged to the black man, which is, you know, Christianity itself has been poisoned by the sin of American slavery. So you don't need to be having a Christian name. You need to change your name.

45:22

And with somebody like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Ahmad Jamal, And, you know, Malcolm X saying, I'm not going to take this slave name. That brought us all back. But it was a huge idea for a long time that black racial unity is a must. And so I think it got crossbred with W.E.B. Du Bois' Talented Tenth,

45:50

and I think that's how the Talented Tenth took some black privilege, as it were, and says, yes, we're going to lead everybody. We're going to be kings not just of our own neighborhood, not just the Hill, but But we're going to get all the masses, the black masses together.

46:13

So you have some Marxism in there, some millenarianism in there. All of this, you know, formed a perfect storm to the point where, you know, you got dap, you got high five, you got dashiki, you got Afro. You have a full expression of cultural things that want to make this unity.

46:36

which is something of a reversal of, well, what club are you from? Good point, good point. And black Episcopalians never get along with Southern Baptists. Those kind of marriages don't happen, right, in the old world. Right, right, right. And so what I think about from my perspective in life is, so how were black old families...

47:04

who had cherished the family church for, let's say, a century. Like, that's part of their identity, their way of being in the world. Or how they recycled these cherished family names, generation after generation after generation. How were they supposed to receive this Black nationalism? It almost seems like it attacks their sense of self. It does, it does.

47:27

I can remember... Curse my memory. When I'm on the playground and I say, you're in the FBI. You say, yeah, yeah, I'm in the FBI. I'm cool. No, fat, black, and ignorant. And you call somebody black and they hated that. They didn't want to hear it. So there's some of that paper bag, color struck.

47:52

Right.

47:53

Identity in there. But a lot of people wanted to be Negroes and they didn't want to be black. And so there was there was that strain of Marxism that rejected the black church. And that was the thing that was very hard to deal with. Right.

48:10

You have people like like like I mean, what did the Black Panthers want to do? but create a new church, right? But there was going to be a revolutionary thing. And Angela Davis was going to be a revolutionary thing.

48:24

I hear you.

48:25

Oh, by the way, good old Angela Davis, the descendant of the Mayflower, right?

48:29

The descendant of the original pilgrims.

48:36

This is a good conversation because as i said before i won't repeat my old uh mantra here but everyone kind of comes into the world and if you're born a black american you learn to understand the world through memories and family rituals and family customs so if some outside movement tries to rewrite that.

49:02

There's a human visceral response to that. You're just not going to buy it because someone else is trying to tell you who you should be. And the converse is so true. The converse is so true. If you grew up in the projects and you don't know who your father was and people are telling you you're black,

49:25

you got to have somebody to tell you what does it mean to be black. That's a good point. Talk about that, Michael. Talk about that. Then you want to hear Eldridge Cleaver's story. You want to hear Malcolm X's story. I read Native Son by Richard Wright talking about Bigger Thomas. I said, I don't relate to this person.

49:51

This person, that's nothing to do with me, right? And then I read The Man Who Lived Underground, and I think that was Ellison. And I'm like, I see this beautiful, complete rebellion. It's like... Dostoevsky's, you know, the Dostoevsky, the guy who commits the crime.

50:13

Is that crime and punishment? Crime and punishment. Okay.

50:16

Yes. And you feel that alienation of this outsider.

50:20

Right, right, right.

50:21

But if you're in the Talented Tenth and you believe in the revolution, you're like, we have to rescue that person or we have to get that person on stage to tell their story like Malcolm X, how you can be redeemed by the revolution. Oh, I see. It's like the Northern abolitionists dragging Frederick Douglass on stage in the

50:41

1840s to talk about the evils of American slavery because it serves the greater good. But the problem is, I don't really think there's a greater good that's served by radical Aussie people. That's just me. I don't know. It seems to me. Now, once again, are these people just not open to the idea of black enterprise, quote unquote,

51:03

as a way of blackness in America? I guess that's my question to you. I think they said that's a narrow thing. That's a narrow thing.

51:12

It's a narrow thing. That's interesting.

51:15

Get in where you fit in. But then if you be talking like this from New Orleans, and you're not going to try to fake that to anybody else. Right, right. I'm talking like my New Orleans cousins there. Yes, yes. Some of them like that. Yeah. You're just like, well, what you're doing is tomming.

51:35

You're trying to be white.

51:37

Oh, oh, yep, that's right. There's an author who I recently learned about. He's a black male graduate of Harvard Law School. And he wrote a book called In Defense of Uncle Tom, The Need to Police Racial Loyalty and Racial Solidarity. And Michael, that is just like anathema. Yeah.

51:57

This is anathema to how I grew up and perceived the world. So my question to you is, is it the case, maybe, that more people just need to divorce themselves from some subcultures in Black America because there's just, like, no overlap, right? Like, if you're someone who really believes... I think, yes, I do. I do believe that.

52:19

Yeah.

52:20

Talk about that.

52:23

Because if you divorce subcultures, aren't you accused then of being a traitor, of being disloyal, of being a Benedict Arnold? Talk about that. Yes, you are. Okay. And those are the echoes of black nationalism. Oh, so there wasn't such a thing as Uncle Tomism before black nationalism. Right. Not so much.

52:46

I don't know if that was brought up by Washington or Woodson or Du Bois. Well, Du Bois really didn't think much of Washington, remember? No, I know. Yeah, he trashed him. But he didn't call him names, I don't think.

53:01

I can't remember.

53:02

Right, but I don't know how that Uncle Tom thing came. It was a sorry operation, just to say.

53:10

Yeah.

53:13

Ladies and gentlemen, you heard it here.

53:15

This morning was a CIA operation to divide people. Yes.

53:20

A compartmented, top secret.

53:25

Right, right, right. Right.

53:27

It was in the weed. It was in the weed. It was in the weed. Shipped in from Dallas. Yeah, they put in some paraquat on the weed. Made us hallucinate. That was GPT-1. That's a great screenplay idea for someone. There's a listener out there who has artistic chops. A wonderful movie, fictional, about how the CIA...

53:55

infiltrated the talented 10 and created this idea of Uncle Tomism.

54:00

I love that idea. I love that idea, Michael.

54:04

Yeah, because, I mean, everybody knows the Klan are bad guys.

54:07

That script writes itself. You've got to think of something more interesting.

54:13

We're going to get so much, hopefully. Well, good, good. I want it. I mean, the interesting thing, again, and this is where Black History Month is a continuation of that. Because, you know, you'd have real historians like John Hope Franklin. No, I mean, with scholarly chops. Right, right. All right.

54:36

And those are mixed up with those particular folks that prey on the inner city young black male that says the world is against you. Here's how you get some pride in your blackness.

54:50

Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

54:53

And to a certain degree, that's as old as the hills, right? Old as the hills, old as the hills. And a lot of people did it by going to the army, right? Yeah. Gomer Pyle you have these you know and the sergeant the drill sergeant is the

55:12

person who's doing that and a soldier story is a perfect example of that where you have this segregated unit and that's the kind of hard thing what I think about the pain of Jim Crow and of segregation is that you are forced to live in a place where

55:32

you actually don't have a lot in common with the other people who were there Oh, that sounds like one of my recent essays on class where you have W.B. Du Bois in some apartment in Harlem, 1930s. And he's just listening to people talk. And these people, I think there was a teacher, a nurse, a lawyer,

55:52

an insurance agent, maybe a social worker or a teacher. I forget. But they're just being very open about how they view the masses on the street of Harlem.

56:02

Right.

56:02

And it's not very complimentary. No, it's not. And I don't believe Du Bois corrected them or took offense. He was just listening. He was just observing. Tell me what you're thinking. So, I mean, to me, you're right. I mean, there have always been these differences. And I wonder, here's a hard question for you, Michael, though.

56:24

Is there more that these people could have done in the 1930s in Harlem to have ensured that the better class of manners and aspiration triumphed? Because ultimately they did lose, I think, the cultural war. Well, here's the rub. And I'm... We're going to call this the subtext of Lurie's girlfriend. Oh. All right.

57:01

Which is when you get to the talented 10th, when you have American success that's recognized even in the mainstream, Who's vulnerable to you? Who's the most vulnerable to you? Those black folks maybe from the projects or the ghetto who are trying to hit the big time, right? And certainly the young women would be vulnerable to you.

57:27

So how when you kind of come to recognize the limits of middle class power, economic power, because probably the best thing you could actually do is get somebody a job or give them a break, help a brother out. Right? Give Earl Graves Senior a little scholarship money, right? Right, right.

57:49

And there's not a lot of black businesses that are going to hire people to do that. And so you're trying to lend some economic a little bit, but more social. I can help you socially. Right. And there's some quid pro quo there.

58:09

Yeah.

58:10

So I think... A lot of ministers are in that position where they're trying to get their congregation a little bit more social capital by whatever means. But there's only so much uplift that you can do. I agree with you.

58:31

I mean,

58:31

Jesse Jackson had famous Operation Push, came to every black neighborhood you could think of. But it ultimately... It's it's it's down to your family and what you can do in your family. I had a commentator. He asked me, well, you know, there's this group and they're called the Belay. And it looks like they're very elite and influential.

58:56

Couldn't they solve the problem? And I said, well, you know, five thousand people versus 40 million. But he really thought because they are so elite that they could, if they so chose, turn the switch on the culture. And I said, no. No. No. Because ghetto guys can get ghetto girls. And hood guys can get hood girls.

59:24

And burb guys can get burb girls. So, I mean, how are you going to turn any of that around? Yeah. What black nationalism did on the positive side was to unleash people from comparing themselves to white people. Which is good. Which is good. Right. It's like, I am not stuck in this race bag.

59:48

I can say black is beautiful. But Michael, a little bit of pushback, because that makes it interesting for our listeners, didn't Howard President Mordecai Johnson, Howard Law School Dean Charlie Houston, Thurgood Marshall in the 1930s and 40s already feel that way. I don't sense the Thurgood Marshall thinking. Go ahead.

1:00:10

Yes.

1:00:11

Yeah, you're right. They did. But I mean, again, there is. If you're just the 5,000 and the boule, you're going to keep to yourself. This is true, ladies and gentlemen. You don't want to be deluded and be taken... as one of the black masses and that's a harsh truth ladies and gentlemen that's a

1:00:34

harsh truth that it's very easy for one's um values and attitudes to be oh what's the word co-opted overtaken overrun yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so so you get in where you fit in you get in where you fit in i like that and be glad for what you can get yeah because I mean, the interesting thing,

1:00:57

I can remember being a kid and living close to Crenshaw Boulevard and the Angelus Funeral Home, an institution as distinctive as its name, was this palatial place like with gold leaf.

1:01:11

Right.

1:01:12

And every once in a while on a Sunday, there would be a huge funeral. I mean, huge. And I don't. know what that aspect of black culture is but then you see it and you're like oh they got six motorcycles they got the hearse they got 25 cadillacs oh there's

1:01:33

somebody in a corvette oh there's somebody in a mercedes i want my funeral to be like that and it's like you get some sense of black people making it and you're like i have no idea who that was who just died I mean, if I could get six cars in my funeral. I'm going to plug someone.

1:01:56

I never do this, but this is a calendar. One of the things you know, Michael, of course, is that black funeral homes love to have calendars for the church.

1:02:04

Oh, yes.

1:02:04

Yes, yes, they do.

1:02:05

And fans. And fans. Yes, yes, yes, and fans. You're so black, Michael. So this is a...

1:02:13

So this is a calendar from the Manning Funeral and Cremation Services in Richmond, Virginia. They did the funeral for my cousin Bruce and my sister. But I remember going into their funeral home, and it was like a different world. They were clearly blue-blood people. They were people who were just very comfortable with...

1:02:43

To use a phrase for one of my essays, one got the sense money was just there.

1:02:48

Yeah.

1:02:48

That that was due to the success of parents and grandparents.

1:02:52

Yeah.

1:02:52

And that's a part of black America most outsiders never really see. Yeah. They just don't. But these people, they are quietly doing their thing. And over the generations, they're just keeping their financial capital and social capital. And I think that's one of the ways in which we got off the wrong track with black nationalism.

1:03:17

You didn't need to have black nationalism if you had proven stories of black enterprise. Right. I think most kids would rather be successful and comfortable and have that for their children and grandchildren rather than wear a dashiki and the kinti cloth. All right. Now here's where I'm going to push you back.

1:03:39

Push. Please. Please do. Please do.

1:03:42

So the black enterprise world and the old money world. Yes.

1:03:47

Yes.

1:03:49

again they had this social conservatism and they were sticking tight to themselves yes yes yes yes and i can remember you know reminiscing about my girlfriends yeah was one of them that uh in los angeles went to westlake school for girls okay And Westlake School for Girls merged with Harvard School. It's now called Harvard-Westlake.

1:04:14

And this is probably the most prestigious private school on the West Coast. Yes, most definitely. And so I went to her... cotillion in the marina city club so she literally rented out a whole floor of these towers over marina del rey and then i went to i went to one of her parties at

1:04:39

west lake yes and we ended up making out on the tennis courts oh michael So one day I decide to go visit her house.

1:04:51

Okay.

1:04:51

And she lives in Windsor Hills, of course.

1:04:53

Right.

1:04:54

And her mother took one look at me and said, you dirty Negro.

1:05:00

Oh, no, no, no.

1:05:03

Who is this boy? No, she did not. No, she did not. Who is this?

1:05:07

Yeah.

1:05:08

I can see it. I can see it in her eyes.

1:05:10

Mom has just failed Black Old Money 101. Rule number one is don't propose marriage to your cousin. But rule number two is one shows decorum and courtesy and manners. She did not. She failed the test. She now has to go back to the... rear the line and try again.

1:05:32

Right.

1:05:32

I kind of knocked on the door and said, can Marcy come out to play? She was like, who is this? I would fuck her big time. I would fuck her big time. Michael, you're better than that. You're better than that, of course. Well, I eventually learned. But again, that social conservatism

1:05:56

I think there are people who are black who are afraid to be black in public.

1:06:01

Ooh, let's talk about that. What do you mean by that? Do you mean people who don't confess their Jack and Jill membership in white circles?

1:06:12

No, I think it means... I don't know. This is one of those complex and subtle dynamics. Sure. And I don't read enough fiction to see that anywhere. I mean, I thought I was going to write a book. I may still. But just about class differences within black America. Sure. And just, you know,

1:06:36

what it's like to live on the wrong side of the tracks and go to school with the kids on the right side of the tracks.

1:06:42

Mm-hmm.

1:06:43

but hang out and play football with your homies. I know a woman, and maybe she fits into your thesis here, I know a woman who never felt the need to tell her students that she was black she just didn't think it was necessary most students

1:07:02

presume she was italian and i thought that was interesting because she's a very proud black woman at home but when she's out she just doesn't feel the need to tell people does she fit inside your thesis or not no no my thesis is more like this um And I always use Whoopi Goldberg as an example.

1:07:24

Whoopi Goldberg, you know, had money. And when she first got famous, she would go to Europe and she would have fun going to Europe, Paris, London, you know, Rome. But then when she came back to New York City, she was just so happy she could be incognito. Right.

1:07:41

Which is like you're amongst so many black people that even though they're not like you, it's like you don't stand out anymore. Right. Right. So it it feels a little bit like home because you can go undercover. And so I think I mean,

1:07:58

I've known people who live in the hills and they want to go to a party in the hood and then crips show up.

1:08:08

Well, that's, you know, bye, goodbye. Right?

1:08:11

So it's like you want to go to a club, you want to party with everybody else, but somebody shows the element. We used to call them the element. The element. I like that word. The element would show up. The masses have become the element. Yep. And so, no, not the masses, just the element.

1:08:30

The element, okay.

1:08:31

And under the guise of black unity, you're supposed to let everybody in, right? Yeah.

1:08:36

Solidarity.

1:08:37

That's right. Solidarity. Yeah. Right.

1:08:39

So you're not supposed to you're not supposed to bag on these people, some of whom are actually dangerous. I mean, yeah. Common sense to me, Michael, common sense has to trump racial solidarity. Yes. And when it does and when it does, that's when, you know, the Comus Club retracts to itself. Right.

1:09:03

But I think that's good, though, because it's self-preservation.

1:09:06

No, it is.

1:09:08

It is.

1:09:08

I think that's good. So there's this tension. within black america that still exists because of the success of black nationalism and the culture that it sure that it generated between i want to be faithful and true to myself and my family and my church yes that ain't you guys that ain't none

1:09:29

of y'all yes right true story true story ladies and gentlemen a few years ago a couple of ladies from the uh local jack and jill chapter We're having a nice little dinner in Hillcrest, which is a part of San Diego downtown. And they were just enjoying themselves and they were preparing to leave. And they heard some noise.

1:09:49

It went on for maybe 15, 20 seconds. And they didn't think much of it, didn't know what it was. And then someone told them, oh, you should leave now. There's an active shooter. There's a gunfire. And one of the ladies said to the other ladies, man, we're so isolated. We don't even know what guns sound like.

1:10:13

But when you hear it, you'll know. I thought that was funny that they all were like, what is that? Whereas people tend to presume, of course, Michael, that if you're a black American, you must know the sound of gunfire.

1:10:28

Yeah, yeah.

1:10:29

But so that goes under premise number three, which is class differences within black America are real. They are real. I agree with you. I agree with you. But, Michael, I'm going to push back just a little bit and say... Don't we know that already? Don't we know that already? Yes, we know that already. Right.

1:10:50

And that's where the public fight comes in. Okay. And so that leads to the new meme that now everybody knows, which is, what is it? What is it? Black Fatigue. Black Fatigue. And that's the same conversation that's been going on since the 30s. Since the 1950s, since the 1930s. Yeah. Yeah.

1:11:11

And so that I think I think black fatigue in that way is better. Because it undermines racial unity and it undermines, you know, white identity. Oh, I see your point. I see your point. You have to undermine all of these racial classifications and find other things to rally around than race.

1:11:42

Right.

1:11:44

And then nobody has the race excuse, right? And it weakens race. Okay, I'm going to give you some hypothetical critiques. Critique number one. Well, you're just furthering white supremacy when you talk about black fatigue. All right, what do you say to that, Michael? I say, are French people white? Yes. Why? Because of how they look.

1:12:08

So they're the same white as rednecks in Georgia. They're all descendants of the colonizer. Next. Okay. Well, see, that's facile. And that's the way you want to play it. I'm just like, fine. And the interesting thing is such a person would never have the courage to have a white member in their own family.

1:12:39

I want to agree with you so badly, but don't we see examples of people like that who, surprise, surprise, have white spouses? Well, you know... When that marriage lasts for 20 years, then it's not jungle fever. When they raise their kids all looking like Jaden Smith. No, but really.

1:13:12

At some point, the white supremacy only works if you believe that race is is essential all right so white supremacy builds on the premise of racial essentialism which is it doesn't matter one black one drop of black blood you're black Which is why Walter White is black, Gene Toomer is black, PBS Pinchback is black,

1:13:43

Adam Clayton Powell IV is black, et cetera,

1:13:45

et cetera.

1:13:46

And as soon as you start talking black history like that, you're like, well, why are you adopting those people as black? They have nothing in common with people with no names that we know. And you're not even looking at their skin color, right? You are looking at their personal achievements. And you're putting those above race.

1:14:02

And then you kind of try to glom race onto it on the back end. And that's what Black History Month does. It gives you all the nice positives. And then you can feel good about being black. But if you were psychologically straight and healthy from the gate, you wouldn't need that.

1:14:17

You can see, okay, these are Americans or these are Europeans or these are Africans. And I can deal with that. And so the thing we're not getting away from is the problems of racial essentialism. We're not getting away from it. And that's kind of the poison.

1:14:39

I do my small part, I think, and I think you will agree. When I live by the mantra, if there are over 40 million black Americans, there are over 40 million stories, experiences, and perspectives, I think that mindset kills racial essentialism. It does, but how does ESG keep working? How does DEI keep working?

1:15:03

Because they have not seen the light. They have not adopted my mantra anymore. Right, so there are these institutional forces which are animated by racial essentialism.

1:15:14

Exactly.

1:15:15

And the problem is the resentment, the resentment that comes back. So now you have the white pride Karens who are saying, you know, look what those Negroes did to the Carnival Cruise Line. We have to put a quota so we can have that many black people in the pool. But this supports your point so well, Michael.

1:15:44

Why doesn't the Karen look at those people and say, look at those individuals who are uncouth and ill-mannered. Why must it be race? That supports your point, that she's essentializing them. Because, and this is the big one, sorry, is because we have what Cornel West calls nihilism in black culture. Oh, what does that mean? That sounds juicy.

1:16:11

That means people who feel like, how I said it before is their spirit has been killed, but we could say America's against me and America's against people like me. And so this is a kind of a psychological kind of racial construction of the self. And so I have a right to be hostile.

1:16:33

I have a right to be ghetto. And ghetto superstars, you know, we got that. But ghetto-ness can be unattached from race. Well, I don't know. I mean... I mean, Jews were ghetto, if you think about it, right? Right. But... then I have to ask this question that I beg. Is Kendrick Lamar ghetto?

1:17:02

Is that the guy, the Super Bowl guy who did the... Yes. We should define... You know what's funny? We haven't defined our terms, have we? How do you define ghetto? I think there's a ghetto culture. I think it's a commercial consumer culture that, you know, big studio executives like Jay-Z, who is one now... Used to make money.

1:17:27

But you didn't define, you just said, what defines that culture? Ghetto is kind of a... Go ahead.

1:17:34

Be honest.

1:17:34

A punk... No, not punk. No, no, no. It's rebellious.

1:17:40

It's rebellious.

1:17:41

That's good. All right.

1:17:42

That's good.

1:17:43

And it builds on some of the gang culture.

1:17:45

That's good. I like that. All right.

1:17:47

Because you wear a long white T-shirt and sagging and Jordans, unfortunately. I agree. So you have. I would also say, to add to the definition, I would say use of profanity. Oh. Yeah, because I do not use profanity, which is another way which I'm different. I was going to say, beep, yeah.

1:18:11

Profanity, I would also say, oh, I was going to say something else. Oh, oppositional defiant disorder, I would say.

1:18:21

Yeah, and that is a cycle. That is a cycle. Right, right. So Biggie Smalls experiences it So it's imprinted on his mind.

1:18:33

Right.

1:18:33

And the only way he can get out is... I mean, if you... I've listened to that Biggie Smalls album, and it's depressing as hell. What does he talk about? Oh, my God. You just have to say... Just go listen to Ready to Die, that album. Well, those words alone say a lot. Yeah, yeah. Right.

1:18:55

That is a genius. That is like... Raskolnikov, right?

1:19:00

Right, right.

1:19:02

And there's a cycle there. And I would say there's a segment of the, let's call it the Temple University School of Black Professorship.

1:19:15

Oh, okay.

1:19:17

That looks at... you know, dysfunctional black culture and valorizes it and legitimates it in the commercial music and style and urban-themed industry. I mean, one of the things I always feel is, I try to imagine Earl Graves as the head of a major record company. He would never in a million years. Yeah. He never.

1:19:45

He would sign Nancy Wilson. He would not sign Sexy Red. Right. He would sign Marilyn McCoo. Yes. And Billy Davis Jr. Right. Right. And we get songs like from Peaches and Herb. Nice songs. Romantic duets. Yes. Yes. Instead of these guys with grills and tattoos on their face. Yes. Talking about Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci game.

1:20:08

When people consume music like that, and I first heard the term ratchet, quote unquote. I remember I was in Caroline's bedroom and the boys came in and my oldest son said, Caroline, you're just being so ratchet. And I was like, what does that mean, ratchet? And did they explain?

1:20:28

And so that's why I remember learning that term for the first time in her bedroom. But the point is, when that music is consumed by your mind, I believe it changes your neural pathways. I think it changes the way you operate. And to me, that's horrendous. It's horrendously corrupting of society. Yes, yes, yes.

1:20:52

Not just the listener, but society in general. Because you know that there's crossover. Right. Yes, yes, yes, and yes. You know that this is a commercial success across demographics, okay? That's right, that's right. The fashion, everything. The big shirts, the gold chains. There's variations, yes, on the flavor, but that is its own style.

1:21:21

I had a commentator ask me, he was a reverend, he said to me, I see everything that you see, I loved your Ghetto Life essay, but what can we do to make a difference for the young people. I know. I replied, as an outsider looking in, right, with my ghetto credentials, I replied, look, look,

1:21:42

maybe we need to raise kids who love themselves, who self-respect themselves, so that when presented with pathology, they just say no because they love themselves and it doesn't go right. That's the formula.

1:21:57

That's the formula.

1:21:58

That's what I said. Do not allow your kids to be bad. Thank you. So that when they try to be bad, they'll find that they're bad at being bad. Thank you, Michael. You know, listeners, ladies and gentlemen, if there's one thing you take away from today, that is it. That is it. And I really think my parents,

1:22:19

my grandparents, my ancestors going back to slave times lived by that creed. And you know what's funny? The person who told me that was Russian. Really? And where I was, I was in Boise, Idaho. That's funny. And we were watching Michael Jackson hang his baby out of the window.

1:22:41

Yeah.

1:22:41

Remember that famous thing?

1:22:42

I remember, yeah.

1:22:43

And we were talking about how the hell did he do that? What's wrong with him? Right? He says, you know, it's Michael Jackson. He does what he wants to do. Right. So he's unleashed in a bad way, nihilistic. Right. So, yeah, because he's trying to prove that he's bad. Right. Right. He's bad. He's bad.

1:23:01

But if you love yourself, if you respect yourself, if you secure yourself, you don't need to dangle your baby outside of the window. You know, I think that's a message that Michael Jackson actually learned. I think he really, I think, you know, he had to prove that he was bad. Yeah. And he did that album.

1:23:23

And by the time he did Dangerous, Dangerous was a great album. I think that's Michael Jackson's best album for what it's worth. I love that album. Do you think black nationalism caused ghetto people, for lack of a better word, To hate themselves or to be open to negative images in music. No, they were leveraged.

1:23:51

The black masses were leveraged. And I could reduce this down to two words and everybody would know exactly what I'm thinking. Public enemy.

1:24:04

Okay,

1:24:05

and for those who do not know about Public Enemy, could you take a moment or two and review? Public Enemy was the most revolutionary rap act that ever happened. And I say revolutionary thoughtfully and saying, you know, they revered the revolutionary spirit of,

1:24:30

And when I say I got a right to be hostile, that's actually quoting Flava Flav. That was, you know, there's black steel in the hour of chaos. It takes a nation of a million to hold us back. There's just so much of that. And of course, like the best of rap,

1:24:55

it represents an area code where you talk about the nasty ghetto that you grew up in. and driving your 98 Oldsmobile, and then you get to be a star in the ghetto. I don't care what the people up there say. I'm going to be okay. And ghetto superstar, you know.

1:25:16

So that whole idea is part of the mainstream of that art. And rap has not had a lot of good critics. I mean, because there's been a lot of really good rap and hip hop And unfortunately, it just kind of collapsed with Gangsta.

1:25:39

And my boy Jimmy Israel, shout out to Jimmy, he was a writer at the source. And he knew what happened when the editors and the ownership gets corrupted and they're just doing stuff to promote rather than do real criticism. And there was a gangster element in that.

1:26:01

And one of the things I haven't said that I just have been reminded of is the influence of Italian mafia, Casanostra, ethics on black people. raising of all boats, but black ambitions have gone like that. And Public Enemy did that. They said, Black Caesar, let's go watch Black Caesar at the crib, right?

1:26:27

And this was really part of an artistic revolution that has not been replicated. I mean, you have nothing about Ice-T or Eric B. and Rakim has, I mean, I think Snoop is probably the most gangster of them, but it doesn't go towards that Marxist revolutionary idea of of like this is what black ghetto life means,

1:27:06

and you have to do this to get anywhere in America. That kind of Malcolm X message. More the Eldridge Cleaver message. So you know Eldridge Cleaver said black liberation comes from raping white women.

1:27:25

Okay, there you go. Yeah.

1:27:27

So there's this, you know, right to be hostile, mean mugging, cool pose aspects to many black artistic forms, especially hip hop. So far into the generation of my parents and grandparents. So far.

1:27:44

Yeah.

1:27:45

And it's like you kind of, I enjoy jazz for what it is.

1:27:52

Yeah.

1:27:53

And I enjoy jazz, how it changes. And one of my favorites is Jacques Lussier. And if you get the connection between French jazz and American jazz, and you know how this guy has blended classical and jazz phrasings in a way that nobody else has done. It's remarkable.

1:28:19

But you kind of just have to be a hermit about it. You have to be conservative and you have to conserve that part of the culture. And again, back to premise one, since the age of mass communications, you're not in control of your public image.

1:28:38

You just have to let your artistic expression or your consumption of that or your appreciation for that be its own reward. just like your economic security is its own reward. And if you let the specter of race essentialism fall away, then you don't feel bad about Kendrick LeVar. You're just like... True. That's true.

1:29:06

It's like we used to say to our parents, there goes your people. And she said, I didn't raise them. It's true. It's true. So it's not like we all don't go to jail. We all don't go to jail. Is there a premium you think... to be an introvert and a Black American? Because if you think about it,

1:29:28

an introverted Black American is less likely to take their signals from the outside world. They're more likely to process internally whether you agree or disagree with something, whether something makes sense or not. Could it be that introspection and introversion in Black America provides a safe haven against the control of the larger public image? What do you think?

1:29:51

I don't know. I think of, I mean, football season is just starting. So I'm looking at young black men competing on the field, and they've now come up with this habit of miking the coaches. So you can hear the coach talk about the play. Maybe, you know, he's a defensive coach when their team is on office. Yeah.

1:30:19

I honestly believe, like we have social capital in various industries and families, and... Like my kids, my kids don't feel self-conscious about anything that I might have felt self-conscious at coming up. And so, you know, being perceptive and articulate and degreed and good looking and not ghetto and staying away from ghetto and calling, you know,

1:30:49

as an epithet. Just just ordinary black middle class and upper middle class has become more and more commonplace.

1:30:58

It has. That's true.

1:31:00

So I think there's not so much social pressure to be united black. It's still out there. Those threads are still out there. And just a tiny, tiny counter to that. I do know through secondhand knowledge, this is hearsay, but I do sense that if one goes to the inkwell, to Oak Bluffs,

1:31:23

a summer vacation populated by some in Black America, that there is a decided embrace of and celebration of one's fraternity.

1:31:33

And that particularly the Omega, I shouldn't say this, particularly the Omega sci-fi.

1:31:40

Them Q dogs.

1:31:41

They have a reputation, shall we say, on the island. Yes.

1:31:45

Well, one of my slogans is that inside every alpha is a secret longing to be a Q.

1:31:54

Oh.

1:31:55

And inside every cue is a secret longing to be an alpha.

1:31:59

I like that. Yes. That's good. That's good.

1:32:02

Because everybody hates Kappas.

1:32:04

There you go. That's right. That's right. That's right.

1:32:10

oh my my we're having fun we're having fun today so what is this about boston you had listed the marriage race in boston as a possible topic oh so again i was reviewing uh for for for my memoir yes and thinking about the the women that i

1:32:28

dated uh and and loved in boston yes and i met this guy named uh let's call him chauncey okay i can't remember his name but everything about him was kind of like not the minister but the first deacon okay not particularly charismatic but you know well-dressed decent nice guy um and we you know we bet

1:32:57

which one of us is going to get married first? Because we're single, and we're kind of on the prowl, and we're trying to find out, are there any graduate students at Harvard that might be interesting? Northeastern, Boston U, where are we going to find a decent woman around here? And so just that kind of shared...

1:33:25

thing that we had and I think he was less of a I don't want to call myself a player or a stud, but I think he had fewer girlfriends than me. And I think he was more earnest for the earnest reasons where I was just like sick of breaking hearts and sick of being heartbroken.

1:33:49

And I'm just like, I am so tired of this. Here we go again, right? And just that idea of thinking about yourself as a marriageable black man and get taking that seriously as something that I, I never did until right about then. Oh, interesting. And, and it was just like, I don't date.

1:34:16

I have, I have my woman. Right. And, My history was like, oh, she wants to get married. I don't want to get married. Or there's other women that I won't even approach because I know they just want to get married. It's like they're not going to be my woman. They're going to be my bride or nothing.

1:34:38

And so we had that conversation. informal contest where we're like comparing notes and we're like where should we go and what should we do and it was it was it was very pleasant it was what they call in reddit um healthy black people or uplifting black people something like that i like that i like yeah

1:35:02

I think that's in my handbook, my old black money handbook, is date uplifting people. Try to find people who are going to raise you up and have positive. You don't go for the gutter, in other words. Yes, wholesome. That was the word. It's wholesome.

1:35:16

So if you go to Reddit, you'll find wholesome black people or something like that. Sure, sure. Yeah, and that is a class thing because you're looking to be middle class. You're elevating that. You're saying, I don't want to be around these ghetto women that I know I'm not going to marry,

1:35:36

no matter how much fun they might be at the club, blah, blah, blah. And so this is a definite kind of thing that you can adopt class, right? And then some people just kind of have it out of habit. Like, you know, he tried to get me to join this church on Mass Ave.

1:35:58

And it was the black church in Boston, the black bougie church.

1:36:03

On Mass Ave, okay.

1:36:04

On Mass Ave.

1:36:06

In Boston or Cambridge?

1:36:07

In Cambridge, Cambridge side, I'm pretty sure. And I remember also, you know, going to these little bars and clubs or, or diners that were black owned. And they would tell me stories about how Jews sold this church to a black congregation.

1:36:26

Yeah. That happens. Yeah.

1:36:28

Yeah. So, so there was this one church on Mass Ave, I think on Cambridge side, pretty sure. And it was like, Any visitors here? And you have to raise your hand. And they're like, oh, oh. Well, I hope you're here to be a member and not to chase the young ladies of this church.

1:36:51

And I was like, dang. It caught me out. But yeah, I like that we have a tradition of of saying, you know, how do we solve the Negro problem? And Du Bois had his angle, and Washington was cast down your bucket where you stand, and it was more of a be productive, and he founded Tuskegee,

1:37:17

which is a technical school. And then Woodson coming back on the miseducation of the Negro and saying, no more divinity stuff. You have to have a serious education. No more black studies. He would have said that. And then you combine that with William Julius Wilson, who talked about the declining significance of race.

1:37:40

And he's saying black people can express themselves in terms of economic class and status. That we work through all of this. And there's, as we discussed, all kinds of different threads. And... Would you consider E. Franklin Frazier and his book, The Black Bourgeoisie, part of the solution or not? I have unfortunately not read that.

1:38:07

I've only taken excerpt from that. But I think if anything has been written since the 90s, I don't know that it's significant. I don't know. I kind of think that. Only soul has continued that tradition, and everybody else has just gone to the critical theorists. What about, I mean, just to bring it home to the modern era,

1:38:34

what about Thomas Chatterton Williams and his epic Unlearning Race as a way to solve the race problems? I would love to read that maybe one of these days, but I'm already there. I mean, I know that I'm already there. Because both I and Chatterton Williams love Adrienne Piper.

1:38:54

Yes, I do too. She's great.

1:38:56

Adrienne Piper just set the blueprint for how you just you get race out of your life. I remember she had a famous interview with KRS-One, and she just says, you're not serious at all. I don't know why anybody takes you seriously.

1:39:16

And that felt good for me when I was in my late 20s when I first discovered Adrian Piper. But I think at long last, Black folks who go the raceless way, as Sheena Mason talks about, as well as everybody, and Camille Foster, these people are past it. They've already done that thing.

1:39:41

And more and more, I think we'll see them more forward in social talk. And... They'll be sophisticated, I think, like Musa Algarbi is. But in a lot of ways, a lot of black Americans are past race. And you can't make us feel guilty about what happens on Carnival Cruise.

1:40:10

We're not going to spend a lot of time doing black... black fatigue, because we're accustomed to conflicts among 40, 50 million of us that are old as dirt. Michael, I so agree. I'm where you are. I feel an honored member of that space. But I can tell you, because all these things are, of course, personal,

1:40:37

in my space, there continue to be family members who cling to the old ways. And I know them. I get the text message and odds are it's going to be race related. It's going to be about slavery or Jim Crow. It's going to be some outlandish extremist take on, on something.

1:40:58

So I find for me, even though I'm in that space that Gina Mason talks about or Adrian Piper, One has to always be mindful of the family influence, that one's always in a sense. What's the word? I don't want to say misaligned because that's kind of strong, but one is always brought back.

1:41:19

into the world of race essentialism by those who are... And I'm not really sure what the answer to that is. I once asked Wilfred Rowley, how do you handle that? And he didn't really have a good answer for me. And do you have a suggestion? How do you remain in that good space?

1:41:39

Well, here's a quatrain from a song that's very popular. It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small and the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all. It's time to see what I can do to test the limits and break through. No right, no wrong, no rules for me. I'm free. Let it go.

1:42:05

Let it go.

1:42:07

Frozen.

1:42:10

I love that.

1:42:12

Even Disney knows. Let it go.

1:42:18

Let's see. Oh, you know what?

1:42:20

And I, Michael, I have a quote back to you as well. So one quote deserves another. Here's my quote.

1:42:29

Intellectual loneliness isn't about wanting deep thoughts or deep talks. It's about realizing how few people can tolerate complexity.

1:42:43

It's noticing how quickly people rush to have an answer, not to understand, but to feel right.

1:42:51

Yeah.

1:42:51

It's watching people form entire worldviews off of headlines, vibes, and whatever reels told them last. Yeah. It's the silence that follows when you say something that doesn't fit neatly into someone's script. It's not arrogance. Yeah. It's exhaustion from always having to code switch between what you actually think

1:43:15

and what's safe to say around people who shut down and nuance. Whoa. And no one warns you. Once your brain learns to stretch, small talk doesn't just bore you. It alienates you. Yes. You're not looking for smart people. You're looking for people who are still thinking.

1:43:38

And ladies and gentlemen, that's why you listen to Michael and me, because we're still thinking. And with that, I say, John, Glenn, we're still in your tail. All right. This has been lovely. I've enjoyed this very much.

1:43:52

This was good.

1:43:54

Although we didn't walk too far through the ghetto, I guess.

1:43:57

That's true. That is true. We still have our possessions.

1:44:00

As Chris Rock said, there's a baby on the corner selling crack at three o'clock in the morning. We got to get out of there.

1:44:06

That's funny. That's funny.

1:44:09

Well, may the habits of discipline give you the courage to take the rising path. Take care, y'all.
