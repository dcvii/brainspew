Are we helping create the tools of our own obsolescence?

If that sounds like a question only a depressive or a stoner would ask, let us assure you: We are neither. We are early AI adopters.

We stand at the threshold of perhaps the most profound identity crisis humanity has ever faced. As AI systems increasingly match or exceed our cognitive abilities, we’re witnessing the twilight of human intellectual supremacy—a position we’ve held unchallenged for our entire existence. This transformation won’t arrive in some distant future; it’s unfolding now, reshaping not just our economy but our very understanding of what it means to be human beings.

We [are not doomers](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-plays-about-the-end-of-the-world); quite the opposite. One of us, Tyler, is a heavy user of this technology, and the other, Avital, is working at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) (the company that makes Claude) to usher it into the world.

Both of us have an intense conviction that this technology can usher in an age of human flourishing the likes of which we have never seen before. But we are equally convinced that progress will usher in a crisis about what it is to be human at all.

Our children and grandchildren will face a profound challenge: how to live meaningful lives in a world where they are no longer the smartest and most capable entities in it. To put it another way, they will have to figure out how to prevent AI from demoralizing them. But it is not just our descendants who will face the issue, it is increasingly obvious that we do, too.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asserted in a recent talk that GPT-5 will be smarter than *all of us*. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei [described the powerful AI systems](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-calls-agi-marketing-term-2025-1) to come as “a country of geniuses in a data center.” These are not radical predictions. They are nearly here.

In 2019, GPT-2 could barely count to five or string together coherent sentences. By 2023, GPT-4 was outperforming nearly 90 percent of human test-takers on medical licensing exams [and the bar exam](https://law.stanford.edu/2023/04/19/gpt-4-passes-the-bar-exam-what-that-means-for-artificial-intelligence-tools-in-the-legal-industry/). In 2024, [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) was answering questions about complex scientific diagrams and charts with over 94 percent accuracy. Leading researchers at frontier AI companies increasingly believe we’ll achieve AI systems that can match or exceed human cognitive capabilities across virtually all domains before 2030.

Much of the commentary and punditry about AI has focused on things like the future of paralegals or consultants. But these are minor topics that overlook the most fundamental, existential question we will soon face: What does it mean to be human in an age of superintelligent machines? What exactly is special about *our* minds? What is there left for our species to do?

The purpose of this essay is to talk about what is coming and how to protect ourselves from the demoralization of such marvels.

Before we get there, allow us to tell you a bit about our relationship with this world-changing technology.

**Here’s Avital:**

I was Claude pre-Claude. I once prided myself on how quickly I could write well. Memos, strategy documents, talking points—you name it. I could churn out 2,000 words an hour.

That skill is now obsolete. I can still write better than the models, but their speed far outmatches mine. And I know their quality will soon catch up—and then surpass—my own.

Every time I [use Claude](https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F%3F) to do a task at work, I feel conflicted. I am both impressed by our product and humbled by how easily it does what used to make me feel uniquely valuable.

It’s not just an issue at work. Claude has injected itself into my home life, too. My partner is brilliant—it’s a huge reason we are together. But now, sometimes when I have a tough question, I’ll think, *Should I ask my partner, or the model?* And sometimes I choose the model. It’s eerie and uncomfortable to see this tool move into a domain that used to be filled by someone I love.

It seems extraordinarily unlikely that humans—myself included—will be the smartest creatures along many intellectual dimensions, if any. Already, AI models are [winning medals](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-reaches-silver-medal-level-at-this-years-math-olympiad/#:~:text=According%20to%20these%20standards%2C%20the,It's%20hard%20to%20say.%E2%80%9D) in international advanced math and computing competitions. They have functionally saturated benchmarks on un-googleable PhD knowledge. While there is disagreement about more subtle intellectual skills such as poetry or creative writing, the models have made extraordinary gains here as well.

We typically give young people advice to “try to find a room where you are not the smartest person in it.” But any room with a laptop or mobile device now satisfies this criterion.

And it’s not just intelligence. AI systems sometimes also outperform on much more “human” skills, too.

Since joining Anthropic, I had been begging my mom to try Claude. She had casually used it a few times, but claimed it didn’t help much with her work. Then she had her first serious interaction with Claude—she asked about avoiding isolation after retiring from teaching. The response made her tear up multiple times. Something about its empathy—the listening words “ah” and “oh”; how it reassured her that her fears were understandable; the way it called her “thoughtful”; and its assertion that her words “resonated” both moved her deeply and unsettled her. It also just gave solid advice.

As she put it, we all want that kind of wise friend who will lean in and really listen, someone infinitely patient and nonjudgmental who can help us process our anxieties while nudging us gently toward greater wisdom. The fact that Claude outperformed her human circle at providing this kind of support left her with a profound sense of grief, even as she found herself immediately attributing personhood to it, catching herself using “he” instead of “it” when describing their conversation.

**Here’s Tyler:**

I am a professional economist, but there are plenty of things I don’t know. In the world before AI, I would turn to libraries, the internet, and also my colleagues. These days, I go to the top AI models. And they can answer almost all of my questions. I can try to make the questions artificially hard, or “out of distribution,” to use a more technical term, but when it comes to questions I might ask in the natural course of events, the top models have good answers. I cannot really stump them. I also am relieved that I don’t have to query my colleagues nearly as often.

Another way to put the point is that the top models are better economists than I am. Or at least they are along one medium, namely answering questions. They are not better at inspiring students, and they are not better at *posing* questions. Not yet, at least. But I think of knowing economics, and answering questions about economics, as fundamental to my job. If some other entity can surpass me at that task, I need to rethink what I am doing. It is only a matter of time before some of my other advantages slip away too.

Demoralization is one natural reaction to this—and I’ve felt that way. But that’s not my only emotion. I also find the new AIs exhilarating. To me they are like magic and witchcraft, something I had often speculated about but never imagined seeing right before my eyes. I find myself entranced by watching them operate, whether I am posing economics queries, learning music history from them, or using them to help me interpret Shakespeare. That is why I tolerate the demoralization.

On X I have seen a few people describe me as a “human GPT,” and a precursor to the current AIs. They meant that as flattery, because I know a lot of facts, and indeed I was flattered. But it also is disturbing. Because now we have a nonhuman [GPT](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/ai/what-is-gpt/#:~:text=it%20from%20scratch.-,Transformer,wide%20range%20of%20NLP%20tasks.) not to mention plenty of other very good models. And, when it comes to a command of knowledge, those strong AI services are beating me.

A while back [I tweeted](https://x.com/tylercowen/status/1845656495737745816): “I’ve grown not to entirely trust people who are not at least slightly demoralized by some of the more recent AI developments.” In other words, I think they are in a fog about what is going on, and so I do not trust their judgment.

I have a tenured job at a state university, and I am not personally worried about my future—not at age 63. But I do ask myself every day how I will stay relevant, and how I will avoid being someone who is riding off the slow decay of a system that cannot last.

**So, What Should We Do?**

You might think that most people will not face the demoralization issue to the same degree that we do. After all, Albert Einstein was pretty smart and famous, and his existence doesn’t seem to have made the human race feel bad.

AI will be different.

First, it is a *general* form of intelligence. You can’t say, “Well, Einstein did general relativity, but I have a pretty decent understanding of economics.” The machine beats you across the board—or soon will.

Second, most humans will be working with AI every day in their jobs. The AI will know most things about the job better than the humans. Every single workday, or maybe even every single hour, you will be reminded that you are doing the directing and the “filler” tasks the AI cannot, but it is doing most of the real thinking.

We don’t doubt that many people will be fine with that—and, in many cases, relieved to have so much of the intellectual burden removed from their shoulders. Still, for a society or civilization as a whole there is a critical and indeed quite large subclass of people who take pride in their brains.

What is to become of them and their sense of purpose?

Below we look at how the 8 billion of us currently sharing this planet will alter the way we work and live—and how we will raise our children and grandchildren given our coming reality.

### **Work**

![How to Survive Artificial Intelligence](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb0eee5c-cb53-4e2f-a67b-3923f3937be3_1024x651.jpeg)

The big story in the short-term is this: Blue-collar workers (carpenters, gardeners, handymen, and others who do physical labor) will become more valuable. And white-collar knowledge jobs, many of which are already near or under the waterline, like legal research and business consulting, will diminish in value. Ultimately, though, the people who will benefit most are those who use AI heavily to generate projects or guide them in their work.

There will also be new jobs. Many of these are hard to predict, but a few things seem likely. One is the energy sector, as strong AI will place significant demands on the U.S. energy infrastructure. Another area will be biomedicine, where the pace of scientific progress will dramatically accelerate. (The advent of more drugs and devices will mean more testing, more regulatory approval, and so on.) It also might be possible that the scientific advancements resulting from AI, such as cheaper water desalination, allow us to terraform more parts of the globe.

For these reasons, more jobs are likely to be outside rather than at a screen, compared to the status quo. And that may well be a good thing.

There also will be more coaches, mentors, and individuals who supply the services of inspiration. The AIs may be better therapists than humans, but lots of times we still desire human contact in our interactions, if only to satisfy our biological programming. The number of entertainers and comedians is likely to rise as well. (Maybe the AI can write funnier jokes, but most of us do not want to hear a robot deliver them.) For related reasons, we also can expect more humans to work as greeters, charmers, and flatterers.

For many jobs, such as building up businesses, persuading a judge or jury, or doing sales, humans will work alongside the AIs—at least for a while.

We see this already in software. AI allows people who are not very strong at coding, and in some cases, unable to code at all, to use AI systems to write software by specifying what they want in near natural language, admittedly with some human editing required. AI might allow analogous advances in many other technical fields.

“Being agentic” is an important human quality, and we expect the distribution of this trait, as expressed through actual behavior, to become more bimodal. That is, you either will work with the AIs to achieve all the more and become more agentic. Or you might respond by becoming passive and turning over more and more parts of your life to the models.

The most agentic people—people like Elon Musk and the CEOs of our future—may manage fairly large institutions, like companies, nonprofits, and parts of our government, with a handful of other people and plentiful AI tools. They will have a per person impact that was unimaginable in earlier times, save special cases such as FDR or Napoleon or Rockefeller.

But many other people—perhaps most—will be less agentic in their jobs. They will monitor and check the AIs, thus becoming testers and verifiers. Much of that work will be less creative than current tasks, less spontaneous, and also less proactive. These individuals may quite literally feel like “cogs in the machine.” They will be liberated from a lot of routine work, but they also may feel like box-checkers rather than agents of change.

In any case, we of the laptop class are more distanced from our labor than the small-plot farmer or the weaver on the handloom. With powerful AI, we will become more mediated still.

How will humans respond to these changes—particularly the extreme divisions when it comes to being agentic? One view is that many people will be frustrated by their more reactive, verification-heavy role in workplaces. The alternative view is that relatively few humans want to be bosses and entrepreneurs to begin with, and this new division of responsibilities will match human desires fairly closely, leading to a more satisfied workforce, and far more energy for outside pursuits.

### **Leisure**

![How to Survive Artificial Intelligence](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbba2e203-de6a-42c3-be2a-4b11d798f6e1_1024x689.jpeg)

So, will leisure time still fulfill us if we are working far less?

To live a happy and fulfilling life without work, one needs meaningful pursuits, social connection, and physical movement. We don’t expect any of those needs to go away in a world of AI ascendance. Indeed, those needs will likely become more intense.

Group hobbies and projects will proliferate, leading to a growth in sports, clubs, volunteering, religious services, walking, biking, and chasing your kids around, too.

Human taste will also become more important. We don’t doubt that the AIs can show great taste (just try asking them about the best Mozart recordings), but for so many matters of taste the key point is that it be *yours*.

What will matter is the song our mother recommends to us. The song a lover is entranced by. The song your child loves to hear before bedtime. The relative values of those pieces of music will rise to higher levels. As information becomes less scarce, we will seek other qualities from our relationships and douse ourselves in vividness, meaning, and emotional connection through interpersonal connections.

Given the ready tap of intelligence, we will place more value on other traits and value people more based on their style, charisma, generosity, kindness, beauty, honesty, or bravery.

We also will value other humans increasingly for their secrets, and for the non-legible knowledge they hold. AIs typically are trained on knowledge that is fairly generally available, and that makes human wisdom based on that same public knowledge less valuable. But your secrets will take on a special cachet, and sharing and trading them will become an important part of human interaction. More generally, non-legible, esoteric, and hidden forms of knowledge (or misinformation, as the case may be) will become more distinctly human.

The longer-term trend is toward more leisure time, and AI is likely to accelerate that trend. Depending on the policies that governments implement, more people may choose to not work at all. Even if there is no basic universal income, the calculus of benefits and costs may shift in a way where people retire earlier, or fewer people in the family may go to work in the first place.

### **Status**

![How to Survive Artificial Intelligence](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa69587c-6a73-43ea-873f-421e7887c87e_1024x679.jpeg)

AI will not create an egalitarian utopia. One thing that living with machines cannot change is our nature—and humans crave hierarchies and to be able to climb one rung above their peers. In this new world it will be increasingly important as a source of meaning. Since we will all be ranked below some other entity on intelligence, we will need to find new and different outlets for status competition.

Ideally, we’ll compete on our virtues, but maybe we’ll compete even harder on our looks, our physical strength, or how much AI systems like us—or some dimension as of yet unfathomable. Tech founder Avi Schiffmann suggests we will compete along the quality and interestingness of our [AI companions](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24207029/friend-ai-companion-gadget). (Perhaps eventually the AIs may compete along the dimension of how interesting their human companions are.)

These forthcoming dimensions of status may seem quite weird to us, but go back to 1800. How would people have reacted if you told them we humans will compete along the status dimensions of Balinese vacations, electric cars, and crypto assets? To many of them it seemed far more natural to take pride in milking a cow, wielding a hammer, or doing quality embroidery. Many of today’s status markers will someday take on a similar antiquated status, and it should not surprise us if some of those older status markers make partial comebacks.

### **Human-Only Spaces**

![How to Survive Artificial Intelligence](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27cad942-3d04-41cf-a809-8615c5bfdb2d_1024x683.jpeg)

While these evolving status games will provide one avenue for maintaining a sense of meaning, humans will likely seek other enclaves. Just as we’ve created nature preserves to maintain biodiversity in the face of development, we’ll likely create experiential preserves—spaces and activities intentionally designed to remain distinctly and exclusively human.

It is likely that advanced AI services will spread throughout the world at very different paces. Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Silicon Valley may be soaked in AI availability—in homes, workplaces, and public spaces—well before rural Mexico, Zambia, or Laos. You may wish to visit such places all the more, if only for the sake of variety and exoticism.

Different jurisdictions will also handle AI transitions differently, making location increasingly consequential. Some governments may embrace rapid AI integration while others implement stricter regulations. Some may use AI to surveil or constrain citizens, while others let AI unlock new opportunities and ways of living. These policy differences likely will substantially affect the quality of life, economic opportunities, personal freedom, and the distribution of wealth. Where you live, work, and hold citizenship may become more significant than at any point in recent history.

### **Longer Lives—For Our Children and Our Grandchildren**

![How to Survive Artificial Intelligence](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3080c91a-01fb-4d68-bf4c-9dd7e67fa616_1024x683.jpeg)

This is arguably the most incredible change of all.

You can debate the pace at which this will happen, but AI is going to extend our lives, the result of radical biomedical advances. A typical 26-year-old (Avital’s age) is likely to benefit significantly from having a longer life, a healthier life, and one less likely to be plagued by dementia or other maladies of the brain. Ten or 15 extra years seems likely, and for many people, we may do much better yet.

How can we prepare our children and grandchildren not just to live alongside AI—but to prepare them to live meaningful and far longer lives? What should you be doing to get them ready?

If you raise them as we raise children now, they will run the high risk of ending up demoralized. If you raise your children with the uncritical expectation that if they work hard they can be a top person in their field, they will be disappointed. The skill of getting good grades maps pretty closely to what the AIs are best at. You would do better to instill in your kids the quality of taking the initiative and the right kinds of intellectual humility. You should also, to the extent you can, teach them the value of charisma, making friends, and building out their networks.

Your children are going to see a very high rate of change. In essence, they might live through several quite different technological eras. So do not coddle them, and prepare them for this volatility accordingly.

Here’s a cheat sheet:

- Don’t set up being the smartest person in the room as the goal. Encourage them to develop to their fullest, challenge themselves, and to be virtuous.
- Encourage them to find many sources of meaning and social connection. They should develop hobbies and learn how to do self-directed projects, and actively seek out friends.
- Make it clear that meaningful endeavors don’t necessarily have to be compensated. Work is one way to contribute, but volunteering, making art, and building a family are some of the many others.
- Familiarize them with AI. Teach them how to learn from it and how to let it augment them.
- But choose their AI carefully! Don’t let them fall prey to the attentional black holes that will be built and offered to them.
- Don’t teach them to expect stability. Make it clear the world will likely change a lot, but that this change brings opportunities for them.

### Rebellion

Some UMBC students resorted to vandalism to express their outrage over a generative AI project. (Photo illustration by Justin Morrison/*Inside Higher Ed*)

We have many tricks up our sleeve, and we can find trouble in paradise should we need to. Indeed, there are early signs that we will want to.

In one episode in November at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, an exhibit of AI-generative art brought out hostility from the student body. Some of the art [was trashed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/academics/2025/02/10/making-space-student-sorrow-over-ai), some of it was protested, and students generated a petition that characterizes generative AI as a form of plagiarism.

In another recent example, Magnus Carlsen removed himself from the world championship chess cycle, mostly because he is no longer interested in enduring the extreme prep—mostly with AI—for competing in those matches. For Carlsen, this is computer work rather than playing “real chess.” Instead, he has insisted on [playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=UQeFBRv7AoY#:~:text=Magnus%20Carlsen%20dominated%20on%20his%20way%20to,on%20Twitch:%20https://www.twitch.tv/chess%20Follow%20us%20on%20Instagram:) rapid, speed, and blitz chess. He has also been playing Freestyle or “Fischer Random” chess, where the opening placement of the pieces is randomized, making extreme opening prep impossible. In this, Carlsen is ahead of the rest of the world in countering or bypassing the AIs to keep more meaning in his life.

The mini rebellions against AI are already here, and they could be a precursor of the future to come. After all, no machine is capable of changing human nature—at least not so far.

Powerful AI will transform our world. But our world has transformed many times—and few of us would choose to be on the other side of those transformations.

Humans are remarkably adaptable. We foraged and farmed, we built factories and spaceships, we wrote prayers, plays, poems, novels, and code. And now? Now we created this.
