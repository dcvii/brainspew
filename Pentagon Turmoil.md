### The Mooch Report—October 21, 2025

Some major moves happening over the last couple weeks at the Pentagon, one of which may presage additional reshuffling at top combatant commands.

Last week, Mooch had a great interview with our friend Brad Peniston, a veteran defense and Pentagon journalist and a frequent guest on the YouTube channel. Brad outlines the new rules established by the DoW public affairs office that prompted the exodus of most top Pentagon journalists from the building.

We also take a look at the recent resignation of Adm. Alvin Holsey, the CO of SOUTHCOM. While no reason was given for his resignation, rumor has it that he disagreed with President Trump’s anti-narcotics policies in the region. Mooch examines whether this abrupt departure could lead to more resignations at the highest levels of the Pentagon.

Stay tuned for more updates. And as always, keep us posted on your thoughts and feedback.

U.S. Navy Admiral Alvin Holsey, the head of U.S. Southern Command, has announced he is resigning from his position after only one year of what is normally a three-year assignment.

Reports indicate his sudden decision to resign was President Trump’s announcement that he’d authorized the CIA, an agency that Admiral Holsey doesn’t directly control, to begin covert actions in Venezuela. That rumor is backed up by the fact that announcement came on the same day that Admiral Holsey announced his resignation.

Is Holsey’s departure the beginning of a mass exodus of senior military leaders unwilling to carry out the perceived unlawful orders of the Commander in Chief?

Moochie winner Brad Peniston, editor of *Defense One*, rejoins Mooch to discuss why the Press Corps left their offices in the Pentagon instead of signing an acknowledgment of the new rules put in place by Secretary Hegseth, which is a new condition for retaining their building access badges.

**ENCORE:** As Donald J Trump reassumes the presidency of the United States, General Milley’s experiences as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be considered by all military officers -- but particularly those at the highest levels of the Pentagon. Specifically they should think about what they’re going to do when they get a “lawful but awful” order to carry out. If the campaign rhetoric is accurate, career military officers are going to face a collision of the norms they’ve adopted as the standard over the last four-plus decades with significantly different policies handed down from the incoming Secretary of Defense, whoever that turns out to be.
