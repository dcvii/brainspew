## Abstract

The concept of serrated colorectal neoplasia and a serrated pathway to colorectal cancer (CRC) is relatively new and continuing to evolve, but it has become highly relevant to gastroenterologists, pathologist, and oncologists alike. Sessile serrated adenomas (SSA) are now thought to be the major precursor lesion of serrated pathway cancers, which represent up to one-third of all sporadic CRC cases. However, despite their increasingly recognized importance, relatively little is known about the epidemiology and natural history of SSAs, and the molecular and epigenetic aspects are incompletely understood. Endoscopists must be aware of the unique features of SSAs so that the practice of colonoscopic screening for CRC can include optimized detection, removal, and appropriate surveillance of SSAs and other serrated precursor lesions. In this review, we discuss the history, epidemiology, and pathologic aspects of SSAs, as well as a recommended management approach and a discussion of uncertainties and opportunities for future research.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) kills more than 600,000 people annually worldwide, and is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.

Until recently, adenomatous polyps (now referred to as conventional adenomas) were considered the precursor lesions of all cases of sporadic colon cancer, which was thought to occur via a series of well-defined molecular genetic steps along the chromosomal instability pathway.

Previously, all hyperplastic colorectal polyps were regarded as relatively harmless lesions without malignant potential. It is now recognized that these polyps are in fact a heterogeneous group, now called *serrated polyps*, characterized primarily by a saw-toothed appearance of colonic crypts. This group includes premalignant lesions such as the sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) (also known as the sessile serrated polyp or lesion) and the traditional serrated adenoma (TSA), in addition to the more innocuous hyperplastic polyp (HP).

SSAs are the prototypical precursor lesions of the “serrated pathway” to colorectal cancer (CRC), now understood to have the potential to develop into sporadic CRCs via a series of molecular alterations including BRAF mutation and CpG island methylation, with epigenetic inactivation of the mismatch repair gene MLH1 resulting in microsatellite instability (MSI) ([Figure 1](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig1)).

SSAs are a furtive foe for both the gastroenterologist and pathologist. They tend to be proximally located, have subtle endoscopic features, and are susceptible to being both overlooked and incompletely resected by endoscopists. To complicate matters further, there remains considerable interpathologist variability in the diagnosis of serrated polyp subtypes. These features and their potential to progress may explain (at least in part) why colonoscopy offers less protection from right-sided CRC.

In addition, interval CRCs (ie, those occurring after a previous colonoscopy) frequently are located in the proximal colon and have molecular features of serrated pathway cancers such as CIMP and MSI, suggesting that SSAs contribute to this problem as well ([Figure 2](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig2)).

Figure 2 SSAs likely contribute to the problem of interval (or postcolonoscopy) cancers for 3 chief reasons: (1) SSAs can be difficult to detect during colonoscopy and are commonly missed; (2) it is thought that SSAs have the potential for rapid progression owing to the development of MSI, especially after dysplasia develops; and (3) incomplete polypectomy is common with SSAs. Hollow arrows represent potential targets for combating this problem.

Given their potential public health importance, this review focuses on SSAs, with particular attention to clinical aspects relevant to gastroenterologists. A number of reviews have been published on the pathologic aspects of these lesions,

## History

The understanding of serrated polyps has been evolving over the past 30 years. Originally, all such lesions were classified as HPs, and considered benign, non-neoplastic colorectal polyps, in contrast to adenomatous polyps (ie, conventional adenomas). Occasional reports in the 1970s and 1980s challenged the convention that HPs lacked malignant potential,

to describe a polyp with crypt serration resembling that of HPs, but also with cytologic dysplasia not characteristic of HPs. A number of these serrated adenomas (which would be classified as TSAs using contemporary terminology) had foci of intramucosal carcinoma, establishing a risk of neoplastic transformation, and thus this report served to codify the premalignant potential of some serrated lesions.

This is generally considered the first description of the SSA, although this nomenclature was not generally acknowledged until a 2003 report that described TSAs and SSAs as separate entities.

## Taxonomy and Nomenclature

The World Health Organization (WHO) now recognizes 3 categories of serrated polyps, all characterized by serration of the glandular epithelium: HPs, SSAs, and TSAs ([Supplementary Figure 1](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#app-1)).

There are several subtypes of HPs including the most common microvesicular hyperplastic polyp (MVHP), the goblet cell–rich HP, and the mucin-poor HP ([Supplementary Figure 1](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#app-1)). Although HPs as a group do not directly progress to malignancy, some MVHPs do contain a BRAF <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">V600E</sup> mutation, which disrupts normal apoptosis of epithelial cells.

There remains considerable controversy as to the best name for this lesion ([Table 1](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#tbl1)). Some investigators prefer the term *sessile serrated polyp* to differentiate it from conventional adenomas, whereas other investigators (particularly in Europe) prefer the term *sessile serrated lesion* because SSAs can be nonpolypoid and flat. Although SSA (and TSA) contain the word “adenoma,” it is important to recognize that these lesions are quite distinct from conventional adenomas with respect to histology and molecular biology. Conventional adenomas by definition contain dysplasia, but SSAs typically are nondysplastic.

| Proposed term | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SSA | Term *adenoma* connotes premalignant potential   Term differentiates SSAs from HPs | Creates confusion with conventional adenomas for providers and patients   Some argue that the term *adenoma* should apply only to dysplastic lesions |
| Sessile serrated polyp | Avoids confusion with conventional adenomas   Does not imply dysplasia is present | Some SSAs are flat and nonpolypoid by Paris classification   HPs also are polyps that are sessile and serrated   Fails to convey the premalignant potential of these lesions   May cause problems with insurance coverage for repeat endoscopy |
| Sessile serrated lesion | Avoids confusion with conventional adenomas   Does not imply dysplasia is present   Term is inclusive of nonpolypoid (eg, flat) lesions   Preferred term of some European groups | The term *lesion* does not necessarily imply neoplasia   HPs also are lesions that are sessile and serrated   Fails to convey the premalignant potential of these lesions   May cause problems with insurance coverage for repeat endoscopy |
| SSA/P | Hybrid term of SSA and sessile serrated polyp indicates that both terms apply to same lesion   Most inclusive term | Cumbersome   Cons of both terms apply |
| Serrated adenoma | Congruent with terminology of other premalignant colon polyps (eg, tubular adenomas, villous adenomas) | Nonspecific term could include both SSAs and TSAs   Creates confusion with conventional adenomas for providers and patients   Some argue that the term *adenoma* should apply only to dysplastic lesions   Use of this term is discouraged |
| Serrated polyp with abnormal proliferation | Indicates that lesions have abnormal proliferation even in absence of true dysplasia | Nonspecific term could include both SSAs and TSAs   Cumbersome   Not frequently used |

### Serrated Polyposis Syndrome

Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) (formerly known as *hyperplastic polyposis*) is a condition of multiplicity of serrated polyps. The serrated polyps found in patients with SPS include mainly SSAs, but HPs also often are present, in addition to occasional TSAs.

Therefore, the diagnosis currently is based on meeting somewhat arbitrary clinical criteria. According to the WHO, persons may be diagnosed with SPS if they have the following findings on a single colonoscopic screening examination: (1) at least 5 serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon, 2 of which are greater than 10 mm in diameter; (2) any number of serrated polyps occurring proximal to the sigmoid colon in an individual who has a first-degree relative with serrated polyposis; or (3) more than 20 serrated polyps of any size distributed throughout the colon.

## Histopathology

SSAs are characterized by distorted crypt bases and crypt dilation caused by migration of the proliferative zone to the side of the crypt.

**Sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) vs. traditional serrated adenoma (TSA)**

These features distinguish SSAs from HPs, which have a normal basal proliferative zone and straight (although serrated) crypts ([Figure 1](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig1)).

It is important to note that the dysplasia found in SSAs has different molecular features than the dysplasia seen in conventional adenomas, and hence SSAs with cytologic dysplasia are not simply a combined SSA/tubular adenoma.

whereas the molecular alterations associated with SSAs include BRAF mutation, and CIMP, which can lead to epigenetic silencing of MLH1, a mismatch repair gene, resulting in MSI ([Figure 1](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig1)).

although this is difficult to prove definitively. However, the clinical consequences of specific epigenetic alterations found in SSAs are largely unstudied.

## Epidemiology

The understanding of the epidemiology of SSAs is in evolution. Most studies of the epidemiology of serrated polyps predate the contemporary understanding of serrated neoplasia. The early investigations of HPs are really studies of what we now know to be serrated polyps in general, which may have included some SSAs. Nevertheless, more recent studies have begun to focus on risk factors of significant serrated polyps (eg, large and/or right-sided polyps) and SSAs specifically.

### Prevalence

Approximately 20% to 40% of adults have at least 1 serrated polyp, including distal HPs.

From these series, it is estimated that SSAs represent 1% to 9% of all resected colorectal polyps. Multiplicity of serrated polyps is common. A recent study of more than 1000 patients with serrated polyps (including HPs, SSAs, and TSAs) reported that 44% of patients with serrated polyps had more than 1 serrated polyp, including 21% with 2 serrated polyps, 10% with 3 serrated polyps, 5% with 4 serrated polyps, and 8% with 5 or more serrated polyps.

### Risk Factors

A number of studies have examined the epidemiology and risk factors of HPs as a group, but because small distal HPs represent the majority of serrated polyps, the significance of these findings with respect to SSAs is questionable. Although the risk factors for SSAs and HPs likely overlap to some degree, it is important to understand factors that predispose persons to develop SSAs specifically. As a surrogate for SSAs, some investigators have examined the epidemiology of proximally located or large (typically 1 cm or larger) serrated polyps. Proximal serrated polyps (PSP) have been associated with tobacco use in some studies,

Interestingly, one study reported that women comprised progressively higher proportions of those with more advanced serrated lesions (women represented 53%, 57%, 69%, and 76% of those with nondysplastic SSAs, SSAs with low- and high-grade dysplasia, and SSAs with invasive adenocarcinoma, respectively).

Further research is needed to clarify whether other factors such as race, alcohol intake, other socioeconomic factors, and diet are potentially significant risk factors for the development of SSAs. Identifying predisposing factors for these important CRC precursors is important for prevention and diagnostic efforts.

Recently, a risk score for identifying large, proximal, or dysplastic serrated polyps has been reported.

Bouwens, M.W. ∙ Winkens, B. ∙ Rondagh, E.J....

**Simple clinical risk score identifies patients with serrated polyps in routine practice**

*Cancer Prev Res (Phila).* 2013; **6**:855-863

This risk score was based on associated factors identified in a cross-sectional analysis of individuals undergoing elective colonoscopy at a single Dutch hospital. The identified predictive factors based on multivariate analysis included age older than 50 (odds ratio \[OR\], 2.2; 95% confidence interval \[CI\], 1.3–3.8), history of serrated polyps (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3–4.9), current smoking (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4–3.6), and lack of regular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0). It remains to be seen whether this score will be useful in clinical practice, but it does serve to emphasize that the risk profile for SSAs differs somewhat from that of conventional adenomas (eg, lack of association with male sex), and endoscopists should be especially vigilant for SSAs in certain groups of patients (eg, smokers and those with a history of SSAs).

## Natural History

### Risk of Dysplasia and Progression

The risk and rate of progression of SSAs is not well documented. Some investigators have postulated that SSAs arise from serrated aberrant crypt foci and/or precursor HPs (namely MVHP), but it also is possible that they arise de novo ([Figure 1](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig1)).

### Synchronous Neoplasia

Although the risk of synchronous neoplasia for SSAs specifically has not been well studied, there is some evidence that proximal and large serrated polyps are associated with an increased risk of synchronous advanced neoplasia and cancer.

Further research is needed to better quantify the risk of synchronous and metachronous neoplasia associated with SSAs specifically.

All of these features contribute to a subtle endoscopic appearance, and thus without careful attention from the endoscopist, even large SSAs can escape detection. In 20% to 50% of SSAs, a rim of bubbles or debris is present that can help delineate the lesions and serve as an identification aid.

### Procedural Factors

#### Bowel preparation

It is well established that inadequate bowel preparation negatively impacts adenoma detection, particularly for smaller lesions.

**Impact of colonoscopy preparation quality on detection of suspected colonic neoplasia**

*Gastrointest Endosc.* 2003; **58**:76-79

SSAs are likely even more vulnerable to underdetection in persons with suboptimal preparations. There are multiple reasons for this problem: (1) flat morphology makes SSAs more vulnerable to being obscured by adherent stool and intestinal fluids; (2) SSAs more commonly are located in the right colon, which is more susceptible to imperfect cleansing; and (3) the mucus cap and ring of debris surrounding SSAs often facilitates identification in well-prepared colons, so poor preparations (and water jet irrigation needed to combat them) may eliminate this identification tool. Better bowel preparation is associated with improved detection of flat lesions in general,

However, the effects of bowel preparation on detection of SSAs specifically has not been well studied.

#### Endoscopic technique

Different investigators have reported various techniques to optimize the detection of proximally located polyps including intensive inspection or second looks in the right colon, examination with narrow-band imaging, routine retroflexion in the ascending colon, cap-fitted colonoscopy, and spray chromoendoscopy.

However, data that these techniques improve detection of SSAs specifically are lacking. Nevertheless, it makes intuitive sense that more careful and thorough examination of the right colon will help to optimize SSA detection. In addition, high rates of SSA detection have been reported with high-resolution magnified chromoendoscopy and use of pit-pattern recognition as mentioned earlier.

However, there is significant variability in endoscopists' abilities to accurately identify pit patterns, neither routine chromoendoscopy nor endoscopic magnification is in widespread use currently in the United States, and the cost effectiveness of these techniques in average-risk screening populations is questionable.

Several of these studies reported that SSA (or PSP) detection generally correlated with adenoma detection rates.

**Prevalence and variable detection of proximal colon serrated polyps during screening colonoscopy**

It is clear from these data that when performed skillfully, endoscopy can identify important serrated lesions quite commonly. Distressingly, these data also highlight the fact that some endoscopists do not identify SSAs commonly enough, a situation that likely is fairly pervasive throughout the gastroenterology profession. Individual and practice improvement strategies are needed to reduce this variation and improve the detection and removal of important serrated precursor lesions on an individual and systematic level.

### Detection of Sessile Serrated Adenomas by Other Methods

Although colonoscopy certainly is imperfect, it likely is superior to alternative CRC screening methods for the detection of SSAs. Little has been published in this area, but it is known that computed tomography (CT) colonography has difficulty detecting flat and sessile lesions because of its reliance on morphology, and absence of information on surface characteristics (color, vascular pattern, and so forth).

With respect to fecal occult blood testing and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), serrated polyps are thought to be less likely to hemorrhage than conventional adenomas, so screening tests that rely on the detection of blood are unlikely to be very effective.

The recent development of stool DNA tests for CRC largely have focused on markers based on the traditional adenoma-carcinoma sequence (ie, APC, KRAS), but these tests offer some promise of serrated polyp detection, particularly if methylated or other markers of the serrated pathway are included.

However, there is a paucity of published data on SSA detection with fecal occult blood testing, FIT, and stool DNA panels because, for the most part, serrated lesions have been ignored in CRC screening trials. Therefore, with all of its limitations, colonoscopy likely represents our best chance of addressing and removing serrated pathway precursor lesions such as SSAs.

### Endoscopic Removal

Few published studies have addressed the issue of optimal SSA polypectomy technique. In one recent study, resections of 346 polyps (including 42 SSAs) were examined for completeness using standardized postpolypectomy biopsy specimens from the resected margins.

**Incomplete polyp resection during colonoscopy-results of the complete adenoma resection (CARE) study**

*Gastroenterology.* 2013; **144**:74-80.e1

This study found that 31% of SSAs were resected incompletely, compared with 7% of other polyps. More strikingly, nearly half (48%) of the large SSAs (between 1 and 2 cm) were resected incompletely. This alarmingly high rate of incomplete resection of SSAs highlights the need for extra care when resecting large flat polyps in the right colon to avoid residual polyp tissue. Incomplete resection of polyps is a likely explanation for some interval cancers ([Figure 2](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig2)).

### Pathologic Interpretation

Because serrated neoplasia is a recent concept, pathologic interpretation also is inconsistent. One report from a single academic center with 12 different pathologists reported that the SSA classification prevalence varied from 0% to 4% of patients depending on the pathologist.

Other studies of tandem pathologist readings have shown variable interobserver agreement between pathologists, ranging from poor to good (κ = 0.16–0.66), with a substantial number of polyps read as an SSA by one pathologist, and as an HP by another.

## Proposed Management

Over the past several decades, colonoscopic screening in the United States has been tailored to the detection, removal, and surveillance of conventional adenomas. SSAs have received considerably less attention until recently. The problem of serrated neoplasia and SSAs specifically highlights many of the weaknesses of our current colonoscopy screening approach to CRC prevention ([Figure 4](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig4)). Indeed, there are data that prior colonoscopy offers little or no protection from SSAs, in contrast to advanced adenomas.

99.

**Colorectal endoscopy, advanced adenomas, and sessile serrated polyps: implications for proximal colon cancer**

*Am J Gastroenterol.* 2012; **107**:1213-1219

From a public health standpoint, gastroenterologists must direct their attention to the optimal detection, removal, and appropriate surveillance of SSAs to effectively prevent sporadic CRC. From a patient-care standpoint, endoscopists must be aware of the existence, importance, and identifying features of SSAs to optimize the management of patients harboring these premalignant lesions. Ongoing professional education is important in this regard because this is a burgeoning area of research, and suggested management likely will be in evolution for the foreseeable future. Specific recommendations are provided later.

Figure 4 The issue of serrated neoplasia magnifies many of the flaws of CRC screening programs, and colonoscopy screening specifically. (1) Risk factors for SSAs are poorly understood. Current risk-based screening recommendations (eg, screen between ages 50–75) may not optimize prevention of serrated pathway cancers. (2) SSAs are less likely to be detected by CT colonography (because of flat appearance) or flexible sigmoidoscopy (because of proximal location). Prevention of serrated pathway cancers may be more difficult in individuals who choose noncolonoscopy screening modalities. (3) SSAs have a subtle endoscopic appearance and can be missed during colonoscopy. There is significant variability in endoscopic detection of SSAs. Poor preparation quality (especially in the right colon) may further impair the detection of SSAs. (4) Because of flat/sessile morphology, size, and proximal location, removal of SSAs requires more polypectomy time and skill, and involves more risk. Incomplete resection is common with SSAs. (5) Pathologic understanding of serrated neoplasia is in evolution, with variability in interpretation and terminology used. SSAs may be read as HPs by some pathologists. (6) Surveillance recommendations are based largely on expert opinion and conjecture, not data. Some guidelines do not make specific management recommendations for serrated polyps. (7) Because of issues 3, 4, 5, and 6, individuals harboring SSAs may not undergo surveillance colonoscopy at appropriate intervals. f/u, follow up; prep, preparation.

### Educate Your Patients About Bowel Preparation

As discussed earlier, adequate purgative preparation before colonoscopy is critical to providing high-quality endoscopic screening for adenomas, flat lesions, and (likely) SSAs. There are now good data to support the use of split-dose preparation regimens, which are associated with better patient satisfaction, better colonic cleansing (particularly of the right colon), and improved adenoma and total polyp detection rates.

### Know Your Sessile Serrated Adenoma or Proximal Serrated Polyp Detection Rate

Given the known variation in endoscopic detection of SSAs, endoscopists should be aware of their SSA (or PSP) detection rate. Although there are data that SSA/PSP detection rates and adenoma detection rates are correlated,

### Perform Attentive Colonoscopy

Meticulous colonoscopy technique is needed to optimize SSA detection. In particular, assiduous examination of the right colon is important given that the majority of SSAs are proximally located. The endoscopist must perform careful examination of colonic folds and mucus-covered areas for associated mucosal abnormalities. In our own practice, we recommend that endoscopists learn to retroflex the endoscope and use this technique in the ascending colon to better visualize the backs of folds in the right colon. This practice has been shown to be safe and effective in experienced hands.

When suspicious lesions or mucosal abnormalities are found it is important to accurately record their size and location so that the site can be re-assessed at a later date if needed. The use of narrow-band imaging or chromoendoscopy techniques may facilitate the identification and delineation of SSAs, especially if the endoscopist is trained in pit-pattern recognition.

### Resect Carefully

As with any neoplastic colorectal polyp, complete resection is important to reduce the risk of dysplastic or cancerous tissue left in situ, and to avoid regrowth of neoplastic tissue at the polypectomy site. As discussed earlier, incomplete resection of SSAs, even in experienced hands, is relatively common.

and can be resected safely and effectively at the time of a screening or surveillance colonoscopy. Optimal technique varies depending on the individual characteristics of the SSA. For flat lesions, submucosal injection often is useful to provide a cushion for resection, and to allow for better visualization and seating of the polypectomy snare. Chromoendoscopy and/or including a dye (eg, indigo carmine) in the submucosal injection fluid also can help better define the margins of the polyp and assist complete resection. In light of the data showing an inordinately high incomplete resection rate for SSAs larger than 1 cm, it seems reasonable to tattoo such lesions and repeat an endoscopy in 3 to 6 months to assess the site and remove any residual polyp.

An expanded armamentarium is required for removing SSAs; certain snares may be more effective for removal of these types of polyps including stiffer snares, or spiral or crescent/duckbill-shaped snares.

**Tips for better colonoscopy from two experts**

*Am J Gastroenterol.* 2012; **107**:1467-1472

If the endoscopist is inexperienced in performing endoscopic mucosal resection, or is uncomfortable removing a suspected SSA because of its morphology (eg, flat or laterally spreading), size (eg, >2 cm), or location (behind a fold, abutting the ileocecal valve, and so forth), referral to a colleague or center with appropriate advanced endoscopy expertise in complex polypectomies is recommended.

### Talk With Your Pathologist Colleagues

As discussed earlier, there is known variation in pathologic interpretation of serrated polyps. Before the unique histopathologic features of SSAs were identified, these lesions generally were read by pathologists as HPs. It is likely that some systematic under-reading of SSAs continues to occur today. Gastroenterologists should have a discussion with their pathology colleagues regarding the concept of serrated neoplasia and should partner to discuss cases in which the endoscopic and pathologic determinations differ (eg, a large right-sided sessile polyp with typical endoscopic features of an SSA read as a HP). Providing relevant clinical information, en bloc resections, and properly orientated specimens also helps pathologists to interpret polyps accurately.

**A simple tissue-handling technique performed in the endoscopy suite improves histologic section quality and diagnostic accuracy for serrated polyps**

*Endoscopy.* 2013; **45**:897-905

If this is performed, the pathologist should be able to determine if the margins of the polyp are free of residual neoplasia and that information can aid in follow-up recommendations.

### Be Aware of Surveillance Guidelines

A key question with respect to the management of patients with SSAs pertains to the recommended interval for surveillance colonoscopy. Several investigators and groups have published recommendations on surveillance of individuals with serrated polyps ([Table 2](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#tbl2)). Most recently, the US Multisociety Task Force guidelines for surveillance after colonoscopic polypectomy recommended 1 to 5 years of follow-up evaluation of SSAs, depending on the number and size of lesions found, and the presence or absence of dysplasia.

but it is important to recognize that surveillance recommendations for SSAs likely will be in evolution as our understanding of the behavior and significance of these lesions improves. One area of ambiguity relates to SSAs with dysplasia (SSAD), for which the consensus panel guidelines recommend a 1- to 3-year surveillance interval. Although a 3-year surveillance examination seems appropriate for patients with SSADs if complete resection was achieved, endoscopists should have a low threshold to perform repeat colonoscopy at a short interval (3–6 mo) for assessment of an SSAD polypectomy site when piecemeal resection was performed, or when residual polyp tissue is suspected on the basis of endoscopic appearance or pathology evaluation.

An important consideration is patients with suspected SPS, for whom the recommended surveillance interval is 1 year. It is worth noting that WHO criteria 1 and 3 for SPS (see earlier) are the most common phenotypes,

## Uncertainties and Future Directions

### Pathogenesis

The understanding of serrated neoplasia continues to advance, but many uncertainties remain. Further research is needed in the area of pathogenesis of serrated neoplasia, so the genetic and epigenetic steps along the serrated pathway to CRC (particularly for CIMP-MSS carcinomas) can be better delineated. Discovery of the fundamental cause of CIMP and uniformity in its definition would help clarify this important feature of the serrated pathway. In addition, further study of patients with SPS and its phenotypes and inheritance patterns offers the opportunity to identify the genetic basis of this hereditary syndrome. It is likely that these genes also would be relevant to sporadic serrated neoplasia and SSAs specifically. It also is possible that the current diagnostic criteria for SPS may become meaningless if the rate of recognition of SSAs continues to increase, and/or if more meaningful phenotypic patterns emerge.

### Epidemiology and Natural History

Despite growing recognition of the problem of serrated neoplasia, as described earlier, the epidemiology and natural history of SSAs remain poorly understood. A better understanding of the risk factors for SSAs may help to determine not only which populations have the highest risk of harboring these lesions, but also could help inform studies of pathogenesis. There have been limited longitudinal studies of these lesions, and little is known about the dwell time, features associated with rapid growth or recurrence, and the true prognostic significance of finding SSAs on colonoscopy. As such, the current guidelines for the management of serrated lesions

are based more on expert opinion rather than a substantial evidence base. Additional prospective studies are necessary to better inform clinical decision making and surveillance recommendations. Along those lines, some investigators have recommended randomized trials of SSA polypectomy and surveillance vs watchful waiting or serial biopsies to generate evidence regarding the benefits and harms of different management strategies.

Furthermore, the clinical implications of genetic and epigenetic alterations of SSAs largely are unknown. It is possible that a more comprehensive semimolecular classification of colorectal polyps will help better risk-stratify patients in the future.

### Detection and Resection

Because variable detection (and underdetection specifically) is so pervasive, it seems that initial efforts should be directed at improving endoscopic detection and removal with existing technologies, personnel, and infrastructure. However, because the detection of SSAs is affected disproportionately by the inherent technical limitations of visual inspection with standard white-light colonoscopy, novel or adjunctive approaches may be needed. Several existing endoscopic tools offer the potential to improve SSA detection including magnification chromoendoscopy,

and others also are promising in this regard. However, more research is needed to determine whether these devices and techniques (alone or in combination) are effective, easily learned, practical, and cost effective with respect to improving SSA detection. As mentioned earlier, stool DNA tests do offer some promise of serrated lesion detection, particularly if serrated pathway markers are included. Endomicroscopy, spectroscopy, and molecular imaging also are intriguing developments that potentially could impact SSA detection in the future.

Furthermore, better quantitative estimates of SSA detection by alternative screening methods (eg, FIT, CT colonography, flexible sigmoidoscopy) are needed to fully understand the implications of SSAs for screening guidelines and test selection.

Because resection of SSAs often is inadequate,

**Incomplete polyp resection during colonoscopy-results of the complete adenoma resection (CARE) study**

*Gastroenterology.* 2013; **144**:74-80.e1

further research is needed to optimize complete resection of these lesions to mitigate the risk of polyp regrowth and interval cancers ([Figure 2](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig2)). It is worth noting that the currently available tools for polypectomy (eg, standard oval snares) largely were developed with polypoid adenomas in mind, and other snare shapes and polypectomy tools may need to be appropriated or developed to optimize resection of SSAs and other large and/or flat colonic lesions.

## Conclusions

SSAs represent a new type of combatant in the war against CRC, and it is important for clinicians and researchers to understand their importance. These lesions undoubtedly play a role in interval cancer development ([Figure 2](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig2)). It is clear that unless gastroenterologists direct their attention to the detection, removal, and appropriate surveillance of SSAs, optimal prevention of sporadic CRC will not be possible. The current CRC screening approach also must adapt to address serrated neoplasia ([Figure 4](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)01733-3/#fig4)). Additional research is needed in this area, particularly with regard to pathogenesis, epidemiology, behavior, and endoscopic management of these important CRC precursors.
