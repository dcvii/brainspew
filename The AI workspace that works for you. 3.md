## Prompt Kit: Find the Bottleneck, then Do Something About It

#### How to use this:

Start with the Bottleneck Locator. Everyone does this first.

Based on what it tells you, pick one of three lanes.

Run the experiment. Report back to yourself (or your AI) in writing in 48 hours.

Don’t overthink the inputs. Answer fast. Describe last week, not your ideal job.

Important: These prompts are designed to run even if you paste them without filling anything in. If the assistant starts “reading” you anyway, reply: “Stop. Ask me the questions.”

### Step 1: Bottleneck Locator

Everyone starts here.

Copy the prompt below. If you don’t fill the blanks, the assistant should interview you first. The goal is diagnosis, not performance.

Bottleneck Locator Prompt (paste as-is)

INPUT CHECK (do this first): If any of the five bullets below are empty, vague, or missing, do NOT infer and do NOT produce the final output yet. Ask me up to 5 clarifying questions to fill the blanks. If I answer "not sure," offer 2–3 options and ask me to pick. If I refuse to answer, proceed but label your assumptions as ASSUMPTIONS and ask me to confirm them. CONTEXT: I'm trying to work effectively in a world where execution is cheaper and faster, but my habits and organizational defaults were built for when execution was the bottleneck. I want to identify what's actually constraining me now. MY SITUATION (5 bullets, answer quickly): • Role + what I'm responsible for: \[your answer\] • What I shipped or delivered in the last 2 weeks: \[your answer\] • What's taking most of my time right now: \[your answer\] • What's stuck, slow, or frustrating: \[your answer\] • What I keep doing that feels "responsible" but isn't actually moving things forward: \[your answer\] YOUR TASK (after inputs are real): 1) Identify my primary bottleneck. Choose ONE: - Clarity (I don't know what's worth building or why) - Ambition (I'm playing small when I could swing bigger) - Distribution (I can build it but can't get it to people) - Relationships (I need trust/access I haven't earned yet) 2) Name a secondary bottleneck if present, and explain in one sentence why it's not primary. 3) Tell me what I'm mistakenly protecting instead. Examples: execution capacity, consensus, polish, process, permission, my calendar, someone else's approval. 4) Give me one sentence that reframes my week: "Your job right now is \_\_\_, not \_\_\_." 5) Recommend one of these three lanes and explain why in 2–3 sentences: - Lane 1: Clarity/Ambition — you need a sharper bet and a faster test - Lane 2: Execution Habits — you're blocked by ritual, not ability - Lane 3: Distribution/Relationships — building isn't your constraint, reaching people is 6) Give me one "safe experiment" I can run in 48 hours that is low-risk and reversible. OUTPUT FORMAT: • Primary bottleneck: • Secondary bottleneck (if any): • What I'm over-protecting: • Reframe: • Recommended lane (1, 2, or 3): • 48-hour experiment:

### Step 2: Choose Your Lane

Based on what the Locator told you, pick the prompt that fits.

#### Lane 1 — Clarity or Ambition

You don’t need more meetings. You need a sharper bet and a faster test.

Use this if you’re stuck on what to build, unsure if the direction is right, or playing it safe when you could be swinging bigger. The goal is to turn a vague idea into something testable in 48 hours.

Prototype-as-Spec Prompt

INPUT CHECK (do this first): If any fields below are empty, vague, or missing, do NOT infer and do NOT produce the final output yet. Ask me up to 5 clarifying questions to fill the blanks. If I answer "not sure," offer 2–3 options and ask me to pick. If I refuse to answer, proceed but label your assumptions as ASSUMPTIONS and ask me to confirm them. CONTEXT: I have an idea I've been circling but haven't committed to. I want to stop planning and start testing. Help me turn this into a prototype I can build fast—and help me know when to kill it. MY IDEA: • What I'm considering building or changing (one sentence): \[your answer\] • Who it's for: \[your answer\] • What problem it solves (plain language, no jargon): \[your answer\] • What would make this not worth doing: \[your answer\] YOUR TASK (after inputs are real): 1) Rewrite this into a "prototype-as-spec": - 8 bullet lines maximum - Each bullet ≤ 12 words - No preamble, no justification - Include what's out of scope 2) Define my signals (48–72 hours): • Success signal: a behavior, response, metric, or reaction • Kill signal: what would tell me to stop and try something else 3) Give me a 48-hour build plan. Assume I have AI assistance and can move fast: - what to build first - what to skip - the minimum version that lets me learn 4) Write the message I send after I've built it: Format: "I tried X—here's what happened." Make it something I can send to my manager, team, or stakeholder that shows momentum without asking permission. 5) Bonus: If this idea is too small, tell me. Suggest the bigger version I'm avoiding. OUTPUT FORMAT: • Prototype-as-spec (8 bullets max): • Success signal: • Kill signal: • 48-hour plan: • "I tried X" message: • (If applicable) The bigger swing:

#### Lane 2 — Execution Habits

You’re not blocked by ability. You’re blocked by ritual.

Use this if you’re stuck in permission loops, waiting on approvals, over-polishing, sitting in meetings that don’t resolve anything, or asking for consensus you don’t actually need. The goal is to break one ritual this week and see what happens.

Safety constraint: Don’t run experiments that touch legal/compliance/security/finance approvals, production systems, customer data, or public brand/comms without actual permission. This lane is for breaking unnecessary rituals, not necessary ones.

One-Day Default Prompt

INPUT CHECK (do this first): If any fields below are empty, vague, or missing, do NOT infer and do NOT produce the final output yet. Ask me up to 5 clarifying questions to fill the blanks. If I answer "not sure," offer 2–3 options and ask me to pick. If I refuse to answer, proceed but label your assumptions as ASSUMPTIONS and ask me to confirm them. CONTEXT: I have something I want to do, but I'm waiting—for permission, feedback, alignment, approval, or the "right moment." I want to figure out if this wait is necessary or if I'm just running an old habit. MY SITUATION: • The thing I'm waiting on or asking permission for: \[your answer\] • Why I think I need permission/approval (be honest): \[your answer\] • Worst-case downside if I do it and it flops (be realistic, not catastrophic): \[your answer\] • How reversible is it? (high / medium / low): \[your answer\] • Time to build a rough version (in hours, not days): \[your answer\] YOUR TASK (after inputs are real): 1) Apply the One-Day Default rule: If it can be finished in a day AND the downside is reversible, I should build first and show results—not ask first and wait. Tell me clearly: Does this qualify? Yes or no, with a one-sentence explanation. 2) If yes, give me a build-first plan (3–6 concrete steps). Assume I have AI assistance. Be specific about what I build, in what order, and what I skip. 3) Write two messages for me: PROVISIONAL DECISION MESSAGE (send before or while building): "I'm going ahead with \[X\] unless I hear otherwise by \[time\]. Here's what I'm trying to learn: \[Y\]. I'll share what happens." RESULTS MESSAGE (send after): "I built \[X\]—here's what happened. \[One sentence on what I learned.\] Next step I'm considering: \[Z\]. Thoughts?" 4) Give me a rollback plan. Make the reversal explicit so it feels safe to move fast. 5) If this actually requires permission (high stakes, irreversible, political), tell me. But be honest about whether I'm using "requires permission" as cover for avoiding judgment. OUTPUT FORMAT: • Qualifies for One-Day Default? (yes/no + why): • Build-first plan: • Provisional decision message: • Results message: • Rollback plan: • (If applicable) Why this actually needs permission:

#### Lane 3 — Distribution or Relationships

You can build. But building isn’t the constraint. Reaching people and earning trust is.

Use this if you’ve already built something (or could build it fast) but it’s not getting adopted, not reaching the right people, or not landing because you don’t have the relationships or credibility yet. The goal is to run a 2-week sprint focused on reach and trust, not features.

Reach + Trust Sprint Prompt

INPUT CHECK (do this first): If any fields below are empty, vague, or missing, do NOT infer and do NOT produce the final output yet. Ask me up to 5 clarifying questions to fill the blanks. If I answer "not sure," offer 2–3 options and ask me to pick. If I refuse to answer, proceed but label your assumptions as ASSUMPTIONS and ask me to confirm them. CONTEXT: I have something that works (or could work), but it's not getting traction. The problem isn't building—it's reaching the people who need it and earning enough trust that they'll actually use it. I want to run a focused 2-week sprint on distribution and relationships. MY SITUATION: • What I'm trying to get adopted (product, process, idea, or offering): \[your answer\] • Who has to say yes for it to matter (specific roles or people): \[your answer\] • What channel I currently rely on, if any (cold outreach, word of mouth, content, partnerships, internal advocacy): \[your answer\] • Why I think people don't adopt it today (be honest—awareness, trust, friction, timing, something else): \[your answer\] YOUR TASK (after inputs are real): 1) Pick one distribution wedge for me to focus on (best fit): - Partner - Platform - Internal champion - Community - Enterprise channel - Content Explain why this wedge in 2–3 sentences. 2) Give me a 2-week sprint plan with: • 10 targets: specific people, partners, or accounts to reach out to. If I can't name people, give me: - 10 target categories (titles, communities, org types) - a method to find 3 names for each category • 3 "easy yes" asks: low-commitment requests that move things forward • 1 proof artifact to ship this week: demo, walkthrough, case study, teardown, or comparison 3) Define my trust deposits for the next 14 days: 3–5 behaviors that compound reliability (follow-through, usefulness, responsiveness, etc.) 4) Write my outreach message: • Under 100 words • Not desperate or salesy • Specific, low-friction ask • Reason to care that’s about them, not me 5) Tell me what I should stop doing during this sprint: What building activities should I pause to make room for distribution? OUTPUT FORMAT: • Distribution wedge + why: • 10 targets: • 3 easy-yes asks: • Proof artifact to ship this week: • Trust deposits (3–5 behaviors): • Outreach message: • What to stop doing:

### After 48 Hours (or 2 Weeks)

Come back. Run the Bottleneck Locator again. See if the constraint moved.

If you’re still stuck on the same thing, go deeper in the same lane.

If the bottleneck shifted, pick a new lane.

The goal isn’t to optimize once. It’s to keep recalibrating as the ground moves.
