### Why don't they teach these in college?

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucst!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2337ea28-1810-40ca-a9a6-6b372d4a8a63_1057x352.png)

You want to hear a horror story? Forget vampires and werewolves. Instead talk to a young person about their job search. That’s scarier than a month of Halloweens.

A college degree is no better than a lottery ticket. A *very expensive* lottery ticket with long odds stack against you. Even so-called marketable degrees won’t go to the market, and stay home like that unemployed piggy.

Where did all the jobs go? Is AI already replacing entry level openings? Did you study STEM just to get replaced by SLOP?

Listen to the sad young people:

- “I just checked my bank account and found I only have $100 left. Honestly, my hands are shaking as I write this. I’ve sent over 400 applications….My hope is running out.” ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearch/comments/1ps8m5w/i_just_checked_my_bank_account_and_found_i_only/))
- “I’ve been mass applying to literally everything and I can’t even get first round interviews….The shame I feel is unreal. I didn’t expect it to be this difficult. I don’t know what to do. Please help me.” ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1oij3cw/i_cant_find_a_job_and_its_making_me_feel_worthless/))
- “I put in 100 applications a day to jobs I am overqualified for!! I still never get an interview or call back! I don’t understand the job market….I’ve been staying with my parents because I haven’t been able to land a job that pays enough for me to live on my own! I’m starting to just give up on life.” ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kvpyl3/why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_a_job_now/))
- “It's been 5 months and I’m still unemployed as I can't find a job anywhere with hundreds of interviews and every manager saying they don't need employees. If this continues I will be homeless. I am poor and broke as of now.” ([Source](https://x.com/Yajdan6/status/2015801963401646099))

I could share hundreds of stories like this. And even a degree from a high status institution doesn’t guarantee success. Some [23% of Harvard Business School graduates are still unemployed three months after getting their degree](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/latest-studies/story/23-harvard-mbas-jobless-stanford-wharton-ivy-league-similar-trend-unemployment-problems-2670884-2025-01-27). Back in 2022, that number was just 10%.

It’s no better at Stanford, [according to the](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-19/they-graduated-from-stanford-due-to-ai-they-cant-find-job) *[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-19/they-graduated-from-stanford-due-to-ai-they-cant-find-job):*

> Stanford computer science graduates are discovering their degrees no longer guarantee jobs as AI coding tools now outpace entry-level programmers. Tech companies are replacing 10 junior developers with just two experienced engineers and an AI agent capable of equivalent productivity.

This problem isn’t going away. Our tech leaders are actually boasting about their ability to destroy jobs—they’re proud of it.

So what do you do? What are the job skills that will help you survive in an age of AI?

Trust me, they exist. In fact, some skills will be more valuable when the bots take control.

By my reckoning, these ten skills will do just that. It’s too bad that they don’t teach any of them in school.

### Contrarian Thinking

Do you notice that everything AI produces feels stale? That should be expected—AI has been trained to regurgitate the consensus of the past. It’s built on statistical and probabilistic metrics that keep it trapped in conventional thinking.

You can’t train a rule-driven system on the past and expect it to produce the future. Instead you will get groupthink on steroids.

If you want something fresh and new, you need contrarian thinking. You need people who can see the blind spot in the consensus. You need people who have learned how to swim against the current.

These skills can be taught and nurtured. There are books that teach contrary thinking. There are case studies that show how it works. But they’re not part of education today because college has also gotten captured by conformity and groupthink.

I plan to write more about this subject in the future. But now let’s move on to the second skill that becomes more valuable in an age of bots.

### Empathy

AI bots are filled with fake emotion. They use feeling words, even though they lack those very feelings. They are demonstrably sycophantic—prone to what a saltier person than me would describe as *ass-kissing*.

You can’t spend more than a few minutes with a chatbot without feeling how inauthentic its response are.

This is creating a massive shortage in empathy in today’s society. If you could measure it, it would be as big as the national debt. So if you can be a real person and connect with others with real feelings, you will be in demand—and no large language model can replace you.

### Hands-on skills

Can AI fix a leak in my plumbing? Can it trim the trees in my yard? Can it replace my stovetop? Can it tune my piano?

No, it can’t.

I have to pay actual people to do this—and they are in short supply. As I write this, my stovetop isn’t working, and I put in a repair request 21 days ago—the (highly paid) repair guy keeps telling me: *I’ll get back to you soon*. But he doesn’t. He has too many other clients.

There are a thousand hands-on skills like this. Learn a few of them, and you will never be out of work.

### Reading the room

AI has truly been created in the image of its makers. People like Musk, Thiel, Altman, Zuckerberg may be smart, but their people skills are abysmal. They just can’t read the room.

And now they have unleashed AI bots on us that are similarly clueless. It’s almost laughable how badly the bots fail to detect nuance and tone in their interactions with people.

People who have the necessary soft skills—understanding body language, tone of voice, gestures, facial expressions—will be essential to the smooth functioning of society.

### Moral compass

AI can talk about right and wrong, but it lacks a conscience. It can talk about ethics and moral values, but doesn’t possess them.

If you can give your word and keep your promises, you already have an edge over the machines. If people can trust you to do the right thing, you will always have a job.

So nurture your moral compass. It is the foundation of everything—and not just in the workplace.

### Listening

AI doesn’t listen. It merely responds to prompts. And it does it in the most disinterested way imaginable—although it has been taught to pretend otherwise.

But people aren’t much better. Even the professionals who should be listening—doctors, lawyers, ministers, educators—can’t be counted on to hear what you have to say. Even rarer are people who not only hear, but probe to discover what’s behind the words you say, and find the truths you struggle to express.

In a tech-driven world, this listening deficit will get worse and worse. I’m not surprised that some of the fastest-growing job categories include many (nurse practitioners, home health care, aides to the elderly, etc.) where listening skills are paramount.

### Leadership

Teachers aren’t just worried about AI due to rampant cheating, but also because students are losing independent thinking skills. They put more trust in the bot than in their own abilities. And this erodes confidence, judgment, and decision-making.

People who keep going down this path lose all ability to lead—they simply follow. But leadership skills are becoming more essential than ever in this sheep-like society. And, here too, this is more than a workplace issue. Leadership skills are necessary in schools, communities, churches, athletics, households, and even the lemonade stand on the corner.

These skills can be taught. College education was originally focused on them. [As Jennifer Frey reminds us](https://thepointmag.substack.com/p/can-the-humanities-be-saved):

> \[They\] were very intentionally established to be about what the Germans would call *Bildung*, or what the Greeks would call *paideia* —they were about the formation of leaders. The course of study was “liberal” in the sense that it wasn’t for the sake of some specific trade or line of work, but it was really about forming you into a free person and citizen.

How do you nurture leadership skills today? One of the best starting points is the next item on my list….

### Agency

Learn how to fix things without waiting for permission or consulting the bureaucracy. This requires an attitude of agency—a willingness to take responsibility for the situation at hand.

That’s why the US was able to defeat Germany in World War II. The German troops waited for orders, but American soldiers would figure out solutions on their own. That’s the difference between an adaptive society and an algorithmic one. We lose this skill at great risk.

### Humility

The chatbots often say the stupidest things—for example, [telling people to put glue on pizza or eat rocks](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o) —but they always do so with total confidence. The arrogance is off the charts, and [sadly unjustified by the actual results produced](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/).

One of first signs that you are dealing with a competent human, and not a bot, is an appropriate level of humility—a willingness to admit the limits of knowledge or experience. This is always the flip side of competence. You only achieve competence (or, even better, excellence) by knowing and gradually testing the boundaries of your skill set.

In a world where bots keep giving bad answers with total self-assurance and claim skills they lack, this wise humility will be more valuable than ever.

### Speaking truth to power

The rise of the technocracy has given enormous power to a tiny number of billionaires. And they increasingly operate without checks or balances, pursuing ends for their own benefit, not the common good.

We see a similar aggregation of power in political systems, where even leaders in democracies seem hell-bent on putting people who disagree with them in jail. This creates further polarization, and hence even more repression.

Advances in tech make this malevolent surveillance and social control easy to implement, and hard to stop. But who is brave enough to speak up against the overseers in this Orwellian scenario?

The situation feels ominous. But I’ve noticed that people who do speak truth to power have an electrifying effect on those around them. One brave soul can stir up dozens of others—or, in some instances, millions of others.

We always need these bold truth-tellers. But in a world where people are disempowered by AI and other systems of technocratic control, we simply can’t survive without them.

So nurture this truth-telling instinct in yourself, and support it in others. You can’t expect the bots to do it—for the simple reason that they were built to service the technocracy. Any challenge to that system can only come from the people themselves.
