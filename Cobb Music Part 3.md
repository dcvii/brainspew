### Jobs vs DRM

Steve Jobs has now said what all of us knew a long time ago. DRM is never going to work. And while I've always been a fan of Liquid Audio's watermarking way back since Webnoise 99, I never supported copy protection. [Thus sayeth Jobs](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/):

> Why would the big four music companies agree to let Apple and others distribute their music without using DRM systems to protect it? The simplest answer is because DRMs haven’t worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy. Though the big four music companies require that all their music sold online be protected with DRMs, these same music companies continue to sell billions of CDs a year which contain completely unprotected music. That’s right! No DRM system was ever developed for the CD, so all the music distributed on CDs can be easily uploaded to the Internet, then (illegally) downloaded and played on any computer or player.
> 
> In 2006, under 2 billion DRM-protected songs were sold worldwide by online stores, while over 20 billion songs were sold completely DRM-free and unprotected on CDs by the music companies themselves. The music companies sell the vast majority of their music DRM-free, and show no signs of changing this behavior, since the overwhelming majority of their revenues depend on selling CDs which must play in CD players that support no DRM system.
> 
> So if the music companies are selling over 90 percent of their music DRM-free, what benefits do they get from selling the remaining small percentage of their music encumbered with a DRM system? There appear to be none. If anything, the technical expertise and overhead required to create, operate and update a DRM system has limited the number of participants selling DRM protected music. If such requirements were removed, the music industry might experience an influx of new companies willing to invest in innovative new stores and players. This can only be seen as a positive by the music companies.

Now the record companies have to wake up to the reality of five years of empirical proof of digital music distribution, now strikingly illustrated by iTunes and face the facts brought to light by Steve Jobs. Furthermore Jobs has to face the facts about the limits that iPod only syncing has provided to limit the ubiquity of iTunes and vice-versa.

The bottom line is that DRM is a royal pain for consumers, especially given the weakness of hard disk technology as a medium for storing digital music. We love songs for decades. Hard drives work for 2 years. We have to keep moving our music all the time and any veteran will tell you that the best way to keep it is on a laser medium. Until the is reality, this will continue to be a problem.

### What's Spinning Now

I haven't written anything about music on this blog in a long time. I'm in a strange kind of transitional period.

**Isley Brothers**  
On the one hand, I have discovered a kind of personal nirvana in playing the bassline for 'For The Love of You' which I learned two weeks ago. I can literally sit for an hour and play the song over and over again until I'm in a kind of trance. The same is true with 'Atlantis'. I've done this both weekends I've been home from Arizona and it's almost not fair to my family. The groove is that deep. This is where I've been musically.

**KBAQ**  
I have listened to nothing but classical music in my renta-car for the past two weeks. In all of that, I've only heard one new piece that makes me hunger for more. It was Stravinsky's rendition (I think) of the Eroica Trio. The rest of it has mostly been oddments and sleepy-time music with an occasional robust Copeland thrown in. I know there's got to be some Prokofiev or something I need to hear, but in all these hours I haven't heard it.

**Paul Schwartz**  
Through the late summer I've been grooving with Paul Schwartz. Nothing new here, just more of the mellow same.

**Frank McComb**  
Frank has three albums out that I haven't heard, two of which I didn't know existed. The first is The 1995 Bootleg. I listened to every sample available on the iTunes Music Store, and I'm going to get it first chance I get. The others are The Truth and The Truth Volume 2. Very soon, I'll be knee deep in McComb. Oh and get this, he does a cover of Stevie Wonder's 'Golden Lady'. Gotta have it.

**Negro Opera**  
I've still been lax in finding that Negro Opera I've been hungry after. I may end up just hovering over Leontine Price or even Paul Robeson. We'll see.

**Korn**  
I heard some unmistakable Korn the other day on the freeway. Or maybe it was somebody's cell phone. These things conspire to remind me that I haven't heard any good rock in a while.

**Radiodread**  
Finally, the last good set of tunes I purchased was a custom CD from Hear Music. Wow, that was before Thanksgiving. It contained several tracks from a reggae band that did covers of Radiohead. Awesome stuff. Next I've got to get their Pink Floyd. The group is called the Easy Star All-Stars. Very much worth it. Check 'em out.

Oh yeah, and I've got Craig Mack on the brain this morning. I need a cure for that.

### Negro Classical Recovery

Every once in a while I get a bug to go and discover something I sorta know but don't. I call this periodic effort a recovery. Ever since the death of McFerrin Sr came to my attention I've gotten an achy feeling that I need to hear more classical negro spirituals.

But my hunger is for something very specific that I cannot quite describe. It has to be vocal, vocal, vocal. I have, through Paul Schwartz become very enamored of operatic music. It is something that was perhaps inevitable, but now the fever has hit me. As I write this, I am listening to Marian Anderson streaming [at her website](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.mariananderson.org/site.htm). The dynamic range of her voice is stunning. [Hall Johnson](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_Johnson) is next.

### Christian Scott: Rewind That

My sister for which I have no nickname dropped by back from Detroit. She had to bus it to Denver because of the snowstorm last week and is very glad to be back in the sun. Into my hands plopped Christian Scott.

I have no idea what's going on in Jazz, you know. Basically there are four poles. They are Kenny G, and his ilk. There's what the old heads like Herbie, Chick and Sonny are doing. There's the more disciplined of the new wave - the guys that tweak the rhythm and chords for better or worse - Don Cherry, Henry Threadgill, Cecil Taylor. Finally there are those artists who are playing in the shadow of Miles' Tutu and Amandla.

Latest into that shadow is Christian Scott. And heaven help me I believe that perhaps I have been missing something. I would call this the New Straight Jazz. It's not overdone like the daunting and often unfun complex virtuosity of Steve Coleman. It's not personality driven like all of the Straight pretenders like Boney James. It's not majestic and serious like Wynton's stuff. And it's not obnoxiously clever like so much of new Jazz. This guy runs a band, and he does it with all the style & energy of Lenny White.

Scott is not all bounce though. He's got a beautiful pacing and tone. For the most part he sounds like a little less sharp Wayne Shorter on Speak No Evil. And nicely he doesn't shy away from moods. I gotta say I'm going to be rolling with this for a while. Excellent work, and a great recording. Oh and let me remind you that this is the best cover of 'So What' that I've ever heard. Just the right amount of backbeat.

### James Brown: You Hear Me?

*I'm such a lover of people because people did so much for me. I'm a lover of all humanity of all mankind. And I feel that he that he who has been successful should look out for his fellow man, his brother. I feel that's my role, that's my job.* -- James Brown

I heard an NPR interview with James Brown a couple years ago when he was making what appeared to be his fifth or sixth 'comeback'. He impressed me as one of the last Americans who was able to sell his genius without formalism.

Listening to him speak I realized at once that he was illiterate in a literal sense - unable to articulate his own meaning outside of his gift. He spoke of music in abstracts inappreciable to non-adepts. I got the feeling just listening to him that he was completely original in every way and you could tell that there was something deep in him that he never had to change for anyone. He was a self-actualized man in ways that just captivated everyone, because society tells us that such men don't exist. If the man wrote in hyroglyphics or described colors to sightless people it wouldn't surprise me a bit. James had something of an alien mind, his musical creation and his creation of himself into the hardest working man in show business was a kind of inevitability. I think of him as a giant pearl with some incredibly strange, dense and oddly shaped object as its center of gravity. You could never predict how he would roll, but whenever he did it was a rhythmic glowing miracle. All you can do is stare.  

They called him the Godfather of Soul. James Brown was more like the Wormhole of Rhythm. Nothing could get close to him without being sucked into his powerful grooves. He punctuates his music with an energy that resists passive listening. You can't just appreciate James Brown music. You have to decide to either get into the groove or get out of the room. There are three transcendent elements to James Brown. The groove, the bridge and the break. Now I'm going to be like James and not even going to try to describe them. They are what they are. You just have to listen to the man.  

My favorite James Brown song? That would have to be Hot Pants. It's the one that connected with me on the subconscious level. Like voodoo on the adolescent mind when I danced and mouthed the lyrics to Hot Pants, something wrestled my limbic system to the ground and shook it around. Aww and that was dangerous.  

I can recall ministers in the Foursquare Gospel Church preaching against and in synch with James Brown. I can still remember the 'Get On the Good Foot With Jesus' sermon from my childhood. In fact I can remember my minister waffling on 'Say It Loud' on several occasions. What could he do? How could any natural man resist what James was throwing down? He was too powerful, too truthful, to artful to ignore. He would just get out there and dance and sweat and destroy all pretenders. James Brown was more than just a King, he was a King in Action. He acted on the mind and body in ways that every preacher from every pulpit wished he could. James Brown had a grip on your soul.

I think some people like James Brown's 'I Feel Good' it's because it's one of his lightest songs. You can can hum along to that one and not break out in a funky sweat. 'I Feel Good' lets you off the hook with its hook. Any dainty milquetoast can feel nice like sugar and spice. But try that with 'Payback'. Nah brudda. James Brown is more than a little bit profound.

James Brown's greatest song? I would have to say that would be 'Get It Together'. It exemplifies every one of his strengths as an inventive band leader, a lyricist, an arranger and just a kick ass performer. 'Get It Together' is the master groove. The song just goes on and on and you can hear. You cannot understand a groove without going back to James Brown on this song. It is the definitive archtype of funk. Now I know there are those who would say that 'Cold Sweat' defines the break, and it's hard to argue with that. After the break he takes you to the bridge and doesn't come back to the groove. It's an amazing effect that keeps your attention, but I still have to give it to 'Get It Together'.

So much of what we're fussing about over Kwanzaa is directly related to what James was singing about in 'Say It Loud'. I was one of those kids. I too would rather die on my feet than live on my knees. Thanks James, you are a hero for the ages.

### Lonely

The name of the song is 'Lonely'. We basically put it together tonight. This is the third take of the song we just spontaneously invented on the spot, and it's the first really coherent piece we've composed. It feels like a song. We don't have our signals down, so when I said 'break it down' - he didn't stop for a drum and bass solo but it worked out great, I think. I kept thinking about what Monk was saying in Straight No Chaser about getting your first reaction to the music on tape and living with the consequences if you mess up. So basically since there wasn't any written music and the whole thing was improvised from the jump, I think we did a pretty decent job.

It won't be long before Boy is going to far outstrip my abilities. In fact, I'm just hoping I can keep up with the Christmas caroles we're going to be recording in the next few weeks. So welcome to our little jam sessions.

### Top Crossover Rock Hits

We all know about the black groups that has crossover appeal to white audiences during the 70s. You know, Lionel Ritchie, Stevie Wonder, Earth Wind & Fire.. What about the white groups that had crossover appeal over to black audiences?

This is going to be hard but I'm going to try it, a semi-scientific aggregation of the top 70s crossover & rock songs that did well in the 'hood. I'm going back into my memory banks and digging up what I remember from highschool that appealed to brothers back in the day and I'm ranking them on three scales.

1\. How generally alien they were to R&B and funk.  
2\. How much I gauge that I (and other brothers liked them)  
3\. How broad was that liking.

For example. Take Aerosmith's 'Walk This Way'. On the alien scale, that scores high. It ain't a white group trying to be funky, that's a straight out rock anthem. On the excitement scale, it was pretty high. If you liked it, you really liked it, and brothers who liked it really did. On the broad scale it scores low. Brothers did not admit that they liked it openly and black radio didn't really play it.

So let's take some nominations. I'll publish a spreadsheet with the results on Thursday. On a scale of 1-5, 5 being most, give me your guesses. Song, Artist, Year (if you can), Alien, Excitement, Broad.

Here's my guess. The top groups are going to be The Eagles, Journey, Toto, Foreigner, Pat Benatar and Rod Stewart. In the second tier will be Steely Dan, Chicago, Doobie Brothers, ELO, Fleetwood Mac, and ACDC. Then in the third tier, Aerosmith, Foghat, Gino Vanelli, Boz Scaggs, Hall & Oates, J Geils, David Bowie, Elton John.. At least that will give you something to think of. Fire away.

### Equivocal Love for Hiphop

It's easy to hate what hiphop has become. It's difficult to hate hiphop music. For me, the question is whether or not what pumps out of trucks these days can be called music. It's as if the wheel has turned and now experienced blackfolks are saying the same things inexeperienced whitefolks were saying 20 years ago. That's not music!

It is music of course, and you can't even really say that it's bad music. There is so much hiphop out there today that even the garbage they play on the radio evidences talent of a recognizable sort. The product has been refined and purified. Commercial hiphop is musical crack. Producing it is not rocket science but it is chemistry.  

But people with memories of the hiphop of the 80s and early 90s remember is when hiphop was social, political and musical manna. When Miles Davis made a hiphop album, it was a different world. This won't be the first, nor will it be the last time I comment on hiphop, but until it changes substantially, I think I know categorically what is wrong with it, and that wrongness is unlikely to change. It is the impoverished emotional range of hiphop today that makes it alien to those who once loved and lived it.

As usual at Cobb, I think of taxonomies. And because it was my generation that was responsible for investing so much into hiphop, these taxonomies are deeply intertwined with black identity. So I must speak of these in terms of black people and all of black music. Black music is Hiphop, Gospel, Blues, Funk, Reggae, Jazz and R&B. Seven nice round categories. Each of those expresses a different set of values best. The tragedy of hiphop is that while it has the potential to sample expressions of all because of its open structure, that it has been reduced to the narrow emotional spectrum of lust, greed, anger and frustration. Now one can split hairs and say that is really the fault of rap lyrics; that hiphop music can express a broad range of emotion instrumentally. My response is that jazz musicians and R&B artists have appropriated all that. I would allow one other exception to the completeness of this taxonomy and it is an important one, and that is the emotions of dance music. When Missy Elliot cranks out one of her jams, she has got the groove nailed and the infectious beat. I'm going to call that Funk, not Hiphop. And in that realm, I'll gladly admit things get complicated for me.

People like me who [hate what hiphop has become](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/05/who_hates_hipho.html), do so because of the cramp it has put on its dynamic emotional range. We invested so much of ourselves to it and in the end it grew into a monster, and so we had to let it go and disclaim it. Yet there stand many sentinels, diehard lovers of hiphop who with age have begun to equivocate their love for it. They speak of hiphop as a woman, a goddess, for whom they once gave their all, and she betrayed them and became a cheap, dirty whore. And now they long for the beauty of yesterday while she still enhances her attractiveness and flashes of her beauty remain as brilliant as ever. To have truly loved the art of hiphop is to have endured the worst sort of heartache, better to have loved and lost the hiphop struggle than to not have loved at all.

[Lonnae Parker writes in today's Washington Post:](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/13/AR2006101301426_pf.html)

> We felt ourselves united, with the power of a language we didn't begin to understand. "Rap at its best can refashion the world -- or at least the way we see it -- and shape it in our own image," said Adam Bradley, a literature professor at Claremont McKenna College who is working on a book about hip-hop poetics. It has the capacity "to give a voice that's distinctively our own and to do it with the kind of confidence and force we might not otherwise have."

> I learned all the rhymes played on black radio, because do you remember when MTV wouldn't touch black music at all? I got to college and started getting my beats underground, which is where I stayed to find my hip-hop treasures. Public Enemy rapped "Fight the Power" and it could have been the soundtrack to CNN footage of Tiananmen Square or the fall of the Berlin Wall:
> 
> *Got to give us what we want  
> Gotta give us what we need  
> Our freedom of speech is freedom or death  
> We got to fight the powers that be.*
> 
> I was young and hungry and hip-hop was smart, and like Neneh Cherry said, we were raw like sushi back then, sensing we were onto something big, not realizing how easily it could get away from us.

Gospel remains the music of inspiration and devotion. But there are things that even young people's tastes make pefectly clear (if I'm a competent judge) and that is Old School romantic R&B still counts. Funk remains the basis of the hottest dance music, especially electric funk. And there are not enough days remaining in my life to adequately describe Jazz and the Blues. But I would stop to bow my head against the pinpricks of shame any growup blackfolks feel in regards to the most popular hiphopification of a blues song, Golddigger by Kanye West.

But there are times when I like hiphop for being exactly what it is, raw, stupid, loud, arrogant, angry rebellious noise. More often than not, I like that [musically without listening to the words](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/05/the_nonguilty_p.html), which can be like a bad sermon in a beautiful church. There is something to say about music that conveys this belligerent spectrum of human emotion. I predict that one of these days, the most awesome and shocking martial music ever is going to be a hiphop anthem. If you listen to [American military cadences](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/06/gimme_that_anch.html) you can hear African chants, and that call and response deep in black American music. We're only a step away from going way beyond what Country has done in righteous anger over attacks we've suffered and hiphop could be a transcendant vehicle, but..

But hiphop culture is a fragment of youth culture and America suffers from a youth culture that is dysfunctional in any nmber of directions. That is primarily because we have the nerve to call what youth do 'culture', but secondarily because the dumbing down of American culture that is youth culture has been commercialized successfully. What sells well is considered good. Sex and violence sells well. And part of the dysfunction that masquerades as blackness today manifests sex and violence in hiphop as lust and anger. Hiphop perverts any romantic or chivalrous code that might be vehicles for the full spectrum of emotions around sex and violence. They are common denominators, but hiphop brings them uncommonly low.

I don't feel compelled to denigrate hiphop. It does an excellent job of self-destruction. Nor do I feel any desire to reclaim it as I once did before I had a family. But it's clear that the genre could use a lot of work. There is no King of Hiphop who might direct it to a better place, as far as I know there are no critical awards other than Grammys. Hiphop improvisationally defies those definitions that might put it's tradition of sucka MC self-criticism on a philosophically consistent track. What was once 'dope' now must be 'crunktastic'. The opacity of hiphop crit is inside baseball to the nth degree. It's always crypto- something. Just try reading Byron Crawford (aka [Bol Gueverra)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.byroncrawford.com/) sometime. You know something mysteriously wrong is going on when you have a category like ' [Least Tragic Hip Hop Deaths](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.byroncrawford.com/2006/02/least_tragic_hi.html) '.

As a conservative, I'm more likely to find new undiscovered classics in other genres than wait for a Hiphop renaissence. That's ok. It doesn't concern me as a black man because there are five other flavors of black music. Our generation was wrong in rebelling against Peaches and Herb, and expecting as much from Salt & Pepa. But now that we're older and wiser, we can look to all the other forms of black music and be reunited. And it feels so good.

### Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time?

**Thom Bell** outclasses Terri Gross in an [NPR Interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6181419). It's about time this man gets his props.

> Producer, composer and arranger Thom Bell was one of the prime originators of the Sound of Philadelphia, creating hits with the Delfonics such as "La La La Means I Love You" and "Didn't I Blow Your Mind." Bell was born in Jamaica and moved to Philadelphia at age 5. He planned to become a classical conductor, but in his early 20s, he was signed by Cameo Records to create a Philadelphia version of Motown.

Bell is someone whose name I've seen all around the place back in the day spinning on records. With Gamble & Huff (whom he knew) and McFadden & Whitehead and Stevie Wonder there were few who could compete. It's rather stunning to know he hung out with Andre Watts. He was the man behind the Spinners, The Stylistics and many others. Listen to the show and if you're like me, you'll recognize many of the songs that formed your attitudes about romance.

### Me'Shell, Gay Black Creativity & Undismissable Symbolism

This afternoon, I'm doing a little bit of thinking about Me'Shell Ndegeocello and her music. Rather in the vibe of my last post about Speahead, I'm thinking about the fate of the art of hiphop from the perspective of the vibe between those I considered the best and their critical acceptance by the masses and the elites.

Like with Spearhead, even moreso, I found Me'Shelle's music overwhelmed by her message. Or another way to put it is that if I could get an instrumental of her stuff I'd be quite relieve, instead I have to suffer through lyrics I find objectionable. If anybody wants to come at me with the hardline about whether Conservatism closes my mind, this would be a good part to start. Cause I had a serious problem with 'Cookie', more than 'Bitter'. On her first album, I had no such qualms. In fact, it was a breath of fresh freshness, that came swinging with the funk and deep soulful stuff that's blue as all getout.  

I'm not certain about anything about MO's sexuality except that it's not certain, but the more I listen to her songs, the more unclear things become. It's hard to imagine anyone so 'alternative' on every perspective. She sings songs taunting Jesus from the perspective of the cursed of Ham. She sings of longing for marriage to a man she knows has other lovers. She questions the fidelity of her man in a stunning reversal of 'Who is He and What is He to You". We can only guess if she was 'studio gangsta' in that regard. I mean she can write a song like that begins:

> My mother used to whore herself  
> And my father would reap the benefits of her labor  
> It was almost as if she was absent  
> Absent form her own life.
> 
> I remember she would scrub the floors  
> for the white folks  
> Just to come home  
> To cook and clean for the man who broke her.

In her debut album with the slammin' hit "If That's Your Boyfriend", she cut a daring hottie profile. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought, man she needs a man like me, as we "hets" often brag. But what kind of expectations are brought to the surface or subliminated when a rocker goes ambidextrous on us? To pose the question a bit more broadly, what if anything should we expect from gay artists? Is there something fundamentally alienating about obscure sexual preferences that feed the rebellion of rock? If so aren't we begging the wrong questions of art or people? I approached this from a [sorta different angle before](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/12/fishbone_sadnes_1.html):

> But as an old conservative, not simply because I have a brain, I am a critic of the youth with poisoned and empty minds. Furthermore I am a critic of Rock for the sake of Rock. Permanent rebellion, permanent sensitivity to the injustices that plague us is not growth. And one has to ask how long is that dangling cigarette and caustic cynicism useful? Sure Mick Jaggar and Bob Dylan are in their 60s and people still come back for more. I say that there's something wrong with that - something's wrong with the person who remains a bleating sheep for a generation instead of becoming a sheepdog. Rap and Rock both are at their best when they are ragged and renegade. There is something Papa Roach has that outdoes Punk. There was something Marilyn Manson did that unseated all before him. Rock always needs a more jagged little pill. But after a while it gets hard to swallow. What good is all that rebellion?
> 
> More importantly what state of mind does it take to preside over an artform that at its best brings forth the raw emotions righteous indignation and contempt for the status quo? This manifest in a social disease of chronic dissatisfaction. There is nothing quite as sad as an old hippie whose revolution never happened. And you cannot listen to 'Give a Monkey a Brain' without feeling the strains of a grand dissolution of society.

And Shay presents [Andre Perry](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.popmatters.com/music/features/060717-blackmodernrocker.shtml) who asks:

> "While today's black indie rockers don't have much of a black-rock tradition to plug into, we do have considerable freedom in defining the poses black musicians can assume in modern rock. When a white frontman emerges from the underground, he will undoubtedly have to weather references to his predecessors (David Byrne, Mick Jagger, etc....) If Aristotle questioned how many new stories could actually be told, then consider how many new white rock n' roll icons can their actually be? No matter how hard Coldplay's Chris Martin tries, Radiohead's Thom Yorke will eternally have beaten him to the punch. In contrast, the black modern rocker moves in a space where expectations of certain racial performance have yet to be erected. People simply don't expect to see black people playing rock and roll. It defies racial expectations.

So are we supposed to be defying racial and sexual expectations through Rock & Roll or are we just more of the same commercialized rebellion? Don't we just engrain the alienation of Gay by doing gay rock? Don't we just reinforce the idea of blacks on the outside of society when Black Rock means "anything but Hootie"?

Nobody quite embodies such questions as Me'Shell Ndegeocello who is practically a musical instantiation of Audre Lourde's 'Sister Outsider' idea. Because her talent is undeniable, she forces us to look at stuff. We want her to be one of ours, but is she? Does she want to be? Is it us or is it her?

I don't have to have a conclusion right now for a couple reasons. I'm sure to revisit the subject. I'm still at work and I have a lot of things to do. Art doesn't require closure, just undismissable symbolism.

### Spearhead: Hiphop's Apotheosis

As part of the continuing fascination with the blackity black part of my intellect, a thought occurred to me that resides like a splinter in my mind. It is the greatness that is [Michael Franti](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.spearheadvibrations.com/index.html).

I cannot remember when I first heard of Franti, as I never really got so very deeply into the Disposable Heroes (or Digable Planets for that matter). But I think it must have been sometime around my [boohabian phase](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.mdcbowen.org/p2/bf/). Hard to say. What I do recall specifically was that one of my online friends was telling me that my writes (what you know about my writes?) resembled those of Franti. Full disclosure: before I was married, whilst living in Brooklyn, I believe that I had the potential to save hiphop from itself. I was one and a half degrees of separation from Brooklyn Moon, Fez Cafe, Nuyorican, The Freestyle Fellowship and Greg Tate's band. Get me drunk and I'll tell you what I did at a reverse poetry slam. So when I heard that compliment, a bit too late, it still went to my head. So I had to hear what this dude was all about.

If you ask me, Spearhead 'Home' has to be one of the greatest hiphop albums ever. Everything about it is close to perfection. It spun on my player many, many times, and despite and perhaps because of the difficulty in just grooving to cuts with serious themes like 'Positive' and 'Caught Without an Umbrella' it never got really tired. Franti pushed the envelope even further with 'Chocolate Supa Highway', his follow-up album, moving into a realm of art far beyond the groove.

I listened only once to the album that came after CSH. I think Franti just went off the edge of edgy into the realm of radicalization - he practically went Gangsta where the beats were just sublimated to the power of harsh words. Or maybe I was on my way to a right turn and it hurt my neck to turn my head and listen to his left direction. I mean I can get into an artist with the humor and wisdom to say within the same song 'fuck the police / we can keep the peace / we can make love and conquer that disease' and then 'throw your hands in the air / let me see your armpit hair', as he did on the Home album but after listening to [Gas Guage](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.xs4all.nl/~acvzwol/spearhead/gasgauge.html) for the fifth or sixth time, it just gets a bit too depressing.

But the fact that Franti can, with wit and style evoke such heart rending stories is testament to his craft and the possibilities of hiphop. His is true poetry, the kind you can't simply bob your head to without it rattling your brain. He handles mature subjects with maturity, and beyond that with respect for the genre of hiphop and a real flair for the right groove. His deadpan delivery strikes the perfect balance of coolness and gravity, his music a mix of funkified, ganjafied instrumental fusion. You never once get the impression with Spearhead that he has poked his head outside of a life of elevated blackified consciousness. I say without any sense of exaggeration that if anyone deserves to inherit the mantle of the crown worn by the late Curtis Mayfield, it would be Franti. And while I am just a bit too pragmatic in my politics to cosign all the stuff he's saying, he's got the right flavor. The only reason I don't compare him to Gil-Scott Heron is because I think Franti's life is more together. Check out this sample:  

> I am not a muslim but I read the final call  
> because within it's pages there is something for us all  
> and I am not a professional, but I love basketball  
> the squeakin of the sneakers they echo in the hall  
> But if I don't have enemies I'm not doin' my job  
> I might throw out a curve ball but I never throw a lob  
> people criticize me but I know it's not the end  
> I try to kick the truth not just to make friends
> 
> (chorus)  
> but hey diddle diddle  
> to the people in the middle  
> we got hot wax  
> and it's cookin' on the griddle  
> Got the guitar strummin  
> the drummer drummin  
> the people all hummin  
> and the vibe was lovin  
> on and on and on  
> 'till the breakadawn

That's the kind of jam I expect from a righteous black brother. Except. Michael Franti doesn't fit the genetic profile.

I would not be so bold to suggest anything beyond the obvious. Franti's pedigree, as perfect as it stands within the context of the art, has not endeared him to a mass audience. And I'm surely not the first person to think what a tragic irony it is for hiphop to make a greater star out of Eminem than Franti. Which goes to the real meat of this piece aside from my intent to communicate how cool I think he is.

One of the most oft-quoted bits of popular wisdom about hiphop's commercial success is that is that it owes to the listening habits of white suburban teenage boys. I'm going to step out on a limb and suggest that I'm something of an expert of this dynamic. Or at least I'm willing to say that sometimes it's real easy as a man to see what's going on in boy heads. I'll reduce it to a simple concept, over-mothering. The reason suburban teen boys go for the dirrty is because they can't get dirty at home and their parents are trying desparately to raise little princes. Stereotypical enough? That is essentially the gut of the 'frat boy' audience of rap. I'm not trying to raise this analysis to anything about the suburbs or whitefolks except to the extent as it is not what we are inclined to think about as the core audience for hiphop. But let me keep it real, I'm talking about *my* hiphop. After all it was my generation that wore the bandannas on our Chucks in 1985. We were the ones responsible for overloading it with significance in our desparation not to be completely subsumed into New Wave and sick and tired of that same old funk.

Then again, we had a cultural agenda and we were mad successful. American pop culture is blacker because we did our part, but please distinguish between our producers (Jimmy Jam, Babyface, Full Force, Prince) and those running sh\*t today. Franti inherits the mantle of those people who listened to groups like Madhouse, oh yeah and like I said, Curtis Mayfield and Gil Scott-Heron.

So let me be so bold as to beat the dead horse of black cultural nationalism again and ask if hiphop is black in the sense of demographics or in terms of a constructed and maintained aesthetic. I, of course, would prefer the latter taking Culture seriously. For those reasons I promote Franti over just about every hiphop artist out there save Chuck D, Dres, Wycleff, Andre 3K, QTip and Posdnous. And still I say Franti is the most mature and thoughtful of the bunch. I call his art black consciousness in and quite frankly you can't get any more explicit than Dream Team:

> Well Chuck D'sannouncin'/ Flava's doin' color  
> halftime enterntainment by Dre and Ed Lover  
> Malcolm X is the coach he's drawin' up the strategy  
> he's choppin up America's anatomy  
> 'cause they're the ones/ we're up against of course  
> are general manager is Chief Crazy Horse  
> Huey Newton/ 'cause he was extra hard  
> he's the one/ who would be playin at the shootin' guard  
> I dreamed Charles Barkley would be  
> played by Marcus Garvey  
> he'd be throwin people off his back and makin  
> sure they never got a rebound rebound / and  
> he'd throw it to the outlet  
> Nat Turner/ 'cause he can turn the corner when  
> he's out there  
> he be flyin through the air/ throwin passes like  
> he really doesn't care/behind the back /and in  
> between the legs  
> he's handlin the rock /as gently as an egg  
> he's throwin it in/ to Angela Davis's neighborhood  
> she's postin up down in the extra hard wood

So there you have it. To the extent that hiphop is political culture, nobody exemplifies it like Franti. I disagree with him of course, but he's an artist and his statements are clear, his art is nuanced and he's a smart rebel. He has respect for the genre and extends and expands it, and quite frankly, he knows how to jam. None of it would be worth a dime if he didn't, and so he gets props.

I'll just leave it this way. If there were more artists like him hiphop wouldn't be so sorry. We can only hope for the sake of what it might have been, that more of the younger set grow up with Franti's example in mind.

### Left Critics Made Hiphop Keep It Real

There's a bit of a discussion about the romanticism of Old School Hiphop [over at Blackprof](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.blackprof.com/archives/2006/06/the_romanticization_of_old_sch.html). I weigh in. (and wish they would turn on trackbacks)

The Old School of hiphop was not politically expressive, it was dance music, and those of us who got sick of those annoying talk boxes used by Midnight Starr and Newcleus couldn't be happier. There was no real message in hiphop until De La Soul and Public Enemy around 88. Before that, the'deepest' message from hiphop were the exceptions of 'The Message' and then 'Friends' by Whodini. (Produced by the late lamented Arif Mardin, who also worked with Herbie Hancock at the time). If there was a renaissance in hiphop towards the 'intellectual' it was the now long dead era of 'gods and earths' exemplified by groups such as Brand Nubian, Rakim, Wu-Tang, X-Clan et-al. On the more popular side were Arrested Development and PM Dawn (yes PM Dawn). All of this was done in closer communication with the Spoken Word movement, and if there ever was a golden age of conscious rap, it was right there between 90 and 92. Including Gangstarr and ATCQ, Latifah and the Native Tongues, who through Jimmy Jay started to take rap international and bring non-English speaking rappers into the American fold.

But the death of that era came with the LA Riots and the incredicble concession that Ice Cube and NWA were prophetic, that Gangsta was more in touch with the 'reality' of blackfolks than somebody like Speech from Arrested Development. That KRS-1's militant posturing was an authentic expression of the deep seated frustrations that plague inner-city at risk youth in America today.. you've heard it a million times.

So if hiphop became prostituted into violent misogyny and to quote the now vindicated Cornel West 'nihilism', it is because so many left intellectuals conceded to the artistic expressions of those hard streets. All it took was a modicum of talent (Tupac) and then no matter what rappers like Onyx said, the critical response was "I ain't mad at ya".

Left critics are responsible as any for cosigning that which was 'keeping it real'.

There were some bright spots of hard resistance to the ugly directions of hiphop, most notably the protestations and steam roller of C. Dolores Tucker. I honestly can't remember what my reaction was at the time, but I've always had a gripe about the distance critics had from it. The only person I thought who really had a handle on all of the implications of the messages and artistic sensibilities of hiphop was **Greg Tate**. If anybody on the planet ought to be blogging, it should be Greg Tate,. I should find out where he stands on this particular issue. I'm sure [his ideas are not static](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/01/25/174125.php). Obviously I didn't read The Source or much of Vibe so I was never hip to [Danyel](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.coloredgirls.com/Otherviews/danyelsmith_interview.html) until I became informed by [Jimi](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.jimiizrael.com/ji.html). I'm sure there was an anti-censorship contingent making noise at the time, but it was too late for Tucker anyway. Black critics didn't nurture hiphopers and so there was no stopping them by the time they became commercially successful.

Remember that even in the heyday of Public Enemy, hiphop's longevity was still in question. Quincy was still trying to make that point when 'Back on the Block' came out. But the Tevin Campbells of the world were sunk by the time there was a body of critical literature on the genre. At this point, the intrigues of the The Source, Vibe and the hiphop industry are a fasciating subject, and Jimi Izrael is the online factotum.

The cultural revolution that is the bomb that hiphop dropped on American pop is a mixed blessing for sure. In one way it formed a multi-racial context for American youth culture that was once only sustained by the Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder and EWF. In another way it hardened anti-black stereotypes and corrupted the very idea of what is legitimately political. In that context despite the complete destruction of KRS-1 by a black female intellectual whose name escapes me, I find the Left responsible for goosing along these rebels.  
  
The Right on the other hand has been completely dismissive of rap as not music at all. And their alramist predictions about Public Enemy as well as their advocacy of political harrassment of Ice Cube by the FBI was reactionary and foolish. In the end they were no more wrong than Tucker or Tipper Gore, too much of rap is in fact degenerate and has, without question, lowered the standards of decency of commercial radio. But their default in delivering that message in a manner appropriate to music criticism is yet another great failure.  
  
One is left to wonder how much energy of American youth has been misdirected into the 'politics' of hiphop. I tend to believe that it is another species of ignorant and youthful rebellion given too much attention and gnashing of middle class teeth, like the most lightweight of 'radical' hippies of the 60s.  
  
In the wake of this legitimation of the commercial aspects of youth culture, we are left with 'Kidz Bop' and other mindless pap. Maybe country music will save us from ourselves.

### De La Day

I'm chillin' at the office with 60GB of MP3s on the La Cie. Today it's wall to wall De La Soul on the headset. Again as I engage with the Progressives over at P6 in search of some referenceable blackness, I'm taking up cudgels. I'm going to use a bit of De La to make part of a point that I'm attempting to make. Who are the Committees?

To the Lyrics from 'Held Down' off Bionix:

> ```
> [Cee-Lo]
> Allow me.. to break it down.. ah yea yea yea yea yeahh..
> Life.. {*humming*}[Pos]
> This is dedicated to all my folks
> Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin
> And never took the time to fall in line or follow
> or swallow the thoughts
> Of the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities
> Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type
> You from the same type of people try to hold you down
> Just because you tailor made for bigger and better things
> Never missed a chance to move ahead of things
> And what does it bring?  I tell you for me
> it brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin
> Cats posin as my fan just to get grabbin what's mine
> I'm livin in times where my daughters are found around
> kids who can't afford thinkin caps
> But always found drinkin raps and eatin off beats
> Claimin laws of the streets - but who made the laws?
> Everybody playin +Rebel+ with no sign of a +Cause+[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
> Well I, feel the world around me
> I've found, that others, will bring you down, just to be down
> You've got to make up your mind, where you wanna be
> Where you wanna go with your life
> With your life..[Pos]
> Yo, I'm never singin the blues but findin the clues to maintain
> And I been blessed to reign supreme over nearly every dream
> I had, and I made it come true
> I'm an imperfect man and I'm holdin the clue
> to perfection, it doesn't seem to matter what direction I look
> I find people settin traps
> Tryin to find the goal - without havin any maps
> Even friends of mine, jumped on line, just to become my adversary
> They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made
> They don't come to chill or behave
> And they got, toast ready to burn
> Not learnin to live, but they yearnin to take what you earn[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
> Well I, feel the world around me
> I've found, that others, will bring you down, just to be down
> You see - you've got to make up your mind, where you wanna be
> And where you wanna go with your life
> With your life..[Pos]
> So quick to place blame.. and deny the shame we bring upon ourselves
> So many names held accountable for my own account
> When a large amount was weight - that I made and shaped
> When I climbed I found
> It was hard to find others around to point my fingers at
> Which made me realize the truth
> The biggest supressor could be your own ego lookin for an excuse
> to plant roots, in a field of self-sorrow
> to sprout and follow the first thing you feel
> Nourishes your hunger to be respected, it gets hectic
> And when I'm watchin the news, and my daughter walks in
> and choose to ask, "Why were all those people on the floor
> sleepin, covered in red?"  I told her
> that they were lookin for God, but found religion instead[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
> Well I, feel the world around me
> I've found, that others, will bring you down; just to be down
> You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you wanna be
> And where you wanna go with yo' life
> With your life, with your life..{*Cee-Lo harmonizes and ad libs with choir*}[Cee-Lo]
> I need my SPAAAACE, to live..Well I, feel the world around me
> I've found, that others, will bring you down; just to be down
> You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you wanna be
> And where you wanna go with yo' life
> With your life, with your life..
> ```

Pos says just about everything that needs to be said in the first stanza...

### If I Were King of Hiphop

This morning I listened to, for the second time in a week, 'The Real Roxanne'. The second thing that popped into my head was the question I posed to the Spousal Unit. "Do you now or did you ever know the difference between Roxanne Shante and The Real Roxanne?" The more I search the confusededer I become. I only know the mp3 song which I didn't buy.

The first thing that popped into my head was that the reason there are no female rap stars in America is because Roxanne put such a devastating headshot to the dome of UTFO. Listening to her dis from 1984 still stings to this very day. "The only operating that you do is ripping off cars in a minute or two".

What hiphop needs is more like homegirl. Telling tales out of school like Shorty No Mass. Women hiphop couldn't handle, aside from Latifa and the hyper-hos, were the sweet, smart-mouthed ones that simply weren't impressed. So the Real Roxanne (if that's her) fits for sure. Also Patra, who was all that. I liked Oaktown's 357 no matter what anybody says, but hey, I was in my 20s.

And if I were the King of Hiphop the second thing I would do is assemble a marching band. I'm sure I mentioned this before - a hiphop chorus something like a hyped up drill team. At the very least it would revolutionize idiot protest march chants. See, the way I look at it, there hasn't been anything like Self-Destruction since Self-Destruction. Not that we need any lessons, but the coolness was the variety of voices.

'Scenario' right now, has to be the grand champion of mixing voices and styles in a single rap title. If I remember correctly, this was the one that debuted Busta Rhymes' then brand new style - the one that put him over the top.

That's all folks.

### Greatest Rap Lyrics - Part 1

Craig Mack's Flava in Ya Ear was one of those songs that just electrified the world. You listened to it, you couldn't believe it, you didn't know the title or the rapper but all you knew was you had to hear it again, and again. I think this is one of the last hiphop songs that had that effect on me although it's difficult to recall which may have been the absolute last.

> Craig Mack  
> 1000 degrees  
> You'll be on your knees  
> and you'll be burnin', beggin' please  
> Brother FREEZE! {BOY!...}  
> Man's indisputed  
> and deep-booted  
> funk smoke that leaves your brains booted  
> This bad M.C.  
> with stamina like Bruce Jenner  
> the winner  
> Tasting M.C.'s for dinner  
> You're crazy like that glue {...you're crazy, boy, You're crazy.}  
> to think that you  
> could out-do  
> my one-two  
> that's sick like the flu {...shake 'em down, Mack}  
> BOY, I flip  
> BOY all the time, 'cause  
> BOY, the rhyme you're kickin' {HAAAAAAAAA! BOY!...}  
> ain't worth a dime  
> Seems like there's no competition  
> in this rap world expedition  
> You come around,  
> I'll knock you out \[of\] position {... knock 'em out!}  
> No flav  
> could ever dig a grave  
> for the Mack  
> the power pack  
> in black  
> makin' cement crack {...make it crack...}

Every rap fan on the planet knows this rhythm now, but there is no way to rap this without having heard Craig Mack do it. This is the second stanza and it is nothing like the first or the third. It's just completely unique. The 'stamina like Bruce Jenner' moves at a completely different pace than 'youre crazy like that glue'. The phrasing can't even be called classic, it simply hasn't been duplicated. Now there is one possible exception to that which is 'Shake Ya Ass' which also works in stanzas with refrains each stanza with unique phrasings. That too was massive breakout single, unique in every way.

Making a rap like this is extraordinarily complicated. It's something I think George Clinton thought he was doing on several occasions, breaking walls of beats per line with compression, or letting it go over into the next measure. Failed completely.

Not enough can be said about the complimentary responses {in braces} that the second voice adds to the rap. As far as I know, only Flavor Flav has done this consistently in his world-rocking duets with Chuck D, but this unknown rapper behind Craig Mack is a serious partner in making 'Flava in Ya Ear' one of the great lyrical triumphs of all time.

### The Non-Guilty Pleasure of French Hardcore Rap

*"Aiguisé comme lame  
Pointu comme un couteau  
Chauffé comme une flamme  
Et puissant comme un fusil d'assaut."*  
\-- Raggasonic

Maybe I should have made the title of this a little less specific, but there it is. I'm listening to some hardcore gangsta rap by DJ Cut Killer (avec le Funky Family) and I don't understand it, but I get it.

As I sit here completely engrossed in a funky beat, I know without a shadow of a doubt that whatever it is they are saying in French is as trashy as a rat smoking crack in the sewer. But since I can't really understand a word of it, it's just cool. Every inch of the flavor is translated through the music, the beats, the intonation, the edge, the phrasing - you can taste it but you can't name it. Every once in a while the rappers get bilingual and I have to cringe for a moment, but most of the time... nah.

I've been a fan of French Rap since '93 when I first encountered MC Solaar. I was walking about aimlessly, trying to pick up intellectual chicks somewhere in the Boston metro area when I heard something over the speakers in a record store that stopped my heart. It turned out to be DJ Jazzy Jay's collection including Menelik, Democrat D, Sleo, Sens Unique Posse, Moda & Dan (my favorite cut) and of couse the one and only MC Solaar. And for my own memory, Michael, you did know Solaar *before* you knew Francine Mondon. Oh her? She was the cutie law student from West Africa studying in London. Her brother was making a killing in mudcloth and kente. Ahh single life amongst the New World Africans of the 90s... but I digress.

Several years ago, the Spousal Unit went to Paris to hang with our cousine. She brought back Raggasonic and the fire was rekindled. Here was profanity I could blast in my new 8 speaker Turbo Beetle without a stitch of guilt. I have long liked the mix of flavor and mental gymnastics that this kind of music brings forth as well as the mau-mau effect it can evoke at the suburban stoplight. While I am way too mature and sophisticated for that kind of posturing now (as an august member of the Republican Club), on occasion I will lapse.. like every spring and summer afternoon when the sun is shining, my rims are clean and my windows are down.

My all-time favorite? IAM's Le Feu. It is one of the best party raps since K7's 'Come Baby Come'. Also Poussiere d'Ange from Raggasonic is the bomb. Straight out of <strike>Compton</strike> Le 19eme Arrondissment. WHAT!?

### What's Spinning

In addition to some Squarepusher and the new Gorillaz album that I've picked up recently, there are three CDs that are just burning my ears up all day and night. Each of them are four out of five stars, and I thought you should know.  
**  
I'm Free**  
Ray Parker Jr. has been to the desert on a horse with no name and he's come out smiling. If you listen to 'The Guitar Man' his new album 'Im Free', you might think that you're listening to America, not the country, the group. But you are listening to a new Ray Parker and realize that this is the man with an ear for the kind of pop that used to rock the nation sweetly. Ray Parker sings about sex in a way that's almost embarrassingly honest. It's grown up, not 'adult'. The most sexy word he uses is 'sex', but not in a George Michael kind of way, rather in a forgive me father for I have sinned kind of way. In fact, I don't think that before this album I've ever heard the word 'fornication' sung. But that's not half the beauty of this album which has three cuts that sound destined for the Smooth Jazz Hall of Fame, and two more that are anthems for party cruises. On I'm Free, Parker comes off as a combination of Jimmy Buffett meets Billy Dee Williams, but never far from the Ray Parker of old who was never ashamed to admit that he was in love with the other woman. Does it come off as a Mid Life Crisis album, unabashedly so, but one with a happy ending. There's nothing bitter about it, and it basically goes to show that you cannot keep a good man down. Every pop star ought to have the maturity and fun loving triumph that Parker shows. It's good listening. I hope it hits.

**A Tale of 3 Cities**  
One of the best rap albums of all time was cut back in 1994 by a jazz prodigy and four rappers you never heard of before. I don't know how to express how slammin' and funky is Steve Coleman and Metrics album 'A Tale of 3 Cities'. But if you haven't heard it, then you owe it to yourself to know what hiphop might have been in the hands of artists rather than pop stars. You don't need to be so very prepared for this venture into verbal ballistics and sonic excellence, but it will help you get your bearings if you know The Roots, Buckshot LeFonque and The Freestyle Fellowship. That's the level we're talking here. I dug this one out of the archives and it took me back to the last days of real inspirational hiphop - of Broun Fellinis and that new group called the Fugees who did more of what you liked Digable Planets for. Its got all of the raucous without the raunchy, and did I mention lyrical devastation? This is destined to be a classic - it slams even these 12 years later, and I still want to listen to it. That's practically a miracle in the hiphop world and almost unheard of with rap lyrics you haven't even memorized.

**Beautiful World**  
I don't know why but there is nothing quite so annoying as Sting reinterpreting his own music. It is almost the very definition of pretense. Better he follow Rod Stewart and record some standards. On the other hand, there is nothing that shows the genius of Sting's ample songwriting skills quite like other reinterpretations of his songs. If you want to hear a perfect rendition of 'Fragile', then you need to run, don't walk and get your hands on Take 6' 'Beautiful World'. You will find there a gorgeous set of covers that not only do justice, but go one better. Bill Whithers, Donald Fagin, Stevie Wonder, Michael McDonald have never sounded so good. Take 6 takes a short sidetrip from their usual devotional music into the realm of smooth R&B and rip it up. I can't decide which cut I like better between their remake of Donny Hathaway's 'Someday We'll All Be Free' with Lalah Hathaway, or of Lovely Day the classic Bill Whithers cut. Maybe it's the funky rendition of 'Loves in Need of Love Today', or maybe it's 'Takin It To The Streets'. You just gotta hear it all, over and over.

### Music Snobbery

I had one of those rare moments when just one look at a black person takes me into a different dimension.

So I'm taking F8 now F9 into Joe's Crab Shack for a birthday luncheon and we pull into the parking lot. And there is homeboy with his date in his brand new Mustang, sitting in the driveway about to head out. And he looks at me, as I pull up in the fly 740iL as if he cannot believe that there are other black people on the planet who know about this place, much less can roll up in with a sweet whip. I saw all that in a split second. Shock & envy. Two seconds later he burns rubber and is gone. Tsk. I knew it.

So as we sing happy birthday we get through the 'traditional' go round, and then we are suprised (now it's us) by another group across the room by the Stevie Wonder version. Everybody knows it, but only the brothers in the crowd sing the long harmony in the second part. And then it all grinds to a halt because.. well the verse hasn't been adapted, only the chorus. Since my favorite pastime with the kids is drilling them on extended common sense, we continue our trivia questions. Boy, who is studying geology wants me to ask he questions about plate tectonics and shear faults. I don't know jack about that and ask him about the largest fresh water lakes. He nails that so I switch gears and ask him to describe the process of filling up a car with gas. Hmm. That's a new twist - describe a process instead of 'name 6'...

So now it's wifey and sister's turn. Name 6 record labels. They come up with some wack ones I never heard of so I give it up. So now I turn the tables and get deeply into the polymorphous thing called Black Culture. Name three record labels that Stevie Wonder recorded on. Yeah boy. Now wait. I expected that everyone would get Motown. Easy. But I expected most self-respecting black people to know Stevie's big private record label. But neither sister nor wifey knew. Damn! My response? I coulda married a white girl!

Only I was half wrong when I said the third was 'Black Bull'. It turns out the Black Bull was not a label but a publishing company which in combination with Jobete own, I guess, most of the Stevie Wonder catalog. Now not being in the music business, I don't know a whole lot of this, but I did grow up in the generation of people who stared at albums as they spun at 33 1/3. So I knew answers to questions like what was Parliament's label (hint, they shared it with the Doobie Brothers). Or was that Funkadelic? Not entirely sure. But I damned sure knew the first names of the Brothers Johnson and I knew which group recorded on T-Neck Records (speaking of brothers). That my wife and her sister were completely stumped on these matters, they attributed to the fact that I was a DJ and obsessive. Sister says she just wasn't that old and was too po' to afford all them records. Yeah right. They didn't know which Eagles album Heartache Tonight was on. Actually, they didn't know it was the Eagles till I told them.

What is my marriage coming to? These are the things I expect people who claim black culture to know. But I guess sometimes there's no accounting for taste. Which brings me to the second semi-serious point of this post, which is that today's music ain't nothing to fall in love to. And I even got Pops to admit that the only people talking 'bout love, my brother is the preacher. And it seems, nobody's interested in learning, but the teacher. Wait a minute. I've heard that somewhere before. Do you know where? No really.

If you want to fall in love to the music being written today, you need to turn to a country station. And that's what Pops actually admitted. It's true. I'm going to listen to some more starting... hmm next year. I'm still on my Cobblers Hiphop mission, and now we have 12, so the charting begins.

### Fishbone, Monk & Mingus

Back in the day, while I was still Talented Tenth but not yet through the more radical phases of Black Mental Liberation, I used to wonder what kind of white man I would resemble. In every black man's vocab is found 'cool white boy', although these days on XBox Live I more often hear 'white niggas'. Be that as it may, at one point or another I believe all of us think about trading skins.

This is different from trading places, it's just the whole what would I look like if I was white and still the same person. Naturally, one would be a 'cool white boy'. So after some time engaging in this fantasy I finally figured out the type I would want to look like, if I had the reverse Watermelon Man power. It turned out to be Eddie Rabbit. I thought about this yesterday upon seeing a picture of Sir Richard Branson because he has that same kind of look, at least to me. The other person who has it is Chuck Norris. Redford has it now but he had always been just too pretty. So there you have it. I would have a kind of redheaded, blue-eyed weatherbeaten cowboy look and very likely to be wearing facial hair.

Since I haven't thought about this for a long time, over 20 years in fact, it surprised me when I went to the Charlie Hunter & Bad Plus concert to see how the fashion has changed from the 1980 version of Eddie Rabbit. See the house was packed, but there were only 3 black heads in the room - one of them Hunter's drummer. The rest of the young hipsters have a look I now know but not well enough to describe in their own argot. Yet it reminded me of how I often felt way back in the day at Fishbone concerts.

Fishbone is **the** black rock & roll band. If you don't know who they are, I would say that your understanding of modern rock is severely crippled, especially if you think the Red Hot Chili Peppers have any talent. Fishbone and the Peppers were the hottest bands in LA back in '84. Both have lasted to this day, one in the sun of popularity the other in shadow. If Fishbone has a flaw it is that they never had a song that girls would like to dance to. Or put another way, back in the days when there was Wendy O Williams and everybody else, there weren't many chicks who'd accompany you to the mosh at a Fishbone concert. A black girl? Perish the thought. There were maybe 5 out of 3000, three were with the band, one didn't know where she was and I married the fifth.

Where is Fishbone today? I have no idea. Fish was one of the greatest rock drummers ever. But the point is that they were out there in territory that aint mainstream, nor even mainstream black.

To the extent that one's identity comes from this modern sense of affiliation and fan loyalty, not to mention inspiration, it has always been somewhat disconcerting to me that we black rockers were dipped in the buttermilk. It wasn't that we minded our company, but that we were alienated from our homes and homeboys. Then again, isn't that what much music is all about? Fishbone was all about too much energy for cool. They weren't smooth. They were happy rage.

Being a part of the Fishbone world put me on the edge, if not the outs with the Talented Tenth. And my love for them, as well as for the angular crankiness of Monk and Mingus is part of the reasons I consider myself on the progressive edge of the previously proud group formerly known as the Talented Tenth.

Pops is about to put together a seminar on Monk and Mingus. So he asked me to whip him up a DVD full of mp3s. I have just shy of seven hours of recordings. I also have the 'Straight No Chaser' video, and I swear it's still a marvel to watch Monk play 'Just a Gigolo' solo.

If alienation and rebellion are part and parcel of brilliance, then it means a great deal for the individual. And yet what is a concert but a gathering of individuals who are different from the world in the same way? One cannot help but look around to see who else shares the love. We can all buy the same T-shirt, but then we spread out and disappear into the interstices of modern life.

No conclusion...

### The Bad Plus at the Knitting Factory

I'm clearly not going to be able to transcribe my experience last week at the Knitting Factory. I'd be drafting this post forever. I'll just put it out there. In a word, phenomenal.

The Bad Plus is an acoustic jazz trio that performs like a rock band. They have, between the three of them, as much dynamic range as an orchestra. The amount of noise, control and wit they display is mind-boggling. At once you want to close your eyes and absorb it all, then you want to shout for them to play a favorite song, and then you want to stare with your mouth open. Then you look at the crowd and see if all the dudes are bopping their heads at the same rhythm that you're feeling. Yep.

I spent the better part of an hour mesmerized by drummer David King's acrobatics. Using everything from walkie-talkie feedback to tinkle toys, he extracts a pile of clinks, bumps and grinds from his kit that bring to mind the raving staccato of cups against bars in an asylum. His arms seem to be doing the rubber pencil trick. I've never seen cymbals go from full roar to silence in a fraction of a second and then back again in the next. He stands and slams the outside of the cymbals and a half second later he is seated at the hihat with all of the gongs silent, a half second later he's rubbing a stainless steel mixing bowl over the ribs of the kettle drum. What you hear in the end is extraordinary punctuation bracketing playful silences in the midst of Bad Plus music.

Ethan Iverson, the pianist, suited up, is playing as if he had an entire symphony behind him. He is at once completely in his own world of intricate melodies and in eerie synch with the band. He has a perfect sense of oblivion to the antics of his sidemen, and when watching the trio from behind him, stage left, you get a completely different sense of the band. He runs with his right hand and doesn't play left like a jazz pianist at all not that you'd hear much considering the prodigious work of the bassman, Reid Anderson who manages to hold all this wild energy together. As the writer of most of the material played, Reid knows what works and has an impressive sense of what these three can do.

I didn't hear my favorite of their tunes from their most recent albums 'Vistas' and "Give' which is called 'Dirty Blonde', but I recognized enough of what they did play to realize that what sounds unleahsed is actually very precise. In fact, when you really get to know the complications of their rhythmic interpretations you find that they are suggestive and playful almost to the point of silliness. They stretch everything beyond breaking with an almost cartoon physics, and yet without quite swinging, they rock. They literally rock.

It is in this that they are a phenomenon in the making. Their cover of 'We Are The Champions' is subtle, witty, melodic and punctuated with just the right reconstructions of their deconstructions. More of this will make them big stars.

### Rock Recovery

I'm stepping up my mission to Rock Recovery. It's true that I am a lover of all kinds of music and I do mean [all kinds](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/000150.html), but if you asked me yesterday to name 4 songs by Led Zeppelin I would have deserved a smack. So the recovery mission is all about giving names and recognition to those things I actually know, or at least recognize.

It's wonderful to discover and eyeball straightly cultural things that have always been in the peripheral vision. Well, it's wonderful when those things found are worth finding. **'Black Dog'**, for example is worth finding. Sure I've always known the song, but now I know that I know it. Sometimes these discoveries are embarassing. For example, I've always thought that they guy who sung 'Smooth' on the Supernatural album, **Rob Thomas**, ought to have a promising future. I didn't know until yesterday that he was the lead for Matchbox 20.

Sometimes the work of an artist is so large that it takes a long time to recognize what the big deal is. Googling their most notable works doesn't help. I've always known that 'Shattered' is a great rock song, but I have yet to discover what is so great about the Rolling Stones other than 'Satisfaction' and 'Start Me Up'. I still don't know what the big deal about **Eric Clapton** is.

The group that is surprising me the most, I must say is The Who. The first time I heard **Baba O'Reilly** was during a montage in Spike Lee's 'Summer of Sam'. It not only blew my mind but it made the movie for me. Now with Behind Blue Eyes, I'm feeling them.

I do rather like Matchbox 20, and I cannot stand Collective Soul. I've always known Supertramp. I'm certain there's something to The Clash I've yet to discover. I think U2 is probably too pretentious to like. I've always liked New Years Day and I suppose that's all they ever have to do - aside from Beautiful Day. I actually tried to like REM when they first came out. They do nothing for me. Same thing with X.

I really enjoy the new alternative punks. Green Day, Offspring, Rage Against the Machine, Modest Mouse, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit. But the Stone Temple Pilots are far and away my favorites. There is Fishbone of course and Foreigner and.. we'll there's a lot of music out there. I'll be doing this for a while.

### Next Six

Continuing on talking about jazz albums has me thinking that I ought to do this a bit more. That is to say on a regular basis, I ought to talk about Jazz and the Old School. I haven't read any jazz criticism recently and I used to fulminate about it quite a bit. I'm at a significant disadvantage, not being a musician, but I have cultivated quite an appetite and taste for good music. But more on that later...

**In This House On This Morning  
Blood On The Fields  
The Majesty of the Blues**

I include these three works all as one, and will be all of the **Wynton Marsalis** I will talk about. There is so much of his work to admire not only because he is probably the most prolific jazz musician of his generation but because his gifts speak beyond the realm of pure music into the soul of the nation. Each of these works delves deeply into a theme which moves beyond the context of a jazz album per se. Tthe first two are more like concertos with a number of different movements. Revisiting 'In This House' this Sunday last I can't help but be drawn to the magic of gospel music without lyrics. It's a pure distilled kind of gutbucket celebration. It's the holy ghost without sweating ladies falling into the aisles, its the moaning rocking rhythm without the broken contrite faces of the darkling race. There's something deep here for me personally all evoked, like Shug Avery going back to sing in her father's church. God is trying to tell you something. Wynton lets you fill in the blanks. Blood On the Fields is deeper still, a three volume expedition into the days of the whip. The Majesty of the Blues is a complete album in the more traditional sense which contains, [The Death of Jazz](https://web.archive.org/web/20250911103325/https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/clipserve/B0000026SE001003/1/103-0073728-6439803) which is the song I want played at my funeral.

**Beyond Words - Bobby McFerrin**  
This is the curveball I'm throwing. This is one of the most beautiful collection of songs I've ever heard. If you know Bobby McFerrin, you have an idea of what he is capable of creating. This album is far and away his most refined and well-balanced work as well as his most serious jazz compositions to date. If you are still thinking of the silly lightness of 'Play' or the antics of 'Spontaneous Inventions' you are in for a great shock. McFerrin goes straight to jazz roots with Chick Corea as well as with Omar Hakim and several other fine musicians. In a departure from his showcasing of vocal virtuosity, he truly collaborates with his musicians into a new kind of fusion. McFerrin has evolved scatting to a new plane and created an international platform for wordless lyricism. This is truly a remarkable achievement.

  
**Birth of the Cool - Miles Davis**  
It's difficult for me to disaggregate my Miles Davis. Before I bought his complete Columbia box set, I had listened primarily to his newer stuff, the kind that all the purists hated, namely Tutu. I am still discovering Miles in an ass backward sort of way. I fall in love with a song and then come to discover Miles authored it 20 years before the cover I'm listening to. Birth of the Cool is one of the few Miles Davis single albums I have, but I know a classic when I hear one.

**Romantic Warrior - Return to Forever**  
A lot of things about jazz fusion have soured over time. I was weaned on Stanley Clarke's bombast, halfway up that food chain, not quite ready for Mahavishnu. Four years after wigging out on Mannheim Steamroller and Earth Wind & Fire's jazzier pieces (like Sun Goddess) I ran smack dab into the sonic wall of RTF and was flattened. To this day, Romantic Warrior stands as a singular masterpiece. It seems almost impossible that musicians could play so quickly and intricately in synch, flare out to improvisation and slam back to the improbably complex choruses that they do. But this is the essence of this complex music, and you don't want to miss that.

I've been told apropos RTF that I need to check out the tangent that leads to King Crimson, Emerson Lake & Palmer and Yes. I am fortunate not to listened to any of these bands, so I know good times await me.
