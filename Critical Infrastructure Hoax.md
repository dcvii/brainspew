2\. Super short story version on @joerogan of how this plot set in motion above, "Say something about a critical infrastructure threat to elections to feel menace," from today's classified annex, snowballed into the Disinformation Governance Control to control social media speech <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1951056874876379136/pl/o26bRCtBrwI_irrQ.m3u8?v=da5&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1951056874876379136/vid/avc1/930x720/ppwO4odt37tcYI5K.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1951056874876379136/vid/avc1/1078x834/EH-WWWvOhOFRW03z.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1951056874876379136/vid/avc1/464x360/Gmf3K_YtHf9HiRw2.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1951056874876379136/vid/avc1/348x270/wG-QSlUjtb4FhyKF.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

@joerogan 3. Note, for example, how DHS ‚Äî who mass censored virtually the entire Trump movement during the 2020 election ‚Äî got away with censoring by citing power to ‚Äúprotect critical infrastructure‚Äù of elections from ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù, self-aware they bumped up against the First Amendment

@joerogan 4. DHS‚Äôs social media censorship council, led by its outside censorship partners Vijaya Gadde (head of censorship at Twitter 1.0) and Kate Starbird, was named the ‚ÄúProtecting Critical Infrastructure from Misinformation & Disinformation‚Äù council for this same scam legal reason

5\. IF YOU WERE CENSORED IN 2020 FOR QUESTIONING MAIL-IN BALLOTS OR VOTING MACHINES, THIS CLASSIFIED ANNEX TODAY IS WHY. Here's a medium-length primer on how US government used this unbelievably deceitful false predicate of "critical infrastructure" to censor MILLIONS in the 2020 election. We now know, that all was part of an explicit plan, classified since July 2016 plan but known to the CIA and FBI this whole time, to "Say something about a critical infrastructure threat to elections to feel menace" while "the evidence" for any actual threat to elections was "regrettably still unavailable." (the CIA and FBI would then make up that evidence 5 months later, using the bullshit made-up discredited Steele Dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign itself)

6\. On January 6 2017, two weeks before Trump took office, two last-ditch ops were launched at once: (1) the Obama intelligence community launched Russiagate with a formal (utter bullshit) report claiming Russia interfered in the election (2) DHS took federal control over elections, by designating the metaphysical concept of "elections" as "critical infrastructure" under its own domain. All 50 states opposed DHS doing this. But the outgoing Obama federal government steamrolled all 50 states anyway.  
  

7\. It is no coincidence both the cooked crooked intelligence community report launching Russiagate and the DHS federal takeover of elections as "critical infrastructure" (citing the same-day Russiagate intelligence assessment) BOTH happened on January 6, 2017. That was the SAME day Democrats' hail mary last-ditch plot to stop Trump's election certification failed, and Trump's win was certified. With no options left to stop Trump's presidency, they didn't even wait a day to launch what appeared to be their Plan B: if Trump can't be stopped from becoming President, immediately hobble his presidency that same day the presidency was inevitable.  
  

8\. And in fact, that is exactly the time sequence of how it played out on January 6, 2017. First, at 1:41pm, Congress certified Trump‚Äôs election win. Then, with Trump‚Äôs win now final and no hope left for the intelligence community to obstruct it, then suddenly, magically, the entire joint US intelligence community assessment drops just 4 hours later, with a report directly insinuating Trump‚Äôs win was illegitimate because Russia intervened to help Trump win. Then, suddenly, magically, DHS just 30 minutes after that swoops in with a permanent unilateral federal designation that it has taken over state-level control of voting systems ‚Äî which we‚Äôd had in this country for 230 years ‚Äî citing the intelligence community‚Äôs bullshit new report, which ODNI and CIA clearly held back until the very moment Trump was certified President so his very first hours begin with him immediately tarred as illegitimate and possibly criminal.

BREAKING üö® The US State Department has just placed all 30 full-time staff at the Global Engagement Center‚Äôs remnant known as R-FIMI on leave, eliminated all 50 full-time staff positions and delivered a notice to Congress ending R-FIMI‚Äôs existence and $65 million in funding üßµüëá

This historic development today was made possible by @SecRubio and Acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy @DarrenJBeattie, as part of a complete restructuring of the State Department‚Äôs activities and capacities to prevent the abuses and weaponization of the past.

@SecRubio @DarrenJBeattie The development today is the State Department‚Äôs initiation of a RIF (Reduction In Force) that will permanently end the positions at GEC / R-FIMI, so there is no more reshuffling of positions or simple renamings of the office to carry out the same malign censorship efforts.

It‚Äôs important to understand the relationship between USAID external policies and immigration & refugee internal policies.  
  
Remittances from migrants & refugees in the US provides more money to the home networks USAID sponsors in target countries than USAID itself üßµ

2/ Remittances are when a migrant or refugee has money or makes money here in the US, and then sends money back to friends and relatives in their home country.  
  
So, for example, Ukraine refugees who flee then have their lives paid for here by aid programs will send cash back home

3/ And indeed, this is one of the main reasons we import masses of refugees from conflict zones or war zones as part of a Pentagon effort to fund one side of a war or paramilitary struggle. The refugees‚Äô network back home is one we want to financially capacity-build

Straight out of a Benzpill lecture, the piece begins by lauding how wonderful Telegram is for (CIA-backed) rent-a-riots in Belarus, Iran, & in Russia itself. It applauded Telegram‚Äôs 2014-2020 era bc Pavel never gave in to the foreign gov‚Äôts the CIA was using Telegram to topple.
