Northwestern University President Michael Schill said Thursday he was resigning, marking the latest university leader to step down during a tumultuous period in higher education.

Like many of its peers, [Northwestern has faced pressure](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/northwestern-funding-freeze-trump-85d49da2?mod=article_inline) from the Trump administration over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests on campus following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks in Israel.

The Midwestern university has had $790 million in federal research money frozen, affecting hundreds of scientific projects, including clinical trials with patients on lifesaving medicine.

In a message to the campus on Thursday, Schill, 66 years old, said that after three years in the job, he had decided now was the right time to step aside for a new leader. “It is critical that we continue to protect the University’s research mission and excellence while preserving academic freedom, integrity, and independence,” he said.

The announcement comes before students return to the Evanston, Ill., campus for the fall quarter. Schill will stay in the job until an interim president is named, and then join the law school faculty after a sabbatical.

Schill has twice gone [before a congressional committee](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/congressional-committee-takes-aim-at-leaders-of-ucla-rutgers-northwestern-a6949052?mod=article_inline), including in a closed-door August session, to answer questions about antisemitism on campus. “None of us were prepared for what we saw after Oct. 7, and you have my commitment that we will do what is necessary to combat antisemitism,” Schill testified in May 2024, during a public hearing with other university leaders.

Early in the Trump administration, Northwestern appeared on a list of 10 universities identified as initial targets by the federal [Task Force to Combat Antisemitism](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/anti-semitism-task-force-who-247c234e?mod=article_inline). The university drew national attention when school leaders in spring 2024 cut a deal with pro-Palestinian students to end an on-campus encampment.

In his Thursday message, Schill said the university has “faced serious and often painful challenges” and acknowledged that “difficult problems remain, particularly at the federal level.”

Since the federal funding freeze, Northwestern—which has an endowment of $14.3 billion—has kept research going using university funds. Scientists this spring and summer wondered for how long the stopgap could last. The university said in July that financial pressures meant around 425 jobs would be eliminated.

Northwestern is among a number of leading universities that have had hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding cut by the Trump administration. The federal government has reached settlements with some to restore the funding, including a [more than $200 million deal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-reaches-deal-with-trump-administration-to-restore-federal-funds-2e3cfdc6?mod=article_inline) with Columbia University, and a [$50 million agreement](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/brown-trump-deal-federal-funds-research-50-million-25b1e8bd?mod=article_inline) with Brown University.

Some faculty on Thursday expressed surprise at the resignation.

“I think there’s a lot of suspicion and mistrust and fear of what led to this resignation,” said Elizabeth Shakman Hurd, the chair of Northwestern’s religious studies department. “And apprehension about the future and what this signals in terms of where the board sees us heading.”

A group of Northwestern parents and alumni who have criticized the university for not doing more to protect Jewish students welcomed the resignation and urged the board to continue making changes. “President Schill’s resignation is a necessary first step, but it cannot be the last,” said Lisa Fields, a parent and chair of the Coalition Against Antisemitism at Northwestern.

Schill faced challenges on campus even before the campus protests and tension with the Trump administration. In his first year, [he fired head football coach Pat Fitzgerald](https://www.wsj.com/sports/football/northwestern-coach-pat-fitzgerald-fired-bf2a57d8?mod=article_inline) over a hazing scandal on the football team, just days after initially issuing a short suspension. “The decision to originally suspend Coach Fitzgerald was mine and mine alone, as is the decision to part ways with him,” Schill said at the time, in July 2023.

Fitzgerald later sued for wrongful termination, and the two sides settled in August for undisclosed terms. In announcing the settlement, Northwestern said it found no evidence that any players reported the hazing to Fitzgerald or that he condoned it in any way.

Schill came into the Northwestern presidency in September 2022 after the initial hire for the role, Rebecca Blank, [was diagnosed with cancer](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/northwestern-president-elect-rebecca-blank-steps-down-after-revealing-cancer-diagnosis-11657557707?&mod=article_inline). Blank, a former chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and economics professor at Northwestern, died less than a year later.

Before joining Northwestern, Schill served as president of the University of Oregon and dean of the University of Chicago Law School.
