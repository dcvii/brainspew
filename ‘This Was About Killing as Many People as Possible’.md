The shots from the Basij came as the crowd was already scattering. As he ran, Ali thought, *Why are you shooting at us as we are running away?* But there was no time to think about it then; he just needed to escape home.

The man who told me this has just left Iran. I have known him for two years, but for his own and his family’s safety he can’t be identified, so I am calling him Ali. He and his wife are in a neighboring country for now, where they fled last week, after the protests in Iran were crushed by Ali Khameini’s regime in a violent crackdown that has taken at least 6,000 lives—a number that after all the injured and missing are accounted for [could climb to over 20,000](https://www.en-hrana.org/day-thirty-of-the-protests-from-internet-disruptions-to-the-pursuit-of-the-injured/). Both are young professionals who intend to return home to Iran, but they need the internet, still cut off in Iran, to do their jobs. And they need to breathe.

Ali first joined the protests on January 8. By then, they had grown to a million people. He and his wife, whom I’ll call Roya, live in one of Iran’s bigger cities, and were not activists or dissidents. “I had never been to a protest before,” Ali told me. But he felt a responsibility to take a stand. And, for the first time in Ali’s life, the prospects for a change in the regime appeared hopeful.

“After the 12-day war with Israel, the regime seemed weak. They didn’t feel as scary,” Ali said. “We are okay materially—not like some people in Iran. But we wanted change and wanted to be a part of making it happen.”

All those hopes were destroyed when the protests were crushed with cold-blooded killings by Iran’s Basij paramilitary forces. While Ali, sensing the danger, had left the protests before the worst of the violence, he saw enough to give a chilling picture of the regime’s retaliation and its aftermath. Some of what Ali relates, from his own experience and those of other protesters he knew well, echoes stories told in the intermittent, distorted phone recordings that have leaked out from behind Iran’s internet blockade. But hearing these descriptions from someone you know, as I know Ali, evokes another layer of terror altogether.

Ali went out on the night of January 8 with his wife and three relatives at around 7:30 p.m. to be in place for organizers’ 8 p.m. call to march. The family took precautions, donning masks and leaving their cell phones at home so they would leave no incriminating digital footprints in the city center that evening. They found pockets of people lurking around a main square. Ali told me that he felt relaxed, but Roya, who had been to protests before, kept looking back to see if police were following them.

The first person to break into chants that night on the square was an elderly woman in a chador. She shouted “Death to the dictator!” as she punched her fist into the air. Others joined in. People who had been lurking in small crowds, gauging the situation, ventured forth, with the groups joining together to form one snaking mass that began to move together through the town. Ali estimates there were thousands of people in the group. This was just one rallying point; Ali believes there were other demonstrations in the city.

“Some people seemed to know what they were doing,” Ali said. “There were men breaking CCTV cameras.”

A pack of anti-riot police on bikes zoomed away from the square as the chants grew louder, apparently in retreat. “Death to Khamenei!” was one. “This is the last battle—Pahlavi will return!” was another—a reference to Reza, the son of Mohammad Pahlavi, the shah deposed in Iran’s Islamic Revolution of 1979.  
As the crowd moved forward, it encountered a minibus belonging to the Basij in flames. A group of protesters pushed it along. One hung on outside the driver’s side, holding the steering wheel through the window with one hand, flashing a victory sign in the air with another.

“At that point I thought, *We’ve got the city! They’ve lost control*,” Ali said. He was far from alone in thinking this. Cars were honking. Fireworks were being set off. Then things turned much uglier.

Protesters approached a government building, setting the gate on fire and pushing their way onto the compound. At that point, Ali heard shots and assumed they were just canisters of tear gas as people around him began choking. His wife had come prepared with lemon-soaked cloth and was ministering to a few people when they heard the roar of motorbikes approaching from behind.

At the back of the crowd and not having entered the compound, Ali and his wife were able to take off down an alley, and someone let them into a building. About 25 people squeezed in with them. Troops fired tear gas into the courtyard.

“When I opened my eyes for a second to decide what to do next, I saw a man full of bullet holes lying in a puddle of his own blood.” He had been shot outside in the demonstration, then stumbled into the courtyard and collapsed. Ali describes the man’s wounds as a gory red sash running diagonally across his body, from stomach to shoulder, gruesome wounds the likes of which Ali had never seen before and wishes no one ever would see. The wounds came from small metal pellets—the same kind that were [used to blind](https://www.aao.org/young-ophthalmologists/yo-info/article/ocular-injuries-in-iranian-protesters) hundreds of protesters in 2022 —but there were so many of them fired into the man that his flesh was badly torn.

“In a split second,” Ali said, “we all raced in panic to the top of the building, fleeing for our lives, preparing to run rooftop to rooftop to get away, when someone shouted that we should not leave the injured man behind to die.”

“This was not about keeping back crowds,” Ali said. “This was about killing as many people as possible.”

Somehow in the mayhem, a nurse among the protesters taking refuge got to the wounded man, brought him inside an apartment, and tended to him. It weighs heavily on Ali that he does not know how this story ended.

Ali’s mother-in-law heard a girl outside the building that night pleading, “Don’t shoot, don’t shoot me.” Then there were gunshots. Then silence.

The family waited 45 minutes on the rooftop before heading home through deserted parks and back alleys, avoiding all main roads. It was after midnight and quiet. When they got home, their phone lines were dead, cell service was cut off, and there was no internet.

The shutdown of the internet indicated that the stakes were rising. It meant that Iranians would be largely cut off from each others’ experience, and made it clear there would be further retaliation from the regime. The shutdown itself spoke volumes about how limitless the retaliation could be. “The regime just pulled the plug,” Ali said.

Still, Ali went out the next night, a Friday, with a friend; his wife and relatives stayed home this time. Moving along his same route, the crowds were thinner and had not come together into a rally like the previous day. There were relatively small groups of people at intersections preparing to march, but they were not organized, and there was no chanting.

This time the Basij were bolder, and shortly after Ali arrived, they came tearing down the wrong side of the street. There was no provocation, and the scene was less a rally than a gathering. As they saw the Basij coming, the protesters, including Ali and his friends, turned and ran. Nonetheless, the paramilitaries started shooting, spraying people on each corner with shotgun pellets as they tried to escape. Ali got hit in the lower legs, but he was wearing heavy boots and socks, so the pellets didn’t penetrate and he was just bruised, not seriously hurt. He heard the sound of the metal pellets hitting glass all around him as he darted past shops to get to his car.

Feeling like things were about to get more violent, Ali went back to his car. It was when he drove toward home that he understood the regime was out to kill.

“I passed four Toyota trucks like the Taliban had,” Ali said, “each with a mounted machine gun and four men with AK-47s pointing toward the crowds that had gathered. One fired a warning shot into the air from the machine gun. I have never heard such a noise, and it lit up the sky like a firework.”

“It was just like ‘ *Squid Game*,’ as if the more they killed, the more money they’d earn.”

To Ali, the machine guns sent to confront what were already diminishing protests was a signal from the regime that it had passed the point of simply stopping the protests. “This was not about keeping back crowds,” Ali said. “This was about killing as many people as possible.”

A man Ali knows was hunted, chased down an alley that night by one of the regime’s henchmen firing an AK-47. It seemed that for the paramilitaries, Ali told me, “It was just like *Squid Game*, as if the more they killed, the more money they’d earn.”

Ali’s friend survived and went back to the alley the next morning to find the spent bullets. He took one that he says was meant for him and made it into a necklace.

From that point on, Ali and his wife stayed home, lying low. There were troops at every junction in their city in the days after the protests, a sort of martial law. But even staying home was not safe. Ali heard stories of police tracking down protesters and coming for them after the fact in the following days. Some got automated messages from the authorities, a signal that the government had their numbers and knew who they were. Ali and Roya believe that leaving their phones at home saved them.

With the internet shut down, Ali got news from satellite TV (while the regime seems to have confiscated satellite dishes in Tehran, it did not in Ali’s city) and phone calls from friends on landlines. People quickly figured out how to speak in code. As far as Ali was able to tell, the protests petered out in the following two nights, as the web of repression tightened. In the last few days, though, with Iran’s regime seemingly satisfied that it had regained control, the police presence has been lighter. Ali and Roya found that leaving Iran was surprisingly easy; authorities did not even check their phones as they got on a flight out of Tehran last week.

What stands out among this brutality, Ali said, is that from what he saw on satellite TV and what he heard from people who had seen the bodies, the majority of the wounded and dead appeared to have been shot in the back or the back of the head—which shows they were shot as they were retreating and not charging toward police. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a U.S.-based group that monitors Iran and released widely respected estimates, has confirmed 6,126 deaths in the protests. But that does not include the more than 17,000 deaths still under investigation or the more than 11,000 serious injuries.

Ali, though, suspects that all the estimates he has seen are an undercount. From what he saw, the bodies counted at demonstrations are just a portion of the deaths. Ali believes that the regime is trying to quickly and secretly dispose of bodies to keep them from being counted. He has heard that some families have managed to keep bodies and bury them on the grounds of their homes, so there is no official record. And other victims have just disappeared after arrests.

“It’s not just the body bags that are significant. People are dying at home too. It’s too dangerous to seek medical help,” Ali says. He explains that the wounded have been snatched from hospitals and people have been questioned and even detained for buying bandages and disinfectant in pharmacies.

“A friend told me that one night, as some wounded people were dragging themselves into a hospital, the receptionist leapt outside to help them in. He too was shot, killed as he was helping the injured inside.”

Disrespecting those already dead, Ali says, should be the final blow for true Muslims. Relatives have been forced to pay thousands of dollars to claim the bodies of their loved ones, a thuggish practice that Iranians have come to refer to as the “bullet price.” But Ali said that the extortion is not the worst of it.

“I heard that in the town of Najafabad some people stole the bodies of their loved ones out of the town morgue,” Ali said. “They buried them respectfully according to tradition, only to have the regime dig them up at night, pile them in a massive garbage truck, and drive around town before heading to a mass grave somewhere.”

Ali and his wife point out that Muslims believe it is only when a person is buried that he finally finds peace, and to dig someone out of the grave is considered the ultimate disrespect. They point to a Persian curse reserved for one’s worst enemy.

“ *Gur be gur beshid* ”: May you be displaced from your grave.

The stories of brutality were carried out by a regime claiming to represent God on earth, proclaiming to hold some moral high ground—that makes the violence even more sickening, if that is possible. Ali’s wife said the people of Iran are not blind to this hypocrisy. “Believe me, you do not see one mullah on the streets these days,” Roya said. “They would not be safe.”

For the moment, the protests have been suppressed. Ali told me that without aid, there was no chance of success. “We have done all we can, but we can’t fight men with machine guns,” he said.

Ali and his wife told me that they thought President Donald Trump should follow through with his promise of support. Iran’s regime has shown itself to be willing to slaughter as many as it takes to ensure its own survival. But Ali said that this uprising, far more than those of 2019 and 2022, marks a transformation in Iranians’ attitudes. They say they have heard quite a few people in recent months express their willingness at this point to die rather than suffer further indignities at the hands of the regime.

“I told that older woman in a chador at the protests—the first one to start chanting—she was brave to be out with us,” Ali said. “She replied, ‘ We have only one life. Let them take mine. They have already taken everything else.’ ”
