*The absence of humility, integrity, and open-mindedness isn’t just a moral failure. It’s a methodological one. Originally published on 12.16.25 in the [Chronicle of Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/article/are-bad-researchers-bad-people?).*

The great naturalist Charles Darwin set a “golden rule” for his study of nature. Whenever he encountered information that ran counter to his ideas, he would make a note of it “without fail and at once.” Why? Because, as Darwin [wrote](https://www.online-literature.com/darwin/autobiography-of-darwin/7/) in his autobiography, “such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favourable ones.”

Turning his remarkable powers of observation on himself, Darwin discerned that he was more likely to remember confirmatory evidence than findings that refuted his ideas. His golden rule protected him against what we now call confirmation bias — a tendency to favor evidence that validates one’s preexisting beliefs.

Darwin was practicing *intellectual humility*. He was aware of his cognitive biases and open to correction. This disposition is one of a suite of epistemic virtues: traits that contribute to intellectual flourishing and accountable belief formation.

Such virtues are part of a larger [project](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27902913) on intellectual character developed by philosopher Ernest Sosa, a professor of philosophy at Rutgers University. Sosa introduced the notion of “virtue epistemology” in a1980 paper, “The Raft and the Pyramid.” It’s a complex analysis that, along with his subsequent writing, examines knowledge through the lens of intellectual virtue and highlights the idea of a responsible knower.

Taking its inspiration from the virtue ethics of the Greco-Roman tradition — the practice of ethical decision-making and eventual action — virtue epistemology focuses on traits beneficial to intellectual inquiry.

In addition to epistemic humility, other virtues, as elaborated by Robert C. Roberts and W. Jay Wood in their 2007 book, *Intellectual Virtues*, include open-mindedness, love of knowledge, and generosity (sharing intellectual goods), alongside such traits as “intellectual courage” (willingness to consider difficult, unpopular, or counterintuitive ideas) and “intellectual firmness” (the ability to balance once’s belief against letting go in the face of compelling evidence).

*“* Virtue” has been largely absent from ongoing discussions about how to cultivate productive conversation and debate on college campuses. Center stage has instead been taken by concepts like [viewpoint](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-57821-006) [pluralism](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phc3.70021) and [political diversity](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/political-diversity-will-improve-social-psychological-science1/A54AD4878AED1AFC8BA6AF54A890149F), which have been demonstrated to reduce confirmation bias, enhance creativity, and improve problem-solving. More controversially, the [hiring](https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-are-there-so-few-conservative-professors) of more conservative and heterodox professors has also been widely discussed.

Those approaches are necessary, but the epistemic virtues also have a role. They don’t focus on an individual’s ideological or political coloration. Nor do they concern an individual’s cognitive endowment, such as intelligence, problem-solving ability, or pre-existing knowledge. Rather, they concern character traits. “A person can be extremely intellectually ‘gifted’ while also being intellectually arrogant, careless, or lazy,” according to philosopher Joseph Baehr at Loyola Marymount University. “Conversely, a person of mediocre natural intelligence can be highly curious, open, careful, and thorough in her thinking.”

### Practical Implications

The epistemic virtues have practical implications for research, teaching, uncovering pseudoscience, and reducing political tensions.

Psychologist William O’Donohue at the University of Reno and colleagues [contend](https://behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BPv45_ODONOHUE.pdf) that research in their field has been held back by investigators’ failure to design and conduct experiments and report data “in an epistemically virtuous manner.” For example, the unvirtuous investigator may deliberately shorten the duration of intervention trials so that the results reflect short-term benefits that may fade over a longer interval.

Virtue is also slighted when investigators ignore the impact of attrition. Losing subjects midway through a clinical trial can create an imbalance between treatment groups or between treatment groups and the control, thereby making the final sample unrepresentative of the original participant pool. Another lapse: emphasizing results that are statistically significant but so small that they have little clinical relevance. “As I see it, good research requires good character,” O’Donohue told me.

Encouraging students and the public to be skeptical of pseudoscience draws on the core epistemic virtues.Intellectual humility, for example, is [associated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37358543/) with reduced belief in the discredited causal link between vaccines and autism. Data also show that [cognitive reflection](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making/article/reflective-thinking-predicts-lower-conspiracy-beliefs-a-metaanalysis/73D77DBC333AA2C1778D8F71A1A918FF), a form of intellectual integrity, can equip people to override their gut reactions and detect the logical fallacies inherent in most conspiracy theories, which typically involve secret plots by powerful and sinister groups.

Virtue epistemology benefits both the scientist and the skeptic, according to philosopher Massimo Pigliucci of the City University of New York. “It’s a way of thinking that recognizes the human nature of scientific knowledge,” he told me. “Because research can never be a purely neutral view from nowhere, our focus should be on the kind of practices that make it possible to arrive at the best approximation to the truth.”

In the political realm, University of Alabama psychologist Shauna Bowes and colleagues [found](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656620300805) that intellectually humble individuals are less likely to view themselves as different from members of the opposite political party or to consider their ideological opponents immoral and unlikeable. They are open and respectful in the face of disagreement. In [other](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-73539-001) work, Bowes and her team found that individuals with higher intellectual humility were less susceptible to confirmation bias when evaluating arguments about global warming and gun control..

### Hopeful Signs

Efforts to instill epistemic virtues are gaining popularity. Ron Ritchhart of Harvard University [advises](https://pz.harvard.edu/who-we-are/people/ron-ritchhart) fellow teachers to manifest intellectual virtues in their own teaching and research by displaying curiosity and intellectual humility and giving a fair hearing to multiple perspectives. They can also explore the lives of intellectually virtuous exemplars from history, literature, film, and contemporary life.

Pigliucci of City College has created a “checklist for the virtuous skeptic” for his students and for general audiences. Among the questions included on the checklist, he told me, are, “Did I carefully consider my opponent’s arguments and not dismiss them out of hand? Did I interpret what my opponent said in the most charitable way possible before mounting a response? Did I seriously entertain the possibility that I might be wrong?”

In 2013, Jason Baehr and Steve Porter, a philosopher at Biola University, launched a charter [middle school](https://www.ivalongbeach.org/governance-overview/) — admission is by lottery — called the Intellectual Virtues Academy in Long Beach, California. The Templeton Foundation was a major supporter. Teachers in all courses, including literature, history, and science, [foster](https://intellectualvirtues.org/why-should-we-educate-for-intellectual-virtues-2-2/) nine “master virtues,” generally similar to the epistemic virtues enumerated by Roberts and Wood. In 2016, the two philosophers established a [high school](https://www.ivahigh.org/apply/awards-and-recognition/) in Long Beach, California, also called Intellectual Virtues Academy. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and receives some support from California.

Although epistemic virtues have been little discussed outside the bounds of philosophy, scientists have always tacitly embraced them — they are the stuff of research ethics, after all. But all forms of scholarship and debate can be strengthened, and made more collegial, when students and citizens – determined truth-seekers all — aspire towards intellectual responsibility.
