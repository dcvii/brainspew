Israel launched more attacks against Iran, hours after wide-ranging strikes on the country’s nuclear program and military leadership. [The head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/salami-head-of-iran-s-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-killed-in-israel-s-attack-Q3i3is8ufPHTmq1qjt6C) was killed and dozens of targets were hit in an operation that pushes the region into a new conflict with uncertain consequences.

President Trump [told The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/trump-to-wsj-u-s-was-aware-of-israel-s-plans-to-attack-iran-4613AzRhb9WHfBFytL8Y) on Friday that he was read in on Israel’s plans to attack Iran: "Heads-up? It wasn’t a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on." Earlier, he urged Iran’s leadership to make a deal “before there is nothing left,” saying that Israel had access to lethal military equipment manufactured by the U.S. and that “they know how to use it.”

Two hundred jet fighters wrapped up the first wave of the attack, Israel said. Iranian Supreme Leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/iran-s-supreme-leader-vows-to-retaliate-against-israel-Z5vkD0S11rCnMH5gOAwS) said Israel “should expect severe punishment” for the strikes. Israel said it had started shooting down drones launched in a retaliation by Iran.

Here’s what to know:

IRGC commander Hossein Salami and [two other generals](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/who-was-killed-in-israel-s-attack-on-iran--iIivjeOgkXmjpwcrgCAG) were killed, punching a hole in Tehran’s military leadership.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military operation [would last “as many days as it takes.”](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/netanyahu-says-rising-lion-operation-will-last-as-many-days-as-it-takes--awFq7ykuEj4Mq9D4i0gw) Israel planned [14 days of operations](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/israeli-operation-likely-won-t-be-over-for-many-days-official-says-VLPlNDNuYrpxTyJxm7l2), a senior Israeli official said.

Long before Israel’s attacks, agents [smuggled explosive drones](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/israel-smuggled-explosive-drones-into-iran-to-target-weapons-W4wGtigsmPdWbgIJJep2) and other guided weapons into Iran, an official said.

Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz [decided Monday](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/israel-decided-on-monday-to-attack-iran-TEUwN902QJAQQayjlZcq) that the attack would begin Friday local time, an official said.

President Trump told The Wall Street Journal that he and his team were aware of Israel’s plans to attack Iran.

Asked what kind of heads-up the U.S. got ahead of the attack, Trump said in a brief phone interview on Friday morning, "Heads-up? It wasn’t a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on."

The president said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and plans to speak with him again Friday. He called the operation "a very successful attack, to put it mildly."

"I told the other side, I said, you have 60 days to make the deal. On the 61st day, they attacked. Today is 61 actually, and it was a very successful attack," Trump said.

"They should have made a deal and they still can make a deal while they have something left— they still can," he added.

Trump said the markets would respond positively if Iran's nuclear capacity was diminished.

"I think ultimately, it would be great for the market because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon," he said. "It will be great for the market—should be the greatest thing ever for the market. Iran won't have a nuclear weapon that was a great threat to humanity."

## Latest Updates

A sustained surge in oil prices is likely to complicate the U.S. fight against inflation. A $10-a-barrel increase would boost year-over-year growth in the Consumer Price Index by 0.5 percentage points, cutting into consumer spending and GDP growth, said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Such an increase “would reduce the level of U.S. real GDP in Q4 of this year by 0.1% to 0.2% as the hit to consumer spending is larger than the boost to US domestic investment in mining, shafts and wells as \[oil\] production,” Sweet said.

U.S. benchmark crude rose by more than $5 a barrel, or 8%, Friday morning. Inflation has come down markedly from 40-year highs in 2022. It remained tame in the latest May reading, defying fears that the impact of President Trump’s tariffs would start to show a rise in prices.

Some residents of Tehran said they were driving out of the city to spend a few days in smaller towns and villages, fearing that the capital could be struck again by Israel.

A 42-year-old woman who was shaken awake by the predawn blasts said she was looking for a ride to join her husband and son who were already in a small town for a long weekend getaway. She said internet restrictions imposed by the government were making it hard to get news about the situation, adding to her anxiety.

The Israeli military said it inflicted "significant damage" on Iran's Natanz enrichment site. The IDF said in a statement Friday afternoon that it had hit the underground complex at Natanz, which includes a multilevel enrichment hall containing centrifuges, electrical rooms and additional support infrastructure. "We struck the underground area and targeted additional critical infrastructure on-site that enables its continued functioning. We inflicted significant damage on this site," the military spokesperson said.

There have long been questions about how much damage Israel could do to Iran's two main enrichment facilities. Tehran has been able to get the sites back up and running swiftly following previous large-scale sabotage acts which it has blamed on Israel. It is unclear from the statement how complete the damage was to the vast underground areas which were initially designed to house more than 100,000 centrifuges.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to speak with President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his office said.

Starting last night, Netanyahu held discussions with other world leaders including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron. “The leaders showed understanding for Israel's defense needs in the face of the Iranian threat of annihilation,” Netanyahu’s office said.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the Israeli attacks as “reckless, aggressive and lawless.”

“The international community must put an end to Israeli banditry that targets global and regional stability,” he said.

The majority of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps air force leadership was killed by an Israeli military strike, according to defense minister Israel Katz.

The group were convening in an underground bunker, the minister said in a statement. Israeli intelligence determined that overnight, senior air force leaders were in an underground meeting preparing to attack Israel, the Israeli military said in a statement.

Fighter jets struck the location, killing Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the air force. Along with him, Israel killed the commander of Iran’s UAV force and the commander of aerial command, the military said.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron each affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself and ensure its security.

Iran's nuclear program presents "a serious threat to the entire region, and particularly to the state of Israel," Merz wrote on X after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

French President Emmanuel Macron separately said, “France has repeatedly condemned Iran’s ongoing nuclear program.” He wrote on X, “To avoid jeopardizing the stability of the entire region, I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to de-escalate.”

The European Commission called for restraint after Israel attacked Iran’s nuclear and military sites. European Union foreign-policy chief Kaja Kallas held talks with Israel’s foreign minister early Friday, and the EU executive is in close contact with both sides, a commission spokesperson said.

“We do urge all parties to exercise restraint to avoid a broader regional conflict because no one—no one—stands to gain from more war in the region,” the spokesperson said.
