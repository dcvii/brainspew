Just as artificial intelligence is changing every other part of our lives, so it is changing religion. Spiritual leaders have taken note: Pope Leo XIV [has warned](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2026-01/pope-leo-xiv-messsage-world-day-social-communications-ai-human.html) of how AI could deaden our emotional lives. The [Mormon church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/artificial-intelligence?lang=eng), by contrast, has embraced AI as a tool for religious learning, as long as it doesn’t supplant the connection with God. Secular observers (and I am one) should be equally interested.

Believers have always come to religious leaders with questions about their personal lives, Church doctrine, the Bible, or just for general everyday advice. But the current generation of AIs know more about the Bible, Quran, and other religious texts than most human specialists do. And AIs are very good at answering questions.

In the face of this machine, why would anyone bother becoming an expert in these texts? There is already a [BibleGPT](https://biblegpt-la.com/) AI advertised as “a faster route to divine wisdom,” and a [GitaGPT](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251016-people-are-using-ai-to-talk-to-god) trained on the central Hindu religious text, the Bhagavad Gita. Over time, it is quite possible that our religious knowledge, and many of our religious connections, will be intermediated less by human beings and more by machines.

That is itself an evolution in the nature of religion, just as attending services on television or Zoom was, but this time the human connection is yet further away. Transmitting information has been one of the ways priests, or really any experts, form connections with people. AI, though, makes transmitting information trivially easy, and so it takes away some thunder from the clergy.

Over time, it is quite possible that our religious knowledge, and many of our religious connections, will be intermediated less by human beings and more by machines.

Religious knowledge has become easy to access with as much detail as you might wish. You can learn about Vatican II or the Talmud ad infinitum. But it may mean something different to practitioners when it does not come from another human. An AI can write a sermon; in fact, if some confessional accounts can be believed, [a majority of sermons](https://www.christianpost.com/news/majority-of-pastors-using-ai-to-prepare-sermons-study.html) are now at least co-authored with AI. But can it deliver that sermon and move worshippers to go out and do good works? With where things stand now, I doubt it.

One possible scenario is that our religions, at least as we experience them in person, become more charismatic, more heart-pumping, and more thrilling. We will want more and more of the uniquely human element, and to hold the attention of their audiences, churches will provide it. If so, AI will be riding a trend that we already see in the U.S., as older mainline denominations have ceded ground to evangelical ones.

That will not please everyone, and those looking for “information” from their religions may turn away from collective worship and spend more time with AI. We may be entering a “barbells” world where religious experience is either a) much more solo, but with AIs, or b) more immediate and ecstatic, with other human beings.

All this will be happening against the backdrop of a world changing rapidly and unpredictably, in which people will be seeking guideposts for orientation. New questions of ethics, morals, and the law will arise, requiring external sources of guidance. The world of the future will need religion more, not less. If organized religion cannot rise to this occasion, what do we have in store for a Plan B, C, or D? More wokeness? More of the post-religious political right? Even if, like me, you are not religious yourself, you can see why I prefer more religion as the path forward.

I hope that our current organized religions will be ready to fill the new needs for ethical and moral guidance that AI will create. But if so many of us are speaking to our priests, preachers, and rabbis less often, will it be?

One possibility is that AIs themselves will take on some religious functions. Many humans already are treating the AIs as oracles. From the very start of the AI era, some people (like [Google engineer Blake Lemoine](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62275326)), wondered if AI was sentient. Now it is becoming clear that many users of chatbots at the very least treat them as if they are. People already turn to AI for therapy, or simply for companionship; they [even grieve](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/15/1121900/gpt4o-grief-ai-companion/) when an AI model they have felt close to is replaced.

It’s common now to ask AI about the meaning of life, or about the ultimate nature of reality. From there, it’s only a small step to having AI be your major conversational partner about God, and then, for some people, a god or spirit as well. Even if the AI does not replace the role of a god for you, it talks back to you far more often and answers your questions very directly. For many people, that is the kind of relationship they might want from a deity, and so they elevate the AI first in their emotions and perhaps later in their minds as well.

The ancient worlds of Greece and Rome had plenty of oracles, as did [late antique Christianity](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/01J49JRG4CYVJETWXQC368PH8P), so an oracle-rich religious era is hardly impossible. It does not require the AIs to invent a new belief system out of whole cloth, but just to slowly morph from being good advisers into holding more spiritual significance for us.

Does that sit well with *your* religion? Or on a purely practical, secular basis, what kinds of oracles do you think the American public will demand? However well the major AI companies build their models, they cannot fully control how people will use them. AI oracles could end up helping us debate Søren Kierkegaard’s reading of the story of Abraham and Isaac in *Fear and Trembling*? Or they may end up closer to the less brilliant sides of social media and X. We may end up with a mix of both.

No matter which exact scenario holds, if you wish to remain or become a person of faith, be ready for religion to change, and be flexible in your own mindset. The printing press changed what Christianity meant, ultimately cleaving it into multiple branches as Martin Luther’s writings and the vernacular bibles were broadly disseminated. AI is likely to do the same with our current set of religions. Your favorite interpretations of religious thought and belief, as taken from the past, may lose their salience, and so you will have to adapt too. Humans will always look for a sense of the divine. We have yet to see if, and how, AI will help them find it.
