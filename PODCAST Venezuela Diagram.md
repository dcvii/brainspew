Tom Barnett here. The date is 15 December 2025. This is the audio version of today's post entitled Venezuela Diagram. Subtitle, The Dunro Doctrine Seeks Its Mini Bang. As always, I like to remind this as a reader-supported publication, I give it all away for free, but could really use and will gladly accept your help.

0:53

Warships slice through Caribbean swells like orcas scenting blood. CIA leaks seep out in calculated drips, each one a needling jab. Marco Rubio playing neocon whisperer on Truth Social anoints Edmundo Gonzalez as Venezuela's rightful president. Donald Trump blends that Reagan-esque moral clarity with TR's sneering muscle, scripting a show of forces ripped from the Panama 89 playbook.

1:34

No endless occupation, no trillion-dollar quagmire, just a spectacular mini-bang to shatter Nicolas Maduro's regime. Trump's tweets write themselves. Folks, big news from the Caribbean. Venezuela's loser Maduro is done. Gone. Poof! Rocket emoji. Explosion emoji. No more prison dumps flooding our borders with Tren de Aragua psychos. Eight million invaders from my maximum pressure genius? Biden's fault.

2:18

He let him in. I fixed it. Warships, best ships, beautiful. Sliced through narco waves like butter. CIA, greatest hits ever. Total theater. Rubio, smart guy. Crowned Gonzalez, rightful president on truth social. Chevron, oil gushing north already. Bigger than Saudi folks. Starves China, Russia, Iran. Bad deals they made. I end them. Dunro Doctrine. Monroe on steroids.

2:54

No boots, no quagmire. Mini bang. Perfect. Generals defected like rats. Protests crushed. Collectivos. Backers bailed. Putin, busy. Ukraine, losing. Xi, Taiwan, scared. Grenada, Panama style, not Iraq grind. I promised. Migrant flows, managed. Jobs for Americans first. Malay, Bukalé, clones everywhere. Hemisphere, mine. One trillion dollar boom. Venezuela fuels it.

3:33

Nobel, I gotta get it this time or no respect. MAGA wins big. Makes Americas great. Trump delivers. Hashtag Donro. Hashtag Maduro. Gone. Hashtag MAGA 2025. best case we're talking regime topple theater cyber spikes precision strikes naval showdowns sanctions that starve the beast until it implodes goal End the export of migrants, narcos,

4:13

and raw misery that's poisoned our hemisphere for a decade plus. Boot Russia, China, Cuba, Iran from our backyard while unlocking Venezuela's oil jackpot. This is the Dunro Doctrine firing on all cylinders. Monroics reborn with Trump's brass knuckle flare. Still, that's only one of the possible stories to be told here.



I've crunched it down to a clean two-by-two matrix. Regime resilience, Maduro's military criminal glue holds firm, or fracturing under pressure, crossed with external leverage. Backers like Moscow, Beijing, Havana, and Tehran digging in deeper, or cutting their losses and bailing. Let's unpack each quadrant of this XY scenario grid in full. Likelihood, tactics, outcomes, pitfalls, historical rhymes.


Quadrant one, low resilience, Maduro regime, plus strong external leverage, outside backers. We'll call this one spoiler overreach, The historical analogy, Haiti, 1994, Operation Uphold Democracy. Maduro's internals crack wide. Generals defecting, colectivos fracturing, mass protests overwhelming, riot squads, economy and freefall hyperinflation. Backers like China cling initially, arms drops, cash infusions, but implosion forces retreats.



Too toxic, no strategic ROI to be found. The U.S. accelerates with pro-democracy airlifts to opposition enclaves, targeted bounties, and border safe zones for defectors. Regime collapses in weeks, with Chavez whisked to Moscow by Putin. At that point, backers ghost like rats. Handover? Chaotic. Knife fights in Caracas. Refugee spikes short-term, but oil flows north fast under emergency U.S. oversight. We inherit significant stabilization mess, but gain control over migration and drug trafficking. The U.S. is stuck there for more than a year, training new police and reformed military, but it's tolerable. Venezuelan echo of Haiti? Bigger scale, oil sweetener offsets the babysitting. Win? Backers exposed as paper hemispheric tigers. Pitfall? No regional anchors means quagmire light.

7:17

Knife fight drags without Brazil-Colombia muscle. This is an exclusively American show. Quadrant 2, upper right corner of the XY grid. Low resilience Maduro regime plus weak external leverage by backers. We'll call this one Clean Victory Cascade. The historical analogy, Grenada 1983, Operation Urgent Fury. Jackpot. Internals shatter. Betrayals cascade. Protests topple checkpoints.

8:00

Backers seeing zero ROI and toxic optics abandon ship pre-collapse. Trump's masterstroke. Minimal enabler strikes. Drones on comms towers. Cyber to freeze regime assets. Then Gonzalez declares victory from Miami. U.S. airlifts legitimize inbound leadership. Oil packs signed day one. Chevron floods in. Labor corridors open up to managed inflows. Minerals locked up for U.S. tech. The domino effect?

8:43

Cuba and Nicaragua wobble. Chavismo ghosts the entire region. The general vibe? Our hemisphere reboots as U.S. fortress. Reagan got the troops home from Grenada for Christmas, and Trump manages the same here. Venezuela is, of course, a far bigger prize. But the same script holds. Lightning op. Instant handoff. America is back, baby. The Great Pitfall.

9:19

This is a unicorn outcome. Always dreamt of but rarely spotted because it requires perfect timing. Quadrant 3. Lower left corner of the XY. high resilience by the regime, coupled with strong external leverage. So the worst case. We'll call this one prolonged coercion grind. The historical analogy, Iraq, 2010 to 2011, Operation New Dawn.

9:58

Maduro's Praetorian Guard, colectivos, patrolling slums, Loyalist generals cashing payoff checks, Cuban advisors pulling intel strings. His Praetorian Guard stays locked in tight, fueled by raw regime survival instinct and thick external lifelines. Russian Spetsnaz trainers drilling kill squads. Chinese credit lines propping up the still warm corpse of the national oil company, PDVSA. Iranian shadow tankers slipping sanctions.

10:43

Cuban ops keeps dissent crushed. The U.S. response escalates beyond pure remote theater, initial offshore coercion, sanctions, cyber, naval, eventually superseded by limited ground entry, 5,000 to 10,000 Marines, Army, stabilization enablers, they are called, seizing key oil terminals and border posts, advise Iraqi-style proxies, opposition militias, Gonzalez allies, run special ops raids from forward bases,

11:26

and overwatch with drones and artillery to interdict backer supply lines. No full invasion flood, just enough boots to choke the disorder pipeline. Migrants drop 70%, drug seizures explode, grinding insurgents and militias into diminished irrelevance over what ends up being an intervention stretching into 2027. Maduro bunkers down as cartel state zombie.

12:02

External sugar daddies supply cash and arms just enough to prolong the low-boil hell. Quadrant 4, lower right corner. That one has high resilience by the Maduro regime, but weak external leverage from backers. We'll call that one controlled topple. The historical analogy, Panama, 1989, Operation Just Cause. Regime internals initially hold, generals paid off, colectivos terrorizing streets,

12:48

but backers eventually bail. As Putin eyes Ukraine meat grinder, Xi pivots to Taiwan opportunity, Cuba starves, sans Venezuelan oil, and Iran flees U.S. carriers. leverage evaporates. Trump's play. Hybrid blitz. Seal raids on Maduro bunkers. Drone decapitations of key lieutenants. Cyber fuel defections via hacked regime payrolls. Gonzalez's opposition surges with U.S. backing and funding.

13:34

Military splinters just enough for palace coup optics. We install, stabilize with private contractors. Think Academy, nay, Blackwater. We ink oil deals and exit in months, just in time for a massive military parade in D.C. to celebrate our 250th. Meanwhile, migration reverses. Chevron rigs hum. The hidden risk? Initial internal resilience masks deeper rot,

14:12

with post-topple militias sparking urban guerrilla redux. The hoped-for follow-on scenario from any of these four? That would be the U.S. moves quickly after the government's collapse to stabilize the region, reopening economic corridors, oil flowing north, goods moving south, backing security agreements that disarm militias, and coordinating debt restructuring with the IMF and Brazil. The goal?

14:46

Prevent a power vacuum and block any slide back into chaos. Trump's Don Roe doctrine seeds the hemisphere with Malay-style economic liberators in South America and Bukele model security strongmen across Central America, effectively firewalling America off from future migration flows, or so it hopes. As for the odds, I give you the following likelihood ranking.

15:24

The Grenada scenario is more likely than the Panama scenario, which is more likely than the Haiti scenario, which is more likely than the Iraq scenario. The odds favor the cleaner winds, Grenada, Panama, because sustained coercion tends to crack internals first. Defections snowball, protests surge again. The grinds, Haiti, Iraq scenarios linger only if backers flood in endless lifelines,

16:00

which strains their bandwidth. Russia remains too busy with Ukraine, Iran too fearful of Israel. And as for China, if I were Xi... I'd be very tempted to hammer Taiwan while America's iron was plunged into this fire. Deep down, when I consider this whole scenario package, I see a lot of potential downside for Trump and not much upside,

16:35

meaning the taco Trump always chickens out scenario outranks all four of my quadrants. Still, I will evince no surprise when the first bombs hit. Trump is a lame duck POTUS with an impulse disorder. So, anything's possible. See you next time.
