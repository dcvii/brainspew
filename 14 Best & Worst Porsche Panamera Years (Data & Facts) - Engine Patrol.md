2021 Porsche Panamera, Edmunds Review:

*“I love this car. Previously I had a 2019 Macan 4S (which is an awesome little car) but needed something bigger for all my highway travel.  Before that a 2007 MB 550 SL (loved it). Bought this one as a lease turn-in with 6400 miles on it. No issues ever…”*

### **2019 and 2018 Porsche Panamera**

**For a perfect balance between value in the used car market and the latest in performance and technology, we recommend opting for either the 2019 or 2018 Panamera this year.**

They offer exceptional handling, a sleek and sophisticated design, and a spacious interior with room for adults in either row.

New for these model years are equipment shuffling and more trim levels (GTS and Sport Turismo GTS).

Notable safety features include the following:

- Lane Departure Warning and Intervention
- Forward Collision Warning

Based on the EPA’s testing, owners could expect as much as 21 to 22 MPG for combined city and highway driving, which is quite a good figure for a large luxury car.

- **JD Power: 79 / 100**

2019 Porsche Panamera, Edmunds Review:

*“While I have only had the car a few weeks, it is everything I expected.  Luxurious and refined when desired or a “beast” when you want performance. (Just choose regular, sport, sport plus or custom driving mode.) The car grips the road, including corners, like no sedan I have ever driven. The seats are ultra-comfortable, front and rear. My ratings on reliability and value are only four stars because it is too early to know.”*

### **2017 Porsche Panamera**

**The 2017 model represents a total overhaul of the original first-generation design, moving away from its previously more rounded exterior.**

The 2017 model introduced a more streamlined and striking four-door Porsche sedan, delivering performance that surpassed its predecessors.

There are a variety of trim levels available (other than the hybrid options): Base, 4, 4S, Turbo, 4 Executive, 4S Executive, and Turbo Executive.

Aside from the base model, all variants are equipped with all-wheel drive.

In terms of engines, the base, 4, and 4 Executive models are driven by a turbocharged 3-liter V6 engine, delivering 330 horsepower and 331 pound-feet of torque. 

The midrange 4S and 4S Executive come with a turbocharged 2.9-liter V6 engine (440 horsepower, 404 pound-feet of torque).

The top-spec Turbo and Turbo Executive make use of a large 4-liter V8 engine (550 horsepower, 567 pound-feet of torque).

- **Edmunds: 4.6 / 5.0**
- **Kelley Blue Book: 4.7 / 5.0**
- **JD Power: NA**

2017 Porsche Panamera, Edmunds Review:

*“Starting off, the looks on this car are gorgeous. It stands out from the crowd of ‘boring’ looking cars and can give you some unwarranted attention on the road or driving in town. Most people won’t know that the car is a Porsche, however they’ll know when they hear it…”*

### **2016 Porsche Panamera**

**The 2016 Panamera is the final first-gen model year ever produced.**

It features the traditional exterior design and interior styling, earning accolades as one of the more fuel-efficient choices in the fiercely competitive luxury sedan market.

The model provides athletic handling, refined driver assistance tech, and a multitude of variations and options.

Based on reviews by owners online, these are the noteworthy aspects of the model:

- Handling
- Steering
- Appearance
- Engine
- Interior
- Value for money
- Spaciousness

Depending on the trim level you select, the EPA claims that owners can expect anywhere between 18 MPG to 22 MPG under combined city and highway driving conditions. 

- **Edmunds: 4.7 / 5.0**
- **Kelley Blue Book: 4.8 / 5.0**
- **JD Power: NA**

2016 Porsche Panamera, Edmunds Review:

*“This car is very sexy. The lines are gorgeous and I feel like a million bucks when I drive it. The handling is wonderful, sport mode makes it even more aggressive and more of a racing feel. I love this car and could not be happier with my choice. I was looking for a high end luxury sports car that could still handle 4 passengers. There is no other car quite like this…”*
