Later today, on the eve of the U.S. Army’s [250th birthday](https://www.army.mil/1775/), I will raise my right hand, take an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve’s newly formed Detachment 201: Executive Innovation Corps.

Receiving their commissions at my side will be some of the most impressive minds from the world of technology: Kevin Weil, the chief product officer of OpenAI; Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, the chief technology officer of Meta; and Bob McGrew, formerly the chief research officer of OpenAI and engineering director of Palantir Technologies, where I work as chief technology officer.

None of these men need to pad their résumé. None have free time between fatherhood, demanding day jobs, and a dozen other demands. But all feel called to serve.

A decade ago, it would’ve been unthinkable for so many tech heavyweights to openly align with the U.S. military. Equally, it would’ve been out of character for the military to enlist the support of the nation’s business elite—much less to create a special corps so they could deploy their technical talents in service of the government.

But a sea change has taken place in both places because of the urgency and seriousness of the moment.

Wars in Europe and the Middle East and, above all, the threat of a war in the Pacific have focused the national mind and initiated a scramble for mobilization. [Exploding pagers](https://www.thefp.com/p/hezbollahs-pagers-and-walkie-talkies) and long-distance [drone strikes from shipping containers](https://www.thefp.com/p/future-of-war-is-now) prove that technology has once again changed the battlefield. Our military has to change with it.

The U.S. Isn’t Ready for a Modern War

The Army’s Executive Innovation Corps, under the direction of the Army’s chief of staff, [General Randy George](https://www.army.mil/leaders/csa/), is part of a larger effort by our military to transform the way it prepares for and fights wars in the 21st century. Marrying the nation’s most innovative private companies with our most important military missions is fundamental to that effort. That cooperation relies on reviving a sense of duty in an American elite that has become disconnected from our nation and its tradition of service.

I decided to join the military for reasons both patriotic but also intensely personal.

My father grew up in a mud hut in Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state in India. He was the youngest of nine children and the first in his family to attend college—an education made possible only by his eight siblings pooling their wages. After graduation, he moved to Lagos, Nigeria, to build and run a pharmaceutical plant. Through ingenuity and an enterprising spirit, he became successful at a remarkably young age.

When I was 2, our life in Lagos ended violently. Five armed men broke into our home, killed our dog, pistol-whipped my father, and threatened my mother as they demanded money from the company safe. We fled Lagos with nothing, and started over in America.

My father took a job at a company that supplied souvenirs to theme parks in Orlando, Florida. My childhood memories are punctuated by Space Shuttle launches seen from my school courtyard, and by the bone-rattling double sonic booms of the Shuttles’ reentry. Lessons about the power of American technology were literally falling from the sky around me.

Alex Karp: We Need a New Manhattan Project

My father never again saw the material success of his youth, and he faced setback after setback in America. But he always reminded me of the counterfactual: “But for the grace of this nation, you would be dead in a ditch in Lagos.” America gave him life, liberty, and possibility.

In return, he went out of his way to help every person he possibly could achieve the American dream. He devoted his Sundays to running a free education class to help local kids get into college, and spent car rides on the phone helping people he hardly knew navigate life’s difficulties. As a teenager, I found his earnest efforts inscrutable and vaguely embarrassing. As with so many life lessons, it was only with age that I appreciated the extent of his sacrifice and his love of country.

“After 20 years working alongside our men and women in uniform, I realized I needed to do much more,” writes Shyam Sankar. (Brandon Bell via Getty Images)

Twenty years ago, that calling brought me to Palantir, a company founded in the aftermath of 9/11 to answer the challenges of our generation. From our earliest days, we’ve provided world-class software to help our military predict where ambushes are likely to occur, hunt down terrorists, make better-informed decisions even when far from the front lines—and much more.

After 20 years working alongside our men and women in uniform, I saw firsthand how much they sacrifice for our country—and I realized I needed to do much more. The Army will be putting me and my fellow technologists to work on its most ambitious transformation efforts, including accelerating outcomes in [human-machine integrated formations](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2024/10/14/army-gaining-ground-on-human-machine-integrated-formations#:~:text=Initiated%20in%202023%2C%20the%20Army%27s,first%20contact%20with%20an%20adversary.), hypersonics, and recruiting and mentoring world-class talent. The only requirement is winning.

Throughout most of the 20th century, American defense and commercial innovation were inseparable. General Mills made both Cheerios and torpedoes.

There is a precedent for this.

In May 1940, as Nazi Germany’s war machine consumed Europe, President [Franklin Roosevelt summoned](https://www.historynet.com/the-speed-up-king/) William Knudsen to Washington from the factory floor of General Motors. Knudsen was a Danish immigrant who had scaled the Fordist model of mass production and rose to run GM, America’s largest corporation at the time. He was commissioned as a three-star general with a monumental mission: Transform America's industrial might into what FDR [came to call](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-9) the “arsenal of democracy.”

Knudsen was not alone. Ultimately, [hundreds of business leaders](https://manufacturing-victory.org/history/leaders.php) flocked to lend their expertise to the government, in exchange for nominal salaries and punishing work schedules. These patriots were known as “dollar-a-year men.”

That tradition continued throughout much of the 20th century. American defense and commercial innovation were inseparable. General Mills made both Cheerios [and torpedoes](https://tcbmag.com/150-years-of-general-mills-a-look-back/#:~:text=Even%20during%20World%20War%20II%2C%20General%20Mills,a%20full%20U%2Dturn\)%20back%20to%20the%20target.). Ford Motor Company [built satellites](https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/471829#slide=gs-452945). Chrysler Corporation [manufactured missiles](https://history.redstone.army.mil/miss-redstone.html) and minivans. This wasn’t corporate diversification—it was national integration. The same minds that revolutionized consumer products applied their genius to defending the free world. They believed it was their duty to do so.

That partnership started to unravel in the 1960s and ’70s, when America’s elites became radicalized, against the Vietnam War, capitalism, and the American cause. It fell apart completely following the Cold War, thanks to funding cuts, arcane regulations, and the lack of an existential enemy.

That was the case until quite recently, when efforts began to reunite commercial innovation with the military’s mission. Palantir was the forerunner in this effort, followed by other industry-changing companies such as [Anduril Industries](https://research.contrary.com/company/anduril) and [Saronic Technologies](https://www.ensemble.vc/research/why-were-backing-saronic-technologies-and-their-mission-to-redefine-us-maritime-superiority). For many years we were distrusted—even despised—in the Valley precisely because we worked for the military.

No longer.

More and more, the nation’s technologists are realizing we face threats to our freedom as serious as any we faced in the 20th century. And they’re rediscovering Silicon Valley’s [roots in national defense](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/01/the-silicon-valley-model-and-technological-trajectories-in-context?lang=en) during the Second World War and Cold War. But unlike in 1940 or 1960, the architects of American technical dominance today are too often absent from the rooms where national security decisions are made.

Our adversaries aren't waiting for our acquisition cycles or deferring to our budget processes. They're building, iterating, and preparing for war.

Over the course of World War II, GM’s Pontiac Motor Division [turned out](https://usautoindustryworldwartwo.com/General%20Motors/pontiac.htm#:~:text=Pontiac%20Motor%20Division%20of%20GM%20World%20War,M24%20Chaffee%20tanks%20built%20by%20Cadillac%2C%20parts) 47,026 anti-aircraft cannons. Today, Tesla factories [have been known](https://www.energytrend.com/news/20220113-25375.html) to produce new cars in less than a minute. Meanwhile, our defense industrial base measures progress in decades.

This isn’t just about efficiency—it’s about survival.

The drones are swarming today. Our adversaries aren’t waiting for our acquisition cycles or deferring to our budget processes. They’re building, iterating, and preparing for war.

Over the past few years there have been moves in the right direction. First, there was the explosion of interest and funding for defense and hard tech start-ups, which has produced companies that are marrying cutting-edge software with mass-produced metal. Second, there has been a wave of reforms inside government; the Army’s new Executive Innovation Corps is only one part of this story. President Trump [has ordered](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/modernizing-defense-acquisitions-and-spurring-innovation-in-the-defense-industrial-base/) the Pentagon to cancel over-budget or behind-schedule weapon development programs, accelerate the terminally slow [acquisition process](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/modernizing-defense-acquisitions-and-spurring-innovation-in-the-defense-industrial-base/), and deliver the best commercial technology available to our warfighters. Leaders [in Congress](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/06/09/bipartisan-house-proposal-aims-to-speed-up-defense-acquisition-work/) and [the services](https://api.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/2025/05/01/c4c9539c/letter-to-the-force-army-transformation-initiative.pdf) are pushing similar reforms. For the first time in a generation, wildly different groups are united in service of the national interest. The gap between Silicon Valley and Washington is—finally—beginning to be bridged.

My children are still too young to fully understand what it means to serve, just as I was too young to understand how much my father sacrificed for my family and me. In time, I hope my children come to understand that privilege is just another word for responsibility.

The uniform I’m putting on today is a symbol of gratitude transformed into action; of success converted into service; of understanding that in America's moment of need, those who can serve, must.

The arsenal of democracy needs its architects back. Who else will answer the call?
