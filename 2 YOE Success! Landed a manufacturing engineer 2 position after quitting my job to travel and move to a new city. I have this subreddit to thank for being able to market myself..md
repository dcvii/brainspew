Finally signed a job offer today after a 6 month search! I had a bit of a unique situation in the job hunt because I resigned from my last position to relocate to a big metro that would allow me better career options. I didn't line anything up because I wanted to travel in Europe for 3 months, which I did (it was awesome). I'm very thankful to see my leap of faith pay off.

Big 3 pieces of resume advice that I found helpful: This subreddit's wiki, a tip from a recruiter to only put years instead of months to obscure the fact I resigned middle of last year and had been out of work for a while, and this post: [https://old.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1k5w9v3/12\_yoe\_resume\_tips\_how\_recruiters\_actually\_screen/](https://old.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1k5w9v3/12_yoe_resume_tips_how_recruiters_actually_screen/)

Biggest 2 pieces of advice I would give myself: Only apply to jobs that are less than 3 days old. If you can, apply on the same day. It's not scientific, but I would say the vast majority of my callbacks were from applications I submitted the day of or the next day after the posting. Most of my applications that I submitted a week or two after the posting were ignored. Also, in my opinion Indeed is better than linkedin. A lot of postings appeared to be not real. With indeed, it felt like every job was posted on there with the intention of being filled. However, the important caveat is that smaller companies will sometimes post on linkedin and not indeed. Perhaps because it costs less. Again this isn't scientific, it's just what I observed.

My stats: 61 applications, 11 call backs, 7 first interviews, 2 second interviews, 1 offer. I was in the first interview stage with 2 companies when I accepted my offer.

I focused on quality over quantity which I think helped me since I was limiting myself to a geographic area which only produced 2-5 'good fits' a week. I spent on average 30 minutes tailoring my resume to each application, which included writing new bullet points targeting the job requirements.

The job offer came to me 3 weeks after my last interview with the company, after I'd already written it off. So sometimes it just takes a while. I've also noticed in the last couple months the economic situation has thrown hiring into confusion, with one company pulling out in the middle of interviews because they weren't sure how they were going to weather it. I believe this happened with a few other applications made around the same time as well, they just didn't tell me.

With regards to my large gap (10 months as of now), it did come up every time during interviews. When asked, it was easy to tell that they were really asking if I had left my last employer on bad terms. I didn't sense the gap was an issue for 80% of the interviewers I talked to. I always told them that I resigned to relocate to the area and decided to travel for a few months, and I left my last employer on good terms. That seemed good enough for most people, and if they had done some travelling themselves it became something to chat about and connect with the interviewer.

I also switched industries from defence aerospace manufacturing to medical device manufacturing. Moving on from the defence industry was a goal and I think the similar level of regulatory requirements helped my case towards being effective in the medical device industry.

Here's the winning resume:

Thank you all!
