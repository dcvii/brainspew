## üòò Kiss bugs goodbye with fully automated end-to-end test coverage (Sponsored)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XqbG!)

Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there) is hard and pricey for any team.

[QA Wolf‚Äôs](https://bit.ly/QAWolf_070525QAWolf) AI-native service provides high-volume, high-speed test coverage for **web and mobile apps**, reducing your organizations QA cycle to less than 15 minutes.

They can get you:

- [80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks](https://bit.ly/QAWolf_070525E2E)
- [Unlimited parallel test runs](https://bit.ly/QAWolf_070525Parallel)
- 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
- Zero flakes, guaranteed

Engineering teams **move faster**, releases stay on track, and testing happens automatically‚Äîso developers can focus on building, not debugging.

[Drata‚Äôs team of 80+ engineers](https://bit.ly/QAWolf_070527Drata) achieved 4x more test cases and 86% faster QA cycles.

## Best ways to test system functionality

Testing system functionality is a crucial step in software development and engineering processes.

It ensures that a system or software application performs as expected, meets user requirements, and operates reliably.

![Image](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e0f17b6-cec8-4607-a058-eae3e446b6a6_3327x3946.jpeg%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:1727,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:null,%22alt%22:%22Image%22,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:null,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:null,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false%7D)

Here we delve into the best ways:

1. Unit Testing: Ensures individual code components work correctly in isolation.
2. Integration Testing: Verifies that different system parts function seamlessly together.
3. System Testing: Assesses the entire system's compliance with user requirements and performance.
4. Load Testing: Tests a system's ability to handle high workloads and identifies performance issues.
5. Error Testing: Evaluates how the software handles invalid inputs and error conditions.
6. Test Automation: Automates test case execution for efficiency, repeatability, and error reduction.

Over to you: How do you approach testing system functionality in your software development or engineering projects?

## How CQRS Works?

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates write (Command) and read (Query) operations for better scalability and maintainability.

![](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/df32b82e-fb8e-4d38-82b1-b018168fa88a_2360x2770.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:1709,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:293494,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/167542144?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf32b82e-fb8e-4d38-82b1-b018168fa88a_2360x2770.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1 - The client sends a command to update the system state. A Command Handler validates and executes logic using the Domain Model.

2 - Changes are saved in the Write Database and can also be saved to an Event Store. Events are emitted to update the Read Model asynchronously.

3 - The projections are stored in the Read Database. This database is eventually consistent with the Write Database.

4 - On the query side, the client sends a query to retrieve data.

5 - A Query Handler fetches data from the Read Database, which contains precomputed projections.

6 - Results are returned to the client without hitting the write model or the write database.

Over to you: What else will you add to understand CQRS?

## How MongoDB Works?

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database designed for flexibility, scalability, and high performance. It stores data in a JSON-like format (BSON) and supports horizontal scaling through sharding and replication.

![Image](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95a38be8-f32e-4539-8900-5e9d6f9d40bf_2360x2770.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:1709,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:null,%22alt%22:%22Image%22,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:null,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:null,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false%7D)

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Client application connects via a MongoDB Driver to perform read/write operations.
2. The Query Router (mongos) acts as a mediator, directing queries to the appropriate shard based on the data‚Äôs shard key.
3. Config servers store metadata and routing information. This helps query routers locate data across shards.
4. The data is distributed across multiple shards to support horizontal scaling.
5. Each shard is a replica set that consists of one primary node for handling writes and multiple secondary nodes for high availability and read scaling.
6. If a primary fails, a secondary is automatically elected to replace it and maintain availability.

Over to you: What else will you add to understand MongoDB‚Äôs working better?
