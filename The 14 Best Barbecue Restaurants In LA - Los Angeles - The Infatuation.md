Sometimes, all you want is to eat a half-pound of smoked meat off a sheet of butcher paper. When that urge hits, head to these places. Los Angeles might not be well known for barbecue, but our city's scene has grown by leaps and bounds over the past decade. We've compiled 14 of our favorite brick-and-mortar barbecue restaurants, plus six local pop-ups we're most excited about. From smoked coconut beef adobo to pork belly burnt ends to dino ribs the size of a boombox, here's where to find the best barbecue in LA.

No rating: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it’s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop. We only rate spots where you can eat a full meal.

## THE SPOTS

There still isn’t a more talked-about and sought-after barbecue spot in town than Moo’s. So what’s all the hype about? Texas-style 'cue that, depending on who you ask, rivals the best of the Lone Star State. That might be debatable, but we have no doubt theb pork ribs, smoked turkey, pulled pork, and signature brisket at this causal Lincoln Heights spot are the greatest we’ve eaten in LA. But Moo’s isn’t limited to just big slabs of meat (or a [great burger](https://www.theinfatuation.com/los-angeles/guides/best-burger-la)). Their mac and cheese is crusty on top and properly gooey inside, the dill-heavy potato salad is light and fragrant, and if you show up to your next friend picnic with their tres leche pudding bread pudding, you’ll be the star of the afternoon. Heads up: order takeout before 2pm and you can skip the (very long) lines.

It's impossible to mention Ray's in Huntington Park without highlighting the challenges of the family behind it. After founder Rene “Ray” Ramirez passed away unexpectedly in 2022, his wife and children took the lead and kept this strip mall spot's dedication to Texas barbecue alive. Our go-to here is the well-marbled brisket encrusted in pepper and cooked in an oak-powdered cabinet smoker in back—order it by the pound with a side of their sweet-spicy sauce, or get it in the Pitmaster's Sandwich with cheese, slaw, pickles, and a whole roasted jalapeño. The dining room is small, but expect to see utility workers on their lunch break and others subtly undoing a pants button after consuming one too many jalapeño-cheddar sausages.

As much as we secretly love the smell of gasoline, the scent at the Shell station at Vineland and Vanowen in North Hollywood is unrivaled. That’s because Swinging Door BBQ lives next door, a saloon-themed, Texas-style spot that runs a double-barreled smoker in their back alley and perfumes the whole block with oak and apple wood. Combo plates are the move here, and we suggest getting one with fatty brisket that falls apart with one chomp, crisp-skinned baby backs that slide off the bone, and burnt ends that should be renamed, “fatty beef bits with a nice char.” Add a side of brothy, onion-y collard greens plus mac and cheese and it’ll be the best money you’ll ever spend near a gas pump.

Serving American barbecue classics with a Filipino twist, The Park’s Finest in Echo Park sticks out not just on this list, but from anywhere else in the city. Smoked meats, like slow-roasted pulled pork, roasted chicken with a candy-like crust, and longanisa hot links sliced in a perfect row, are all fantastic. But nothing compares to their coconut beef adobo, made from 16-hour smoked chuck stewed in coconut cream and fish sauce until it falls apart. Park's offers all four of these excellent options, along with cornbread bibingka and white rice, on a $20 sampler plate every Wednesday.

Bludso’s sits firmly in our city’s pantheon of great barbecue. Originally started in Compton, this low-key smokehouse now resides in a spacious picnic-bench-filled space on La Brea in Hollywood ([with a second location in Santa Monica](https://www.theinfatuation.com/los-angeles/reviews/bludsos-santa-monica)). Aside from excellent smoked meats, it's become one of the neighborhood's most dependable group dinner spots and a fun place to watch a game. If you're with a lot of people (up to 15), their party trays come with prime brisket, pulled pork, ribs, chicken, hot links, and a heap of sides for a reasonable per-person price. There are no clear misses on the menu, so order what sounds best, grab a beer off their excellent tap list, and watch whatever sports team is imploding on the TV.

Phillips Bar-B-Que is all business. The sign out front of this LA institution reminds you that it’s takeout only (although if you're lucky, there will be an open table in the parking lot). Ordering and pick-up lines are separated, the former is organized by an efficient divider. That is to say, expect a crowd. On weekends, the entire Mid-City community pours in for their excellent smoked meat, like succulent pork ribs and rib tips smothered in a thick, glistening sauce. Everything can be served either a la carte, in a sandwich, or combined with a few sides, but the sleeper hit here is their chicken links. The spicy, snappy sausages are sliced into thick coins with sauce on the side. Order them by the pound.

*Note: Phillips Crenshaw location is closed through mid-July for renovations, but their second location at 1517 Centinela Ave. in Inglewood remains open.*

To put Ribtown’s size into perspective, its offset smoker is bigger than its entire trailer. Parked in a pawn shop’s parking lot in Jefferson Park, this weekend barbecue operation is known for its melty pork rib tips. Each one is the best parts of a spare rib compacted in two bites: fatty, cartilage-y bits smoked low-and-slow until they’re tender and squishy to the touch. They’re great for lapping up  Ribtown’s sweet-smoky barbecue sauce that gets all over your fingers (because you’re definitely eating these with your hands). Ribtown also makes great brisket and snappy hot links that burst with salty, fatty juice when you bite in.

For all the regional styles that can be found in LA, Memphis barbecue is still relatively underrepresented. Which is why The Memphis Grill in North Hollywood is worth seeking out. Every meal at this takeout-only operation needs to start with the pulled pork and baby back ribs, which are coated in a zesty reddish dry rub and served with tomato-based sauce on the side, which adds a nice tanginess that cuts through the rich, smoky meat. For pure value, we'd point you toward the combo plates with two meats and two sides (get the yams and collard greens). It's enough food for multiple meals.

Meteorite is a blink-and-you-miss-it barbecue trailer on the eastern edge of Westlake that’s run by a former Korean kickboxing champion. As fascinating as that story is, the Texas-style barbecue at Meteorite serves is even better. Their signature pepper-crusted brisket is neatly trimmed with just a thin edge of fat right along the edges, yet so tender it pulls apart with a soft tug. All meats are available by the half-pound, but if it’s your first time, go with the three-meat platter to sample the rich pulled pork and spare ribs in mustard-y sauce, too. Just be aware that Meteorite is only open on weekdays until 4pm—if you work Downtown, though, it’s the perfect takeout lunch.  

We’re not sure what we like better at JR’s: eating the Memphis-style barbecue or listening to Robert, the owner, lovingly razz everyone in line. We’ll call it a draw—they’re both great. This order-at-the-window spot in Culver City has been around since 1998 and draws weekend lines that snake around their gravel parking lot. This is Memphis-style ‘cue, so pork is king, but our go-to order is the large beef ribs dinner. For $26, you get two sides (go with baked beans and creamy potato salad) and a half-rack of massive, smoky, slightly sweet ribs. You’ll have to wait a bit at the picnic tables for your food, but don’t stray far. If you aren’t ready when your name is called, you’re going to hear about it from Robert.

Located on a quiet block on the southern edge of DTLA, Bo Baddy BBQ is a straightforward walk-up window serving glorious rib tips. These three-inch nubs of pork are meltingly tender with a firm, vinegary bark—the kind of wood-smoked barbecue that requires a moment of silent contemplation with each bite. We also love their tender baby back ribs slathered in sweet-spicy housemade sauce, and the fatty slabs of smoked brisket cooked until they jiggle. Although Bo Daddy's is open through dinner, we recommend arriving closer to noon, since they often sell out by sundown. And while there are no tables outside, posting up in the massive meat-scented parking lot next door is a fine tailgate option. 

Maple Block is an unpretentious barbecue joint in Culver City that will appeal to just about everyone. The brisket is the star of the show, but they also serve plump smoked wings that'll make you realize most versions barely have any meat on them at all. On weekends, they also make fantastic brunch-ified barbecue dishes, like a brisket breakfast burrito and a smoked pork belly eggs benedict. Come here for an after-work drink and loaded fries at the bar, throw a big group dinner on the patio, or plan a date night where getting sauce on your face is a deal-maker, not a breaker.

Handy Market is an unassuming corner store in Burbank where you might stop during the week for craft beer, wine, and various sundries. Come on a Saturday though, and you’ll be treated to an all-out barbecue wonderland in their adjacent parking lot. Rows of tri-tip, ribs, turkey legs, corn on the cob, and sausages all wafting their smokiness through the neighborhood. It’s a sight to behold and a great place to take people who can’t fathom something like this happening in the Valley. This is a pick-up-and-go situation, so order what you want in the adjacent building, and then eat your haul in the car like the rest of us.

This 50-year-old Van Nuys institution serves Texas-style barbecue that won't win any awards, but still holds a place in our nostalgic, kitsch-loving hearts. The wood-paneled dining room and waitresses who call you "hon" while slicing pecan pie will make you feel like you've fallen into a 1970s time warp. The food isn't flashy, but that's not why you're here. You’re at Dr. Hogly Wogly’s because of the famous sweet and smoky sauce, gigantic spare ribs that might’ve come from a T-Rex, and the kitschy, downhome vibe that you can only find at an old-school relic deep in the Valley.

## THE POP-UPS

[Adam Perry Lang](https://www.instagram.com/adamperrylang/tagged/?hl=en)’s roving barbecue operation has a passionate following on par with The Grateful Dead, with lines to match. Lang previously cooked at Jimmy Kimmel’s backlot and ran a now-closed Hollywood steakhouse, but these days can be found serving theatrically prepared $250 wagyu tomahawks and $75 pecan-smoked beef short ribs, most recently at [Gin Rummy](https://www.theinfatuation.com/los-angeles/reviews/gin-rummy). Yes, APL’s barbecue is some of the most expensive in LA (and generally lighter on smoke flavor), but meat quality is top-notch and most orders include sides.

This East LA-based pop-up melds Texas and Chicano barbecue culture, with some creative twists thrown in, to create food that’s distinctly LA. You’ll often find them at the weekly El Sereno Night Market, or popping up at various breweries and bars around town, serving smoked meats like al pastor pork belly and smoked cochinita pibil, plus “animal-style” smashburgers and roasted chile mac and cheese. Follow their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/as_bbq/) for preorder info.

Run by a former restaurant chef, [Zef BBQ](https://www.instagram.com/zef.bbq/?hl=en) is best known for hulking beef “dino ribs,” prime brisket, and Santa Maria-style tri-tip. But don’t overlook the creative side dishes, which flip from things like loaded mole fries to smoked curry cauliflower weekly. The only catch is the fairly complex ordering process: preorders are [placed online](https://www.exploretock.com/zefbbq) on Wednesday mornings (before they sell out) and picked up on the weekend at a to-be-named location in Simi Valley.

AGL’s is a pop-up fixture at different breweries around LA (usually in Northeast LA and the South Bay) which is convenient because we doubt there’s a more perfect food to pair with fresh beer than their loosely Texas-style ‘cue. Classic brisket, jalapeño-cheddar sausages, and pork ribs are all done well, but it’s specials like smoked beef cheeks, pork belly burnt ends, brisket tacos, and pastrami-style beef ribs that have us tracking their movement like NORAD. Follow them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aglscraftmeats/?hl=en).

River Street is a Texas-inspired barbecue outlet that pops up regularly in Northeast LA, most often at [Benny Boy Brewing](https://www.theinfatuation.com/los-angeles/reviews/benny-boy-brewing). Expect pepper-crusted brisket cooked with oak, and smoky pulled pork seasoned with salt and pepper and finished in an apple juice braise. Keep a lookout on their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/riverstreetbbq/) for their daily specials too, which can range from Tex-Mex tacos to smoked burgers.

Straight out of Long Beach, [Battambong BBQ](https://www.instagram.com/battambongbbq/?hl=en) serves a unique fusion of Texas-Cambodian barbecue that makes perfect sense once you take a bite. Smoked tri-tip and brisket, baby back ribs, chicken, pulled pork, pork belly, and spiced Cambodian sausages (our favorite) make up the selection here, and can be ordered as a combo plate with coconut corn and garlic noodles, or turned into tacos, nachos, or a banh mi-style sandwich. Find Battambong at various LBC breweries, the Bixby Knolls Farmers Market, or at Smorgasburg LA.
