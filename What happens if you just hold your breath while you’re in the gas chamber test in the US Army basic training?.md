What happens if you just hold your breath while you’re in the gas chamber test in the US Army basic training?

You couldn’t hold it that long. In the chamber, you have your gas mask on so that’s okay, but just before you walk out, you are told to remove the gas mask and state your name, rank and service number. And they make sure you get a good whiff of that gas. You can’t fool those guys.

Yes, believe me, it’s not pleasant. Look at their faces as they leave. One never forgets the gas chamber test.

Hold your breath? Yeah… Ok…

So here's what's going to happen. You go into the chamber, it fills with CS gas…

Then the DS is going to talk about the procedure. Then they're going to go around the room and ask you for your NAME, RANK, and SSN… They arrive to you finally…

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4782a41afe12ddfc35c5b75578da5e0d-lq)

You take a deep breath, take your mask off, and then give the info they require… Your eyes and nostrils immediately catch a hit of the gas and begin to burn and itch relentlessly. You start screaming your information to the DS. Just pray you're not the one they tell ‘I CAN'T F\*CKING HEEEAAAR YOUUU! ‘ NOW your throat, lungs and ever

It's a baaaaddd idea.

What is going to happen is you're going to take a breath before you leave the chamber.

Right now, you're just thinking about time. You're thinking you used to swim, you can hold your breath underwater for a long time, you should be able to hold your breath the amount of time it takes to walk around the room once and out, right?

You're not thinking of everything.

What did you do before you went underwater? You took a couple big breaths then one big gulp, right? Lmao were you wearing a gas mask? I'm thinking no.

So the breathing you've been doing for the last 5 minutes is gettin

Not US Army, but we did the same thing in training. I think most folk who’ve been in uniform have been through the gas chamber.

People tried to game the system, and it didn’t work\*. Part of the drill for us was that you had to take off your mask and recite your whole service description (rank, name, service number, trade). People had heard about this and practiced getting the whole thing out in one go without taking a breath.

On the day, they blurted out the whole thing in one go without taking a breath, very successfully.

The instructor, who was of course still wearing their respirator just smug

In the gas chamber test during U.S. Army basic training, soldiers are exposed to a small amount of tear gas (CS gas) to familiarize them with the effects and to ensure they know how to properly use their protective masks. Holding your breath in the gas chamber is not a recommended or effective strategy. Here’s what typically happens:

1. Inhalation Risk: While you may be able to hold your breath for a short time, the gas can still enter your system through other means, such as through your eyes or skin. The gas is designed to irritate mucous membranes, and even brief exposure can cause discomfort.
2. D

You could try. But, ulitmately, drill sergeants look for that.

There is a whole process involved to the gas chamber, there is a method to a rabid drill sergeant’s madness.

Make sure you enjoy breakfast because you might be having a second helping later (for a very few). Shave, oh boy, drill sergeants are extra vigilant on gas chamber day.

First, you line up in a row, waiting, nervous, because you just saw the previous squad run out like a horde of rabid bats. You enter the concrete block with your squad. You are told to close your eyes, hold your breath, and break the seal of your mask. The gas p

I think everyone’s made it clear that you can’t hold your breath.

They lined us up in four or five rows, demonstrated how to put on our gas masks, reinforced the notion that creating a good seal between mask and skin was vital and then dropped a CS pellet onto a metal plate above a Bunsen burner. The little pellet sputtered, dissolved a few wisps of smoke traveled up into the air. You couldn’t see it, but the room was quickly filled with CS gas.

The company commander reminded us that the only reason why we were comfortable at that time was because we had made a good seal between the mask and our

I /we our platoon volunteered to go first to get it behind us. Two notable things happened (maybe three depending how you see it) I was thinking scores of Joe's did this so it can't be that bad(wrong) . So they start down the line, you remove your mask on the front give your name rank and breathe…if you don't breathe they will ask you where your from, questions about your family…point is, your going to breath. So they get to the guy in front of me and as soon as his mask comes off it looks like an octopus is trying to screw a pissed off tiger, arms legs head flailing everywhere, I was thinking

2/22/96 — Gas!

After a 0430 first call, PT, and breakfast, we loaded into “cattle cars” — the same or similar ones we had arrived in the previous week — and headed over to the NBC range. This was the first of many field classrooms we would visit during our training. Instruction was held outdoors by chemical warfare experts, and we learnt all about chemical warfare, the different types of chemicals used, delivery systems, detection, treatment, etc.

And we were prepped for our turn through the gas chamber. This is one of the most memorable experiences of a soldier’s

What happens if you just hold your breath while you’re in the gas chamber test in the US Army basic training?

Well, the Drill Sergeants don’t allow that to happen :-) You go in, follow the directions about checking the seal of your mask, popping it open and then sealing it again and blowing the contaminated air out, and then you take the mask off all together.

This, I’m sure, is the part where you’re thinking “I’ll just hold my breath and fool them!”

Nope. Nada. Not happening. Depending on your DS, you’ll do PT in there (jumping jacks, push ups, etc) or shout of the Soldier's Creed or sing a cade

With our protective masks on we entered the gas chamber and sat on the floor. We then held our breath, lifted an edge of our masks breaking the seal, and after exposing our eyes and face to the CS gas resealed our masks.

We then stood up forming a line of ten to twelve of us. We took off our masks and placed our left arms through the straps so that the masks were hanging from our left arms. We then placed our right hand on the right shoulder of the soldier we were standing behind. With that the DS had us start walking around the room in a circle. Then the good part started: we started singing “

I did that.

The second time through anyway, not the first.

The first time through I did what I was supposed to, breathed it in, coughed, hacked, tears pouring down face, nose like a waterfall. After a minute or so of this they opened the door and let us out. It sucked, but it was over.

But it wasn’t.

As I was getting my gear back on some guys waiting to go in asked how bad it was, and I said “It sucks but it’s over quick, don’t sweat it”  
A Drill Sgt heard me and didn’t like it. I was ordered to go back through. When I tried to interject (hey, I was in a panic) he told me to STFU and get in line or

I'm a drill sergeant and a CBRN soldier. I've run every CS chamber my unit has done for the last 3 years.

Basic training is the only time a soldier can be made to remove their mask in the chamber. According to POI you can only be in the chamber without mask for 15 seconds before we have to give you the opportunity to leave.

That being said there are work arounds. In practice, the 15 seconds starts when the last person removes their mask. So take your time. Also the opportunity to leave means the door is open. It doesn't mean you are walking through it.

We also make you say something like the Sold

Not sure about US, but I would imagine that it is the same as the UK.

I was an NBC (Nuclear, Biological & Chemical, now called CBRN) instructor and used to see people try this all of the time.

I bet you that the filter in my respirator, which I would always be wearing whilst watching you holding your breath, can last longer than you can hold your breath. When you do breath (because you have been holding your breath) it is going to get you a lot better than if you just gave in and complied in the first place. Keeping your eyes screwed tightly shut won’t work either as I will just stand there sile

lmao. Yeah when you take your mask off you’re gonna get asked your name, DOB, ID number, maybe some other questions. Just to catch out all the geniuses who think they can hold their breath.
