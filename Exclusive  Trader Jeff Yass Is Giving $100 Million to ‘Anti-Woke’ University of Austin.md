The billionaire trader Jeff Yass is donating $100 million to the University of Austin, the fledgling program whose founders include venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale and journalist Bari Weiss, who [recently became editor in chief](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press-cbs-news-7e18f95e?mod=article_inline) of CBS News.

The university, which was formed in 2021, has about 150 students across its inaugural freshman and sophomore classes. It doesn’t charge tuition, though students cover costs for housing, meals and books.

The school, known as UATX, [has financial backing from](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/billionaires-back-a-new-anti-woke-university-fefd0c40?mod=article_inline) wealthy individuals frustrated by the political polarization and [silencing of unpopular ideas](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/a-free-speech-advocate-says-that-colleges-are-doing-it-wrong-c3685f9e?mod=article_inline) they were seeing at elite universities. The Wall Street Journal reported last fall that it had raised $200 million, including $35 million from Yass. Real-estate developer Harlan Crow and investor Len Blavatnik are also among the school’s early supporters.

UATX has a physical space in downtown Austin, Texas, and dedicated student housing. It says it is nonpartisan and describes its mission as “the fearless pursuit of truth.” Its curriculum prioritizes classical texts, such as Homer’s “The Odyssey,” and entrepreneurship.

“I was really impressed by what they have done,” said Yass.

He said he supports a separation between education and government, and wants to eliminate stress for parents who spend years saving up for their children’s college.

Yass, a major donor to Republican causes and co-founder of trading giant Susquehanna International Group, which has a [big stake in TikTok’s parent company](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/secretive-high-speed-trading-firm-hits-jackpot-with-tiktok-11601544610?mod=article_inline), has been the school’s largest benefactor to date. This $100 million gift will jump-start a new fund with the goal of raising a total of $300 million, said Carlos Carvalho, a former University of Texas at Austin business-school professor who became UATX’s president in June. He expects to be able to increase the student body to between 400 and 500 people.

Weiss, who has described [her news startup, the Free Press](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/bari-weisss-surging-news-startup-lures-readers-miffed-at-media-coverage-of-israel-07861ea4?mod=article_inline), as a check on mainstream media’s liberal orthodoxy, is a trustee at the school. She recently [sold the Free Press](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-buys-bari-weisss-the-free-press-for-150-million-737a94eb?mod=article_inline) to Paramount and assumed a top role at CBS News.

“A politics of censoriousness, forced conformity and ideological obedience has taken hold of our institutions,” Weiss said in a video for UATX in January.

Among other areas of possible growth, UATX hopes to create a journalism training program, Carvalho said. The school automatically accepts students with SAT scores of at least 1460 or ACT scores at or above 33.

Gifts are largely from donors associated with conservative causes, said Carvalho, who described established, elite universities as typically “left-dominated and controlled.”

Carvalho said he expects UATX to achieve accreditation by spring 2028—but it still won’t accept government funds. The school plans to rely entirely on donations.

UATX is betting in part on the success of future alumni and their desire to share their wealth, said Yass. “As you get older, pay it back,” he said of eventual graduates. “If the model doesn’t work, then the school should fail.”
