For the US Navy for Sturgeon, Trident and LA class ships this is approximately what happens. For newer ships the pilot instead of the DOOW received a lot of these command ( as I’ve been told by sailors of those ships). Rather than just give you a number I’d like to explain a bit what happens because as with most things related to going to sea it is far more complicated than civilians think it is.

The first step for submerging is to ‘rig the ship for Dive’ In every compartment there is a rig for dive bill in the compartment bill holder. The compartment bill holder is a metal binder mounted on the wall with laminated bills for every possible condition, such as:

rig for flooding, rig for visitors, rig for dive, rig for surface, rig for ventilation, rig for snorkel, rig for fire, etc, etc…

SIDEBAR - Everything on a submarine is done with the procedure in hand. Even the immediate actions which every watch stander memorizes for a casualty are done and then the manual is taken out and the steps are audited to ensure you didn't miss anything.

This engrained mindset and level of compliance is a hard earned understanding that without verification mistakes will occur and the ship may be damaged or sunk. Early in the US Navy’s submarine history sinking your ship by ‘doing it from memory’ occurred more than we’d like to admit and lives were lost. So, since early WWII the submarine force has embraced the idea of living and dying be a procedure. This was taken to an entirely new level when nuclear reactors were added and all officers were required to be nuclear trained… The entire ship became operated like the reactor…

Back to the question….

Each compartment is rigged for dive - first by a qualified enlisted man and then independently (so as to not, in error, get distracted) a qualified commissioned officer does the same checklist. My first ship used to use and “X” with a grease marker on the laminated bill. The enlisted did the left top to right bottom and the officer did the other way so when you saw the ‘X’ next to that line you knew it was second checked. My second ship didn't do it that way some things are based on the prerogative of the command.

Every required, valve, damper, switch, tank level , etc… is verified and any exceptions are reported to the ship’s duty officer. This all occurs sometimes in port and sometime as you transit to the dive point. There is a master log where every compartment is signed for by both checkers which is retained as a legal document.

While this is happening the Ship’s diving officer ( not the watch stander but the officer responsible for diving calculation and maintaining those various bills in every compartment) will do a calculation based on the last time the ship was submerged… He/ She accounts for all the weight changes - torpedos, food, personnel, fuel, water, lubricating oils, supplies and comes up with an initial dive tank level for every one of the variable ballast tanks. My first ship wrote a basic program to do it instead of relying on manual calculations ( although every officer to qualify had to do it manually once) In the end, the SDO ( ship’s diving officer) used to bet my first captain $20 bucks if he was within 5000 lbs of variable ballast.. That is very hard to do… Especially when you’ve been in a dry dock or in port for a long time.

Now the ship approaches water deep enough to dive in… which can be a mile off shore or hundreds of miles out depending on the bottom depth and tactical considerations.

The bridge watch standers prepare to submerge - the OOD transfer his watch below to another officer who now mans the scope. While the OOD and lookout do the first and second check on the bridge, the bridge access trunk, and then when they enter the control room. The officer closes the lower hatch and reports to the Chief of the Watch “ last man down, hatch secured” and they both sign what by then should be the only 2 exceptions for rig for dive in the log.

The OOD at the scope (reviews the dive log, get reports from the DOOW ( Diving officer of the watch) and then informs the captain of the ship’s condition.

My first Captain, in an attempt to create a sense of ownership preferred when his officers stated their intentions and he would acknowledge them as opposed to asking permission and him granting it.. So I usually always told him what I was doing and waiting for him to say ok, or “I concur.”

When The OOD is ready he looks forward, and orders the DOOW to submerge the ship… The OOD is looking for a plume of water from the forward vents and then turns aft to verify the aft vents are open, failure of a vent to open will force the OOD to order to secure from the dive until it can be fixed. Submerging with one tank not properly filled with water is dangerous and affects stability. When the deck goes underwater the OOD Reports “ deck awash.” and the COW closes the MBT vents. When the scope goes underwater, the OOD reports “Scopes awash, lowering number two scope.” The ship, by default, submerges to a pre-determined depth unless the OOD orders a “dive to Periscope depth” which is trickier because you’re trusting in that calculation done earlier to be accurate.

From when the MBT vents are opened until the ship is submerged usually takes a couple minutes… the ship proceeds to a specified depth, the COW cycles the MBT vents open and closed to let any remaining air trapped in them out and then they trim the ship to be neutral with a zero bubble. Those tanks levels are written down - to become the starting point for the next dive calculation and more importantly to determine if the Ship’s diving officer won or lost his $20 ….

Meanwhile all watch stations conduct an inspection to ensure there are no leaks or issues in their spaces. The compartments that always made me nervous were the torpedo room - very big holes for water to come in, the signal ejectors - smaller holes but still big, the Trash Disposal Unit, the the seawater piping related to the reactor - more big pipes… If all is good theDOOW reports to the OOD - “conditions normal on the dive.” and the ship is submerged and probably remains that way for 40 to 90 days…

Here’s a great video showing a trident submerging - you can clearly see the forward and after MBT vents opening so with all 6 tanks properly venting to sea the sub will submerge stably. As an extra bonus you can see a dolphin riding the bow wave of the sub at the 10 second timestamp…
