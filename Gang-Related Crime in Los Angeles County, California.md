Gang-related crime statistics for Los Angeles County has been spotty at best and almost nothing is current. The most recent complete statistics for any jurisdiction in Los Angeles County were for 2012, and that was for only one year. As of 2017, the Los Angeles Police Department hasn't released any complete numbers since 2009 (see below). Although Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck stated in 2016 that [gang-related crime had gone up 14.6 percent in 2015](http://www.dailynews.com/2016/01/13/gang-related-domestic-violence-crimes-spike-in-los-angeles/) and [nearly 60% of homicides were gang-related](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-crime-rises-in-los-angeles-20160112-story.html), we have seen few complete numbers for Los Angeles released to the public.

Gang-related crime data had not been released for all of Los Angeles County until 2012 (but only that year). That year, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department identified gang-related crimes within its jurisdiction in the department's annual crime data release.
