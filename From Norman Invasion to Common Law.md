Here is the list of significant events and documents in chronological order, culminating in the event that rendered the English monarchy largely symbolic:

1. **Assize of Clarendon (1166)**: Established procedures for criminal justice and the use of juries.
2. **Magna Carta (1215)**: Introduced the principle that the king was subject to the law.
3. **Provisions of Oxford (1258)**: Established a council to oversee the king's decisions, leading to parliamentary governance.
4. **Statute of Westminster (1275)**: Codified existing laws and introduced new legal principles.
5. **Model Parliament (1295)**: Included commoners for the first time, marking a step towards representative government.
6. **Petition of Right (1628)**: Outlined specific liberties that the king could not infringe upon.
7. **Habeas Corpus Act (1679)**: Established legal protections against arbitrary detention.
8. **Bill of Rights (1689)**: Set out the rights of Parliament and limits on the powers of the monarch, laying the foundation for a constitutional monarchy.
9. **Acts of Union (1707 and 1800)**: United England with Scotland and later Ireland, influencing the development of common law.

The **Bill of Rights (1689)** is the pivotal act that rendered the English monarchy largely symbolic, significantly limiting the powers of the monarch and establishing the supremacy of Parliament. This laid the groundwork for the modern constitutional monarchy in the United Kingdom.

The development of English Common Law was influenced by several key events and documents following the Magna Carta. Here are some of the most significant:

1. **Provisions of Oxford (1258)**: This set of reforms introduced by barons during the reign of King Henry III established a council to oversee the king's decisions, laying the groundwork for a parliamentary system.

2. **Statute of Westminster (1275)**: Issued during the reign of Edward I, this statute codified existing laws and introduced new legal principles, helping to formalize and unify English law.

3. **Model Parliament (1295)**: Also under Edward I, this parliament included commoners for the first time, marking a significant step towards representative government.

4. **Assize of Clarendon (1166) and Assize of Northampton (1176)**: Earlier than the Magna Carta but crucial in the development of common law, these reforms by Henry II established procedures for criminal justice and the use of juries.

5. **Petition of Right (1628)**: A constitutional document sent by the English Parliament to Charles I, which outlined specific liberties that the king could not infringe upon, reinforcing the principle that the monarch was subject to the law.

6. **Habeas Corpus Act (1679)**: This act established important legal protections against arbitrary detention, ensuring that no one could be imprisoned unlawfully.

7. **Bill of Rights (1689)**: Following the Glorious Revolution, this document set out the rights of Parliament and limits on the powers of the monarch, laying the foundation for a constitutional monarchy.

8. **Acts of Union (1707 and 1800)**: These acts united England with Scotland and later Ireland, respectively, bringing different legal traditions into the English system and influencing the development of common law.

Each of these milestones contributed to the shaping of English Common Law by establishing legal principles, reinforcing the rule of law, and expanding the rights of individuals and representative bodies.

The Roundheads were supporters of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War (1642–1651). They were opposed to the Royalists, who supported King Charles I. The name "Roundheads" referred to their practice of wearing their hair cut short, in contrast to the long, flowing locks favored by many of the Royalists.

Key points about the Roundheads and their rule:

1. **Origins and Beliefs**: The Roundheads were primarily composed of Puritans, merchants, and some members of the gentry. They supported parliamentary authority over the monarchy and were motivated by religious and political ideals, seeking to limit the powers of the king and promote Protestantism.

2. **English Civil War**: The conflict began in 1642 and lasted until 1651. The Roundheads, under the leadership of figures like Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Fairfax, eventually defeated the Royalists. Key battles included the Battle of Marston Moor (1644) and the Battle of Naseby (1645).

3. **Execution of Charles I**: After their victory in the civil war, the Roundheads, now in control of the Parliamentarian forces, put King Charles I on trial for treason. He was found guilty and executed on January 30, 1649.

4. **The Commonwealth and Protectorate**: Following the execution of Charles I, England became a republic known as the Commonwealth of England (1649–1660). Oliver Cromwell emerged as the dominant leader and was named Lord Protector in 1653, ruling until his death in 1658. His son, Richard Cromwell, succeeded him but lacked support and was forced to resign in 1659.

5. **End of Roundhead Rule**: The period of Roundhead rule effectively ended with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Charles II, the son of Charles I, was invited to return to England and was restored to the throne.

Thus, the Roundheads ruled England for approximately 11 years, from the execution of Charles I in 1649 until the Restoration in 1660.

Charles I was tried under a specially created law by the Parliamentarians, which was not based on established English legal precedents. The trial was conducted under the authority of the "Act of the House of Commons for the Trying of Charles Stuart, King of England," passed by the Rump Parliament in January 1649.

Key points about the trial:

1. **Establishment of the High Court of Justice**: Parliament passed a resolution to establish a High Court of Justice to try the king. This was unprecedented, as there was no legal basis or historical precedent for putting a reigning monarch on trial for treason by his own subjects.

2. **Charges**: Charles I was charged with treason and "other high crimes against the realm of England." The specific charge was that he had levied war against the Parliament and the people of England, leading to the deaths and destruction during the Civil War.

3. **Lack of Precedent**: The trial was unique because English law did not recognize the concept of trying a reigning monarch for treason. Traditionally, the king was considered above the law and answerable only to God. The creation of the High Court of Justice was a revolutionary act by the Parliamentarians.

4. **Outcome**: Charles I was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was executed on January 30, 1649, marking a significant moment in English history and the culmination of the conflict between the monarchy and Parliament.

In summary, Charles I was tried under a law specifically created by the Parliamentarians for that purpose, reflecting the extraordinary and revolutionary nature of the proceedings.

Yes, several laws and legal reforms profoundly impacted power in England following the Norman Invasion and the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Here are some key changes introduced by the Normans that reshaped English governance and society:

1. **Feudal System**: William the Conqueror introduced the feudal system to England, which restructured land ownership and governance. All land was held by the king, who granted it to his loyal barons and knights in exchange for military service and loyalty. This centralized power in the hands of the king and established a clear hierarchy of authority.

2. **Domesday Book (1086)**: Commissioned by William the Conqueror, the Domesday Book was a comprehensive survey of land and property ownership in England. It provided a detailed record of who held what lands and what resources were available, allowing the king to effectively tax and control the landholders.

3. **Curia Regis (King's Court)**: William established the Curia Regis, or King's Court, which served as the central court of justice and the king's advisory council. This body evolved over time into important institutions like the Parliament and the Royal Courts of Justice, centralizing legal and administrative authority.

4. **Forest Law**: The Normans introduced strict forest laws to protect royal hunting grounds. These laws restricted the use of forests and imposed harsh penalties for poaching, significantly affecting the lives of many commoners and asserting the king's control over large swathes of land.

5. **Castle Building**: The Normans built numerous castles across England to establish and maintain control over the land. These fortifications served as military strongholds, administrative centers, and symbols of Norman authority.

6. **Common Law Development**: Although the development of English common law is a later process, its foundations were influenced by Norman legal traditions. The Normans introduced more standardized legal practices and centralized the administration of justice, setting the stage for the future evolution of common law.

7. **Church Reforms**: William the Conqueror maintained control over the church by appointing Norman clergy and ensuring that church officials were loyal to him. This helped consolidate royal power over ecclesiastical matters and reduced the influence of the English church in political affairs.

These changes, implemented after the Norman Conquest, fundamentally altered the structure of English society, governance, and legal systems, centralizing power in the monarchy and laying the groundwork for future legal and administrative developments.

Prior to William the Conqueror, England was ruled by Anglo-Saxon kings. The period before the Norman Conquest in 1066 is known as the Anglo-Saxon period, which lasted from the early 5th century until the 11th century. Here are key aspects of the kings and royal systems that existed during this time:

### Early Anglo-Saxon Period (5th-7th centuries)

- **Heptarchy**: England was divided into several small kingdoms, collectively known as the Heptarchy. The main kingdoms were Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, and Sussex. These kingdoms were often in conflict with one another and had their own rulers.

### Notable Kings:

1. **Æthelberht of Kent (560-616)**: One of the first Anglo-Saxon kings to convert to Christianity, Æthelberht established laws that were among the earliest written codes in England.
2. **Rædwald of East Anglia (died c. 624)**: A powerful king who is believed to have had significant influence over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.
3. **Offa of Mercia (757-796)**: Known for constructing Offa's Dyke, a large earthwork separating Mercia from Welsh territories, Offa was a dominant ruler who exerted influence over much of southern England.

### Viking Influence (8th-11th centuries)

- **Danelaw**: During the late 9th and early 10th centuries, parts of England came under the control of Viking invaders. The Danelaw was an area of England under Danish control, where Viking laws and customs prevailed.

### Notable Kings:

1. **Alfred the Great of Wessex (871-899)**: Successfully defended his kingdom against Viking invasions and is credited with unifying much of southern England. He implemented important legal and military reforms.
2. **Æthelstan (924-939)**: Grandson of Alfred the Great, Æthelstan is often considered the first true king of a united England. He defeated the Vikings and other rivals to consolidate his rule over the entire country.
3. **Edgar the Peaceful (959-975)**: His reign was marked by internal peace and stability. Edgar is credited with further consolidating the kingdom and standardizing laws and coinage.

### Late Anglo-Saxon Period (10th-11th centuries)

- **House of Wessex**: The descendants of Alfred the Great continued to rule England, with occasional interruptions by Danish kings.

### Notable Kings:

1. **Cnut the Great (1016-1035)**: A Danish king who ruled over England, Denmark, and Norway, establishing a North Sea empire.
2. **Edward the Confessor (1042-1066)**: Known for his piety, Edward's death without a clear heir led to the succession crisis that ultimately resulted in the Norman Conquest.

### Governance and Society

- **Witan**: The king ruled with the advice of the Witan, or Witenagemot, a council of nobles, clergy, and other influential figures. The Witan played a role in advising the king and selecting new kings.
- **Earldoms**: England was divided into large territories called earldoms, each governed by an earl. These earls wielded significant power and often had their own military forces.
- **Shires and Hundreds**: For administrative purposes, earldoms were divided into shires (counties), each overseen by a sheriff. Shires were further divided into hundreds, which were units of land meant to support 100 households.

### Legal and Cultural Aspects

- **Legal Codes**: Anglo-Saxon kings issued legal codes that codified customary laws. These laws dealt with issues such as crime, property rights, and social obligations.
- **Christianity**: The spread of Christianity during the Anglo-Saxon period had a profound impact on culture, law, and governance. Monasteries and churches became centers of learning and literacy.

Overall, the Anglo-Saxon period was marked by a complex and evolving system of kingship, governance, and legal traditions that laid the foundation for the later development of English monarchy and law.

After the Restoration in 1660, Charles II became the king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The Restoration marked the return of the monarchy after a period of republican rule under Oliver Cromwell and his son Richard Cromwell, known as the Commonwealth and the Protectorate.

### Key Points about Charles II and the Restoration:

1. **Background**: Charles II was the son of Charles I, who had been executed in 1649 following the English Civil War. After his father's execution, Charles II spent years in exile in various European countries.

2. **Restoration**: In 1660, following the collapse of the Protectorate and a period of political instability, General George Monck, a key military leader, facilitated negotiations for the return of the monarchy. Charles II was invited to return to England and reclaim the throne.

3. **Coronation**: Charles II was formally crowned king on April 23, 1661, at Westminster Abbey.

4. **Reign**: Charles II's reign is often associated with a period of relative stability and the re-establishment of the monarchy, the Church of England, and many aspects of traditional English society that had been disrupted during the Interregnum. His reign also saw significant events such as the Great Plague of London (1665), the Great Fire of London (1666), and ongoing conflicts with the Dutch and the French.

5. **Legacy**: Charles II's reign is often referred to as the "Merry Monarch" period due to his court's reputation for its lively and hedonistic culture, a stark contrast to the puritanical rule of the Commonwealth. Despite this, his reign also faced significant political challenges and tensions with Parliament.

Charles II ruled until his death on February 6, 1685, after which his brother James II succeeded him.

The shift of power to Parliament and the Prime Minister, particularly regarding the authority to declare war, evolved over several centuries, but it became more pronounced in the 20th century. Here are the key developments in this transition:

### Early Developments

1. **Glorious Revolution (1688-1689)**: The Glorious Revolution significantly limited the powers of the monarchy and enhanced the role of Parliament. The Bill of Rights (1689) established parliamentary sovereignty, making it clear that the king could not rule without Parliament's consent.

2. **Act of Settlement (1701)**: This act further solidified the constitutional framework, ensuring that the monarchy would not interfere with parliamentary decisions.

### 18th and 19th Centuries

3. **Walpole and the Rise of the Prime Minister**: Sir Robert Walpole, often considered the first de facto Prime Minister (1721-1742), set precedents for the role of the Prime Minister within the framework of parliamentary government, although the monarch still retained significant influence.

4. **19th Century Reforms**: Various reforms throughout the 19th century, such as the Reform Acts, expanded the electorate and increased the power of the House of Commons relative to the House of Lords and the monarchy.

### 20th Century

5. **World War I and World War II**: These wars highlighted the necessity for the Prime Minister and Parliament to have decisive roles in war declarations and military engagements. The monarch’s role became more ceremonial as the elected government took on more direct control.

6. **Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949**: These acts further reduced the power of the House of Lords and strengthened the authority of the House of Commons, making the elected chamber more dominant in legislative matters, including decisions about war.

### Post-World War II Developments

7. **War Powers and the Prime Minister**: By the mid-20th century, it had become customary for the Prime Minister to seek Parliament’s approval before committing to major military actions. This was not a legal requirement but a matter of constitutional convention and political necessity.

8. **Iraq War (2003)**: The parliamentary debate and vote on the Iraq War in 2003 is a notable example of this convention. Prime Minister Tony Blair sought and received parliamentary approval before joining the US-led invasion, setting a modern precedent for such decisions.

### Recent Developments

9. **Fixed-term Parliaments Act (2011)**: Although primarily concerned with the timing of elections, this act is part of a broader trend of codifying aspects of parliamentary sovereignty and reducing the arbitrary powers of the executive.

In summary, while the exact date when Parliament and the Prime Minister gained the definitive power to declare war is not fixed, this authority gradually evolved, especially from the 17th century onward, becoming more firmly established in the 20th century. The modern expectation is that the Prime Minister will seek parliamentary approval for military action, reflecting the democratic principles underpinning the UK's constitutional framework.
