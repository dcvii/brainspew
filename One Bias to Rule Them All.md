### All cognitive biases = one of a handful of fundamental beliefs + confirmation bias

I can explain it only by a weakness of the scholarly mind that I have often observed in myself. I call it theory-induced blindness: once you have accepted a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws.

\-Daniel Kahneman (1934-2024)

Psychologists have posited hundreds of cognitive biases over the years, from hindsight bias to ingroup-outgroup bias to the fundamental attribution error. They’ve even proposed a “bias bias”: a tendency to overestimate the impact of cognitive biases on (other) people’s thinking. Inventing and cataloguing biases seems to be one of psychologists’ favorite pastimes.

But a fascinating [recent paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916221148147) by Aileen Oeberst and Roland Imhoff argues that all our cognitive biases boil down to one of a handful of fundamental beliefs, coupled with just one “ultimate” bias. The fundamental beliefs include such ideas as “I make correct assessments” and “I am good.” And the ultimate bias is *confirmation bias*: the tendency to seek and favor information consistent with one’s preexisting views.

In this post, I’ll look at a range of common cognitive biases, and the six fundamental beliefs that give rise to them.
