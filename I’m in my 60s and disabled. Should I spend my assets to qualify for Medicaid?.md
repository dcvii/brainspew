## I’m in my 60s and disabled. Should I spend down my assets to qualify for Medicaid?

### Dear Quentin,

I need your advice on a decision that is financially and ethically one of the most difficult I’ve ever had to make. As a child of the 1960s, I was born in a time when the elderly and disabled were hidden away in back bedrooms and institutions. All the better to allow the more “perfect” members of society to live the dream that life was rosy and gay.

Age, and my own life experiences, have left me physically disabled. I still take care of myself, manage my finances and maintain my house, car and two pets. I am debt-free and own two properties, one of which is listed for sale. My monthly budget is tight but currently manageable. I even balance my checkbook to the penny every month.

> ‘I was born in a time when the elderly and disabled were hidden away in back bedrooms and institutions.’

As technology advances, I find it more difficult to do things most people take for granted. Businesses, and pretty much everyone else for that matter, insist everything be done online. I’m now in my 60s. I used to rely on old-fashioned paper and pens. However, holding a pen is now painful and difficult. It can take days for me to write a simple letter.

I’ve been repeatedly asked, “Isn’t there a friend, relative or neighbor who can help you?” Woe to us who have none of the above helpful angels to ask for help. One lovely lady, whose job it is to be of help, actually insisted I go to my local high school, find the typing class and hire a student to do my letter-writing and computer entry for me.

### Spending down assets for Medicaid

Medicaid is going through major changes and doesn’t seem reliable. In today’s market, “spending down” my assets may require dumping my other property for peanuts, then wasting the profits and my savings on vacations I can’t take, luxuries I couldn’t keep and gifts that could be subject to the five-year look-back period.

It also goes against my principles to dispose of my assets just so the government will support me. Assisted-living facilities and nursing homes are under a great deal of financial strain these days. Just staffing them properly is becoming ever more difficult. I am low on the baby boomer totem pole, so it is doubtful there will be a bed available for me.

I worked and paid into Social Security. I raised my child. I pay my taxes and insurance, donate money and personal belongings, and say “please” and “thank you.” I even insist that the able-bodied cut in line ahead of me at checkout when all they have is two cases of beer. I canceled my pricey term life insurance and I changed my will to deter vultures.

Do I spend down my assets in the hope of receiving Medicaid? Do I try to move yet again, provided I can afford the moving costs? Do I move to a state that legally allows what I consider socially approved euthanasia? Do I keep bugging people whose job it is to assist the elderly and disabled? Or do I keep pestering kind folks like you?

Ms. Independent

### Dear Ms. Independent,

I do not advocate impoverishing yourself in an attempt to qualify for Medicaid. However, you may have other options.

We are all — most of us, anyway — temporarily abled. The time will come when we will age or experience an unexpected health event (or eventuality). I receive letters from people in your situation all the time. Some have a [terminal diagnosis like Alzheimer’s](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/my-sister-has-alzheimers-disease-how-can-i-make-sure-she-doesnt-fall-victim-to-scammers-06fa9b0b?mod=article_inline), while others are just trying to get through the day.

Your letter is welcome — I will listen to you anytime, and I read every word, even though the published version is edited somewhat — and it should serve as a reminder to those who might think about helping a relative, friend or neighbor (actions speak louder than thoughts) and who may themselves need help in the future.

> Some 11 states and D.C. offer medical aid in dying for those who suffer from chronic pain or who are terminally ill.

I admire your independence and your fighting spirit and, yes, your realism. You are looking at the future with a clear vision, poring over your options no matter how challenging they may be. Experiencing how helpful — or not — relatives, friends or heirs may be is a hard, but useful, realization afforded to people who are in ill health.

Some 11 states and Washington, D.C. offer medical aid in dying for those who suffer from chronic pain or who are terminally ill. You can read more about state-by-state laws. You wouldn’t need to worry about the financial, emotional or physical costs of moving: [Oregon and Vermont](https://apnews.com/article/assisted-suicide-vermont-residency-requirement-10ce4f29063f5bbb1873583f9aa89947) are two states that allow nonresidents to avail themselves of assisted suicide for the terminally ill.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump [said he would impose a 100% levy on imported pharmaceuticals](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-announces-100-tariffs-on-pharmaceuticals-unless-drug-makers-are-building-u-s-factories-a233958a?mod=article_inline) unless their manufacturers are actively building factories in the U.S. Writing on Truth Social, his social-media platform, the president said, “It is a vary unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process.”

### Medicaid eligibility

You could avail of the Medicaid Excess Income Program, if you are only slightly above the threshold for Medicaid. The income that exceeds Medicaid eligibility acts like a deductible. If you show that you have medical bills equal to your excess income in a particular month, Medicaid may pay your additional medical bills beyond that for the rest of that month, according to the Department of Health in New York.

You must be under 21 or 65 or older, certified blind or certified disabled, pregnant or the parent of a child under age 21, per the rules of New York State. These payments cover outpatient care, doctor and dental visits, lab tests, prescription drugs, and long-term care. There are rules for hospital stays. Read more [here](https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/excess_income.htm).

> Every state sets a home-equity interest limit to determine if a person’s home will be counted as a Medicaid asset.

Rules also vary by state on whether your 401(k) or IRA is a countable asset. [In California,](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Pages/Asset-Limit-Changes.aspx) the value of your 401(k) or IRA is not counted as an asset for Medicaid eligibility in nonpayout status. However, any income you receive from your 401(k) once it is in payout status does count toward the income limit. [In New York](https://www.ricafortelaw.com/library/how-ny-retirement-accounts-affect-medicaid.cfm), on the other hand, Medicaid will not count the principal value of your 401(k) or IRA as an asset or available resource, but only if you are taking required minimum distributions.

Every state sets a home-equity interest limit to determine if a person’s home will be counted toward or exempt from the Medicaid asset limit. Florida, New York and California, among other states, exempt a primary residence from assets calculated by Medicaid under certain circumstances. In many states, if a person or their spouse needs to live in the home or they have plans to return to it, it can remain exempt.

### Five-year look-back

As you say, there is a five-year Medicaid look-back period to review whether an individual divested themselves of assets in order to qualify for benefits. To be eligible, you must have no more than $2,000 in countable assets, which includes bank accounts and investments, and no more than $2,829 a month in income. [But there are different rules in different states.](https://www.eldercareresourceplanning.org/medicaid-faq/applying/over-assets/)

In New York, for example, people who are 65 or older or who are disabled have a $32,396 asset limit ($43,781 for couples). Monthly income eligibility for such Medicaid applicants is $1,800 for an individual and $2,433 for a couple. For community-based long-term care, there are stricter financial limits in that state.

> There is a five-year Medicaid look-back period to review whether an individual divested themselves of assets.

“Countable assets are calculated towards Medicaid’s asset limit,” says the [American Council on Aging](https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/medicaid-eligibility-new-york/). “This includes cash, stocks, bonds, investments, vacation homes, and bank accounts (i.e., checking, savings, money market). There are also exempt (non-countable) assets.” While one’s home may not be counted toward Medicaid’s asset limit, it may not be exempt from the Medicaid Estate Recovery Program.

It adds: “Exemptions generally include one’s primary home, personal belongings, household items, a vehicle, burial funds up to $1,500 or a life insurance policy with a cash value up to $1,500, and non-refundable pre-paid funeral agreements. In New York, IRAs and 401(k)s in payout status are exempt.”

### Common Medicaid mistakes

The [Jarvis law firm](https://jarvisfirm.com/avoid-medicaid-5-year-lookback/) in Lancaster, Ohio, lists common mistakes made by people planning to take advantage of Medicaid. Among them: waiting until care is urgently required; giving cash gifts above the tax-exemption limit or transferring property without understanding Medicaid rules; failing to take advantage of available exemptions; bad recordkeeping; and overlooking irrevocable trusts or other legal tools.

There are instances when a gift would be exempt from the Medicaid look-back period, including one made by a parent to their child who is blind, disabled or under the age of 21 or to what is termed a caretaker child who has lived in the individual’s home for at least two years.

> Annuities can also be used as part of Medicaid planning, if done with the guidance of an attorney or tax specialist.

Florida, among several other states, has enhanced life-estate deeds — known as “lady-bird deeds” — which automatically exempt all homes with such a deed from the Medicaid estate and remove the home from probate assets, thereby protecting the house from subsequent Medicaid asset-recovery efforts.

Another way to get around the Medicaid five-year look-back rule, depending on the laws of your state, is to transfer money to a pooled special-needs trust run by a charitable organization. Annuities can also be used as part of a Medicaid planning strategy, if done with the guidance of an attorney or tax specialist.

### Securing your financial security

Globally, approximately [46% of people age 60](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/12/1107102) and above have some kind of disability — and if more people were aware of that, they might see the person before the disability, and perhaps have more understanding about what it’s like to live in a world largely designed for people who do not have a disability (yet).

The world can be an unforgiving place. The [marriage rate for people with disabilities](https://www.vantagemobility.com/blog/dating-tips-and-sites-for-people-with-disabilities?fbclid=IwAR019dILqZnWg5SUPoykNQvAgXCcAKSeIvgI-1K8k2L_1pTG7H6YSFw3Apw) is lower than for the rest of the population, and people with disabilities also [get married later in life](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/well/family/dating-with-a-disability.html). This has implications for a person’s financial stability and mental health.

> I’m assuming your biggest concern is long-term care should you lose your ability to live independently.

You don’t say how much your house is worth or how much you have in a 401(k) or IRA. For that reason, I’m assuming your biggest concern is long-term care should you lose your ability to live independently. If that time comes, you can explore everything from a reverse mortgage to [continuing-care retirement communities.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/retirees-flock-to-these-communities-to-age-in-place-with-nice-perks-how-can-you-find-the-right-one-6e63cec2?mod=article_inline)

You have assets. You are debt-free and you have a child, who may or may not be supportive. You’ve come this far by yourself, I suspect — reading between the lines of your letter — and you have the willpower to keep knocking on doors and sending out emails seeking assistance. Here is a [list of organizations](https://www.sralab.org/lifecenter/resources/listing-advocacy-groups-people-disabilities) that may be able to help you.

It takes a lot of guts to ask for help. Please keep at it.
