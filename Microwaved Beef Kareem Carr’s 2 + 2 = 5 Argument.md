### A Quick Thank You

Thank you *so much* to everyone who [donated earlier this week](https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/make-the-world-a-little-bit-better). Check out this email I got from GiveWell:

> I’m so excited to share the first update on the GiveDirectly campaign! Three days in, 1,925 Substack readers have donated a total of $922,654 toward our $1M goal. Because the momentum has been so strong, we’ve decided to raise the target to encourage folks to keep giving through the end of the month. [Literature](https://home.uchicago.edu/ourminsky/Goal-Gradient_Illusionary_Goal_Progress.pdf) [shows](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/CriticalLinkTangibilityGenerosity.pdf) thermometers are most impactful at 66-80% full. You’ll see the fundraising thermometer update shortly!
> 
> **102 of your readers contributed $28,652.** As a reminder, this only includes donors who used your unique URL; some supporters you reached won’t show up in the tracked data.
> 
> If you’re feeling competitive: you’ve brought in the third-highest revenue (trailing only *Slow Boring* and *The Argument*) and the third-most donors (just 12 donors behind *Off Message*).

That is *insane*. While *Singal-Minded* is a bigger newsletter than I ever could have reasonably hoped, it is by no means huge. The fact that we can compete with the likes of Matt Yglesias is a true testament to your generosity. So thank you, thank you, thank you. (The folks who won the contest have been notified, by the way.)

On to today’s content, which is a quick take and which will double as my introduction of a new feature.

### Microwaved Beef: Kareem Carr’s 2 + 2 = 5 Argument

*Microwaved Beef is a sporadic feature in which I return, pettily, to things that annoyed me a while ago but which I didn’t say much about at the time.*

Maybe I’m cheating a little in this, the inaugural edition of Microwaved Beef, because the guy I have (ice-cold) beef with, Dr. Kareem Carr — and I should be clear that even when it had just come out of the oven, this beef wasn’t *particularly* spicy and entails no personal animus — is [Literally Asking For It](https://x.com/kareem_carr/status/1997332770691969251):

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbWG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F980593de-773b-47b1-92e4-bdb4446b0c32_888x768.png)

Those of you who aren’t too online probably need an explanation. Unfortunately, I’m not sure *exactly* what sparked this. I do know that in the summer of 2020, we were in the very depths of culture-war hell, and naturally, people started arguing over whether 2 + 2 = 5 on Twitter. Yes, really!

This is a famous example because, as most anyone reading this who was educated in the anglophone, (justifiably) Orwell-worshipping world knows, in *[1984](https://dn790002.ca.archive.org/0/items/NineteenEightyFour-Novel-GeorgeOrwell/orwell1984.pdf)* — spoilers for *1984* incoming! — Winston writes in his secret diary that “Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.” When The Party finds out he feels this way, it begs to differ — it seeks to break Winston by torturing him until he will say that two plus two actually equals five.

The lack of subtlety is part of the point, because this plotline touches on powerful questions: Are we free to say what’s true? Can totalitarian forces become so powerful that they melt down the very concept of consensus reality? And just how many awesome songs can be written that reference this equation? (Off the top of my head, at least two: “ [2 + 2 = 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w6kHS_IRrE) ” by Radiohead and “ [Run The Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4l0gJEBJMM) ” by El-P — “And If the party tells me five fingers then five is what I’ll say / No matter that the four displayed are waving in my face.”)

However the summer of 2020 2 + 2 = 5 Twitter blowup started, naturally — and I mean “naturally” in the sense that humans are stupid and annoying when they have been huffing culture-war fumes online — a number of “Uh, professor here!”–type “experts” responded *not* by saying “No, no one is saying 2 + 2 = 4; stop misrepresenting academia,” but instead... arguing that yes, 2 + 2 = 5. At least sometimes.

I call them the Fivers, and their arguments tended to be quite silly. I believe the *least* crazy one entailed a decimal-rounding system. Let’s imagine you add 2.4 to 2.4 and you’re working in a system where you round to the nearest integer. In this system, you could *more or less* say 2.4 + 2.4 = 5. So some in the Fivers (as I call them) started saying that this means 2 + 2 = 5. Even this answer entails a hamstring-injury level of stretching, though, because it involves basically leaving the numbers unrounded on one side of the equation and then rounding them on the other. (If you saw a saner 2 + 2 = 5 argument, please drop it in the comments.)

The reason this controversy annoyed me was because it reminded me of so many of the worst online arguments, which are often much more about fuzzy or shifting definitions, or superficially clever rhetorical moves, than about the actual thing being discussed. That’s totally what happened here. Setting aside your own personal politics and allegiances, it was basically:

**Non-wokes:** Those Wokes are so crazy and so detached from reality, they think 2 + 2 = 5!

**Wokes:** LOL I can’t believe you chose that example. Two plus two CAN equal five! I mean, just look at this example: \[example involves pretending there’s any ambiguity to what 2 + 2 means when you come across it in the wild, usually by either introducing an arbitrary rule — see above — or imagining “+” means something other than simple summation\]

Anyway, I don’t find Kareem Carr particularly annoying by the standards of the sorts of people who spend time debating the value of 2 + 2 on Twitter, but I did find his contribution to this debate — the one he’s now inviting people to chime back in on all these years later — particularly silly. And because he was a biostatistics PhD at Harvard at the time — later recognized by a Harvard publication as “ [Fighting misinformation one tweet at a time](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/fighting-misinformation-twitter-kareem-carr/) ” — I think he was taken more seriously than some other Fivers, at least among the sorts of people who were eager to find themselves on that side of the debate. (After all, some of the people who believe that 2 + 2 = 4 are *Trump voters*!)

He laid out his case in a Twitter thread that [started here](https://x.com/kareem_carr/status/1289724475609501697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1289724475609501697%7Ctwgr%5E04e8499a10fe681e50f657b7146732abed9cc41d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbeunbound.us%2Fblog%2Fharvard-two-plus-two-equals-five-kareem-carr%2F). If you squint, there are glimmers of decent points at various points in it, though Carr never fully fleshes them out. Those glimmers include things like: You should be really careful if you claim you’re able to quantitatively measure intelligence or aggression. Sure, totally. But that can be true and it can also be true that 2 + 2 = 4.

So let’s focus on his Fiverism:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!stD0!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63fbb691-bcf5-400d-b9fd-ec0ed9553c63_884x454.png)

What is the “tremendously deep point” here? If it is that “our quantitative measures” reference “real underlying things in the universe,” then that’s just... a restatement of “our quantitative measures,” no? What else could “our quantitative measures” mean other than “things we are measuring in the universe”?

As for the importance of “keep\[ing\] track of this when we use numbers to model the real world,” yes, but that’s the whole problem here! The “+” symbol, in this context, just means “do the function of adding these two values.” If presented raw, like, “2 + 2,” it doesn’t matter what the units are, and you can just confidently answer “4.” And when it comes to counting real-world quantities, there are all sorts of agreed-upon conventions that, if not followed, cause the whole thing to break down.

In the chicken example, let’s imagine that our task is counting the number of chickens in one enclosure. You go to the enclosure, which contains a hen and a rooster, and you bring to bear the full power of your intellect to point at each chicken and count “One... two.” One plus one equals two. You pull out a calculator to double check; you are correct.

Carr’s move of “A-ha — but what if you come back in a year and a chick has hatched!” isn’t remotely clever or deep. It’s just cheating! In this situation 1 + 1 = 3 only if we redefine the very meaning of the addition function. Obviously the same goes for the fox example. In that one, again, there’s this temporal thing going on that alters the meaning of the addition sign. He (or his “literal minded” observer) is saying “If one plus one equals two, then how is it that if I leave a fox and a hen together, I’m left with one animal? This shows that sometimes, 1 + 1 = 1.” But it really, really doesn’t! If our task is “count the number of live animals in the enclosure,” then at the moment the hungry fox is put in the enclosure with the unfortunate chicken, 1 + 1 indeed equals 2. After the attack, the number is just 1. If the chosen unit is “animals, live or dead,” then the value is 2 for the whole sequence. Simply by using normal conventions for math and defining units, I can describe the situation at every moment in time without any wacky, false-looking equations.

You’re not saying anything deep or interesting about math or measurement by pointing out that if you add, to the well-understood symbol “=,” doing your initial count, representing that on the left, waiting awhile to see what happens to your real-world quantities, and then counting again and providing that value on the right, then it might render otherwise false equations true, and vice versa! It’s like saying you proved 1 = 0 because you went to a different enclosure, counted one chicken, and then came back 50 years later and the chicken was long gone. This is all silly word games and redefinitions — again, like most dumb Twitter arguments.

Part of what’s annoying is that there are perfectly reasonable ways to use normal, agreed-upon math to explain these sorts of events! You can write a basic function F(h, r, t,... ) with number of hens, number of roosters, amount of time, and however many other variables you need to factor in things like probability of mating, average size of the resulting egg clutches, and so on, and predict the potential number of chicks that will be produced by a given configuration. Similarly, you could come up with a function F(c, f, t) for initial number of chickens, foxes, and time that outputs the number of chickens remaining at time t. *That* should be the insight here — that math provides us with wondrous tools for modeling the real world and translating it into a universally understood symbolic language.

Instead we got obfuscation, as we so often do!
