Tonight I installed the Claude Windows app to try the new Cowork feature. Just a few hours of using it has changed my view on AI and the web.

There will be no AI browser. Perplexity Comet and OpenAI Atlas are solving the wrong problem—stuffing AI into a browser when the browser itself is shifting from primary interface to background infrastructure. The browser is not disappearing. It is being demoted.

The AI app is the hub, not the spoke. You chat in one tab. In another, you connect your services—Drive, email, calendar, bank. Once connected, the AI doesn't need to go to those services on your behalf. It pulls them into the conversation. Your order history, your account status, your documents—they're available right where you're talking, because the services are piped directly into the app. In many cases, your services surface directly through the AI; in others, the browser becomes the viewport it opens when a third-party surface has no structured integration.

A browser is an enormous piece of infrastructure—rendering engines, security sandboxes, extension ecosystems, tab management, compatibility across millions of sites. This infrastructure exists to support arbitrary third-party code. An AI app doesn't need any of that. Building an AI browser means inheriting all of that complexity and risk for no clear advantage. Why take it on when you can let browser teams manage it and simply open a window when you need one?

And if, at some point, an AI app does need a more tightly integrated browser layer, it won't be a universal browser attempting to render the entire open web. It would be a constrained execution layer for authenticated tasks—something increasingly managed and maintained by AI agents rather than vast human teams.

The browser rose to dominance as the general-purpose runtime for interacting with the web. It rendered pages, managed your logins, ran code, and routed your attention across domains. But it required you to be the operator. It assumed navigation as the core interaction model. When your services connect directly into an AI that can hold intent, maintain context, and orchestrate actions across systems, navigation stops being the dominant mode. The browser does not vanish; it loses its status as the primary user-facing environment.

Every major platform will converge on this pattern. If Siri ever becomes what it promises to be, it will be exactly this kind of app—not a voice assistant bolted onto a phone, but a deeply integrated AI with your services connected and the agency to act across them.

The future isn't an AI-enhanced browser. It's consumer AI apps. Cowork is an early signal.
