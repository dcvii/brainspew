It is obvious to many people—on all sides of the political spectrum—that we have left one era and entered another. Our politics feels different—and so does our economy.

Some suggest that the change we are feeling is simply the end of the postwar 20th century—as seen in the decline of multilateral liberalism, a retrenchment of globalism, and the resumption of major international conflicts. Others, looking at our renewed economic dynamism, point out that the long period of relative technological stagnation, commonly dated to the early 1970s, is over, as evidenced by dramatic improvements in artificial intelligence and also in biomedicine. Still others, like [my colleague Niall Ferguson](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/win-new-cold-war-china-trump-niall-ferguson), suggest that the right way to think about this new era is according to the contest of global powers: as a new Cold War, where China replaces the Soviet Union as our key adversary.

My nerdier friends—those obsessed with AI and crypto and longevity—turn to science fiction. And Neal Stephenson and Isaac Asimov are indeed useful when it comes to understanding current trends and where we are headed next, whether it be educating children with AI tutors or trying to figure out how to regulate the robots.

But I would like to suggest looking in another direction: backward.

My unlikely nomination for the most relevant time and place today is 17th-century England.

England’s 17th century is one of the most important centuries any nation ever had. The era begins with some of the most profound creations of William Shakespeare: *Hamlet*, *Macbeth*, and *King Lear*. Harold Bloom insisted that Shakespeare is our most important and profound thinker—his output would be enough to distinguish England in that period. But he is just the beginning.  
  
The beginning of the Scientific Revolution of the West dates most closely to 17th-century southern England, including [Robert Hooke](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Hooke), Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton. In 1660 the Royal Society was established as an institution devoted to advancing science. This time and place is when the scientific method, systematic experimentation, and social institutions for science are first codified and implemented sustainably. It is not possible to catalog the number of social, economic, and even political changes that have come as a result. But among them would be modern medicine, rapid transport, electricity, plentiful food, and most of the comforts of our daily lives.

The radical changes do not end there. Economic historian Gregory Clark [has proposed](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/498123?casa_token=Aio7DPA3Jh0AAAAA%3Anx1iSij7xw0EAIyoTSVGQciS1tzV6KkgmaLqb9PMMn6jiS2XIVXe55JUIpFoe7iNBdFs1Mycoms&journalCode=jpe) that systematic, ongoing economic growth starts in England around 1640. We do not know exactly why it happened then, but a number of factors came together including relatively free labor markets, a nascent nation state with a mature legal system, a high volume of commercial activity, and freedom from foreign invasion. That time was a precursor of the later Industrial Revolution. For the first time, humans were managing an economy that gets richer (almost) every year—again an essential component of our world.

Are you impressed yet?

Yet another development from that century is the founding and colonization of British North America, later Canada and the United States. The expansion of colonialism also touched India, Ireland, and the Caribbean. For England, this was a momentous and idea-rich century, and those ideas—which included “America” itself, a notion held most clearly by Puritans seeking a sanctuary—have shaped the world for centuries and still are seeing an amazing run.

Other 17th-century English inventions or developments include a stronger notion of the rule of law ([Edward Coke](https://fedsoc.org/commentary/fedsoc-blog/let-us-remember-sir-edward-coke-and-give-thanks)), the rise of parliamentary power, the development of political parties, the creation of what would become the nation’s central bank (the Bank of England), and the chartering and growth of large corporations, such as the East India Company.

The rise of the modern nation-state typically is dated to the 17th century, and sometimes to the 1648 [Peace of Westphalia](https://www.britannica.com/event/Peace-of-Westphalia), although that agreement was not primarily an English development. Nonetheless the English started building out a fiscally sound state earlier and better than anyone else, thus beginning their ascent to global power and providing the paradigmatic model for the later successful countries to follow. That all stemmed from a country slightly smaller than the state of Alabama.  
  
Incredible developments, all. But what about for the human beings who actually lived through it all? Existence in 17th-century England was a little like that apocryphal Chinese curse: “May you live in interesting times.”

The second half of the 16th century was a more peaceful time for England. The reign of Elizabeth I was stable by historical standards, as religious warfare had settled down. In contrast, in the 17th century, the English executed a king (Charles I in 1649), experimented with nonroyal rule (Oliver Cromwell from 1653 to 1658), restored another king (Charles II in 1660), and saw another revolution in 1688, bringing William III and Mary II from the continent to rule the country, without a clear claim to the title. Uncertainty about political institutions remained high.

Ideologically, the English 17th century was weird above all else.

Millenarianism blossomed, and the occult and witchcraft became stronger obsessions. This was an age of religious and economic upheaval; King James I even wrote a book partly about witches called *[Daemonologie](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25929)*. The greater spread of pamphlets and books meant that witch accusations circulated more widely and more rapidly, and so the [1604 Witchcraft Act](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/early-modern-witch-trials/an-act-against-witchcraft/) applied harsher punishments to supposed witches.

People were more likely to fear imminent transformation, and new groups sprouted up with names such as “[Fifth Monarchy Men](https://londonhistorians.wordpress.com/2017/12/15/the-fifth-monarchy-men-and-a-lesser-known-london-uprising/),” devoted to the idea that a new reign of Christ would usher in the end of the world. Protestantism splintered, giving rise to Puritanism and numerous sects, many of them extreme.

Meanwhile, Roger Williams [brought ideas](https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&psid=1358) of free speech and freedom of conscience to America, founding what later became the state of Rhode Island. The development of economics as a science with an understanding of markets (credit [Nicholas Barbon](https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/barbon.htm) and [Dudley North](https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/north.htm)) dates from that time, as do the first libertarians, namely [the Levellers](https://mises.org/mises-wire/levellers-first-libertarians), a liberty-oriented group from the time of the English Civil War.

All of these developments were supported by the falling [price of printing](https://cyberartsweb.org/cpace/infotech/asg/ag14.html), giving rise to an extensive use of pamphlets and broadsheets to communicate and debate ideas, often in [London coffeehouses](https://www.walks.com/blog/history-of-london-coffeehouses/). Johannes Gutenberg [had built](https://www.worldhistory.org/Johannes_Gutenberg/) the printing press for Europe much earlier, in the middle of the 15th century—but 17th-century England was the time and place when a commercial middle class could start to afford buying printed works.

War was frequent as well. There was an [Anglo-Spanish War](https://www.helion.co.uk/conflicts/anglo-spanish-war-2.php); three [Anglo-Dutch Wars](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095413510); the [Nine Years’ War](https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/nine-years-war), which included King William’s War in the colonies; and periodic involvement in the [Thirty Years’ War](https://www.worldhistory.org/Thirty_Years%27_War/) on the continent, as well as the aforementioned domestic civil wars, coups, and clashes over who would rule the country.

At the end of all this trouble, England was a fundamentally transformed nation. You would rather have been born there in 1800 than in 1550, but it wasn’t easy along the way. Excess thrills and excess chaos would be one simple way of describing the English 17th century.

What today is parallel to these developments? So much. But most of all: the sense of both radical progress and also pending disorder.

The artificial intelligence revolution is our version of the Scientific Revolution. It is not going to stop anytime soon, and we will assign more and more tasks to intelligent machines. Like the earlier revolution, with enough time it is likely to change everything, including productivity, the operation of the workplace, education, healthcare, and government.

The artificial intelligence revolution is also a major extension of the Scientific Revolution. Researchers are bringing AI to bear on scientific advances, most of all in the biosciences. We will use AI tools to discover new biomedical innovations at a more rapid pace, and beat back many of the maladies that plague the human race. In the 17th century, it was the Scientific Revolution that laid the foundations for what later became modern medicine. We are now doing a more advanced version of that same transformation.

If the 17th century was the first time the printing press achieved potency for injecting ideas into individual minds, in our time Large Language Models and their offshoots will perform that role. Tens of millions of people right now chat with them, ask them questions, and use them as therapists, and there are millions of AI boyfriends and girlfriends. You can have dialogues with Albert Einstein or Winston Churchill, in their AI forms of course. Deep Research will write you a 10-page report, on the topic of your request, at the level of a McKinsey brief, and requiring only about 10 minutes. Many of these services are free, and even most of the more advanced plans do not cost more than $20 a month. Everyone who wants their own printing press has it at their disposal, and they do not have to create or even commission the writing.

An intellectual and also spiritual revolution may come from this, but as it was for Englishmen in the 17th century, it’s difficult for us to predict which movements and ideologies will be favored. The basic change is that computers now produce interesting ideas more cheaply and rapidly than before, just as in 17th-century England the printing press produced interesting ideas, through the medium of pamphlets, far more cheaply than ever before.

Today we can expect a much further proliferation of new and diverse ideas, ranging from the brilliant to the bizarre to the possibly destructive. We are on the verge of artificial general intelligence, which outperforms human experts in virtually any field, but there is also an alleged transgender murder cult—[the Zizians](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy83958r2d0o)—obsessed with the risks of AI. Belief that UFOs are alien has surged. In religion proper, it is no surprise that the number of exorcisms is [continuing to rise](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/vatican-to-hold-training-next-month-as-demand-for-exorcism-continues-to-rise-catholic-church-prayer-ritual-priests-internation-association-of-exorcists-paranormal-supernatural-psychiatry-mental-health). [Bryan Johnson](https://www.thefp.com/p/bari-weiss-bryan-johnson-how-not-to-die-in-2025) states his intention to create a new religion based on the idea of immortality, and he is not booted out of mainstream discourse. I would not be surprised if super-smart, super-compassionate (and sometimes stern) AIs turn out to be the oracles of the future. Most of all, we are seeing a proliferation of sects, as did England in the 17th century, except many of those groupings are nominally secular.

As for politics, we already are seeing the older shibboleths dissolve. The current Republican coalition is extremely ideologically diverse, and it is held together primarily by a loyalty to Donald Trump. In the group are anti-globalists, tech accelerationists, culture warriors, DOGE and Elon Musk loyalists, [Catholic integralists](https://uscatholic.org/articles/201910/what-is-catholic-integralism/), anti-immigrationists, anti-abortion activists, tax-cutting types, and yes, [racists and antisemites](https://www.thefp.com/p/liberals-warned-me-about-magas-racism). The term “[zombie Reaganism](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-stage-is-set-for-zombie-reaganism-to-rise-from-the-grave/)” is now common, and the consensus that once characterized the Republicans—including veneration of Reagan himself—is long gone.

The intellectual status of the Democratic Party is less clear, as right now those forces are suffering from malaise and low approval ratings. While I would prefer that the [Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson](https://www.thefp.com/p/ezra-klein-and-derek-thompson) “abundance agenda” take over the party, more likely the currently dispirited intellectual state of affairs will be followed by fragmentation and the Democrats’ own version of a multiplication of sects. It is telling that ESPN sports commentator Stephen A. Smith has, [in prediction markets](https://frontofficesports.com/stephen-a-smith-has-fourth-best-gambling-odds-to-be-2028-democratic-presidential-nominee/), at times had decent odds for being one of the leading Democratic candidates for the nomination. Smith has not announced any candidacy, but he speaks (or rather, shouts) his mind, and he is not associated with the traditional progressive left. It is not that we should expect the ascendancy of Smith in particular; rather, the field is open to just about anyone who has the daring and who can strike an emotional chord with voters.

No matter what your political views, it is possible to sympathize [with this remark](https://x.com/ByrneHobart/status/1903088967920111687) from tech writer Byrne Hobart: “Looking at progress in AI models and the state of political discourse makes me wonder if there’s a finite amount of intelligence in the universe and we just moved a bunch of it around.”

In the 17th century, England started to colonize North America. In our century, America may start to colonize space.

In the 17th century, English economic growth moved from an average of zero percent a year, to something less than 1 percent a year, but positive on a regular basis. At some point within the next few decades, as artificial intelligence improves and is incorporated into more human institutions, we can expect our growth rates to rise from an average of about 2 percent a year to something higher. No one knows how much higher, but that will shock our systems just as economic growth drove the evolution of centralized English political power and decentralized English economic prosperity. Even if the rate of economic growth rises by only one percentage point a year, or half a percentage point, when compounded over 30 or 40 years, that implies a fundamentally transformed world, relative to the prior default path.

We are all going to be shocked; we just do not yet know how quickly. Imagine a world where most current jobs do not exist, extreme intelligence and counsel is on tap for free to everyone, any government that wants to can make the right decisions, and your children might be raised by AI-driven teddy bears.

The bad news is that most new technological advances, however positive their constructive uses, end up being applied to war as well. That has been true of fire, the wheel, electricity, the airplane, nuclear energy, and many more developments. As for AI, we already see it [weaponized through drones](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-rush-for-ai-enabled-drones-on-ukrainian-battlefields). In history, sooner or later one of the world’s powers has tried to use new technologies to obtain a decisive advantage in warfare. We should expect that to happen again. It is too early to conclude that the rate of warfare is now permanently higher, but with major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and with Taiwan under threat, [Steven Pinker’s promise](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/03/pinker-explains-the-long-peace/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CViolence%20has%20been%20in%20decline%20for%20long,era%20in%20our%20species%27%20history%2C%E2%80%9D%20Pinker%20said.&text=Pinker%20attributed%20the%20long%20decline%20in%20violence,police%20and%20court%20justices%20to%20resolve%20disputes.) of an ever more peaceful world seems to be receding.

There is also a downside to the advances in the biosciences, as bad actors may convert those innovations into bioterror attacks or possibly there will be accidents. When it comes to Covid, the lab leak hypothesis, in which the virus resulted from high-tech gain-of-function research, continues to grow in plausibility.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0510eaa5-28b3-4b3e-b55a-da9af4d0b2fc_1320x30.png)

The differences between today’s America and 17th-century England are obvious, ranging from living standards to our democratic institutions to women’s rights and much higher literacy and education standards, among many other factors. Still, a look at the 17th century reminds us that truly fundamental change recurs in history. America has been living through a long period of relative stasis, starting from the end of World War II. That has been a wonderful time to be alive, and we now take that peace and prosperity for granted. We should not. If you are giving job advice to your children or grandchildren, you are no longer sure what kind of world you should be telling them to prepare for.

I suspect that when we arrive in the year 2100, people will be very glad to have been born then, rather than in, say, my birth year of 1962, or for that matter in 2025. American life expectancy will be 90 or higher, and life will be richer and more interesting. Leisure time will be far more common and widespread. Humanity may be exploring the solar system and terraforming the earth; climate change as a major problem may be a distant memory.  
  
But the path getting there, as in earlier England, is going to be tricky. It won’t be as predictable and easy to manage as the America I have seen in my life.

We have not in a long time had a future where the past seemed so relevant.
