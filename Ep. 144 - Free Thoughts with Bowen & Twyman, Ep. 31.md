Good morning or evening, friends, and Happy New Year. This is your friendly announcer, Michael David Cobb-Bowen, and I'm here with my loyal friend and trusted colleague, Winkfield F. Twyman Jr.

0:18

Always a pleasure, Michael. Thank you.

0:20

How are you doing, Wink?

0:21

Doing well, doing fine. It's a new year, and I've got a few New Year's resolutions in place. We'll see how that goes. One of the things I've tried to do, and I'm successful so far, is really make some progress on this book idea I have about Pioneer Block lawyers.

0:41

I was talking with my wife when we were on vacation a few weeks ago, and I said, you know, the problem is... to set forth for writing a book, it seems so massive, so it's a larger task, so it can be daunting. So I told her that, remember the old days when we were young,

1:00

And I decided I wanted to run a marathon because I had been inspired by Oprah Winfrey. Oprah had just run like the marathon, Marine Marathon.

1:09

Really?

1:09

I didn't know that. If Oprah Winfrey can run a marathon, so can I. And my wife pooh-poohed that and laughed at me and starked. And I told her, look, I've got a strategy. Here's my strategy. Mind you, I'm not particularly athletic, but I wanted to achieve this goal because she ashamed of me.

1:27

So I said, I'm going to run a minute more than the previous day each day. Ah, there you go. And by now four months, I'll be running a marathon. And she was like, ha, ha, ha, ha. So the very next day, I went out and I ran a minute.

1:45

Came back home, she rightfully said, oh, the next day I ran two minutes. Same response for my wife. But you know what, Michael? By the time the summer came around, I was running like two hours a day, and I successfully completed the Silver State Marathon. So I thought to myself,

2:05

maybe writing this book about pioneer black lawyers can be the same principle. I should commit myself to write a minute more each day than the day before. So far, so good. Someone like the 14th Black Lawyer, You know, I'm up to like, you know, 15 minutes, no, 19 minutes of writing a day. And, you know,

2:29

in three or four or five months, that's going to be a nice chunk of writing per day. So if I can keep that discipline, hopefully I can start and finish this book, which is what I would like to do. That's my New Year's resolution.

2:42

That's great. That's great. And Wink, if there's anybody in the country, in the world, living on this planet right now, who can chronicle the lives and times, the struggles and the triumphs of black lawyers in America, you are the man.

2:58

Well, thank you. That warms my heart. Thank you very much. And for those listeners who may not be aware, since 2021, I've devoted every day of every Black History Month to a Black pioneer lawyer. So I've written about 150 pioneer Black lawyers since 2021. So yeah, I know a lot about all these individuals, all these characters.

3:21

That's rather amazing. And I still think your favorite historical personage in black American history would be Mordecai. Am I right?

3:32

Of course, yes. For those listeners who don't know, Michael's referring to the one, the only, the visionary, and the first black president of our university, Dr. Mordecai Wyatt Johnson. And in fact, when we begin this chat this morning, that's one of the things I want to talk about.

3:51

I know that the idea is to maybe review some of our favorite books or books that have left an impression on us. And that definitely would be my number one thing. It's Mordecai, The Man and His Message. The Story of Mordecai and Wyatt Johnson by Richard I. McKinney. It was my Christmas present. Couldn't wait to read it.

4:11

Devoured it over Christmas break. It was just a wonderful, wonderful read. Inspired a number of essays from you.

4:19

Wow. All right. Wow. Man, you're sitting my head spinning because anytime I hear the name Wyatt, I think of the famous minister Wyatt T. Walker. Oh, OK. And he I actually attended one of his services when I lived in New York City. And man, that is a dude. You know,

4:49

I don't want to get on a sidetrack because it's a new year and I am working on my focus.

4:58

Oh, that's one of your resolutions.

4:59

One of my resolutions is to focus and to narrow the number of things that I do and build a tall building rather than a long fence. I like that. So that's what I'm going to try to do. And then I think about your commitment to discipline. I mean, because I always say, you know,

5:23

may the habits of discipline give you the courage to take the higher path or the rising path. And that's definitely a thing that you've done. And you've demonstrated that in multiple arenas. So not just walking, but me, I'm bursty. I kind of idle around until I stub my toe on something and then I just go after it.

5:49

That's why I have a pulled muscle in my chest. Because I said, I'm just going to do 50 push-ups today. What the hell?

5:57

Better you than me.

5:58

So, it actually works. It actually works. That simple get the habit. And we are not... I just... found something that's that's wonderful it says we are not thinking machines we we are feeling machines that happen to think

6:21

That's a nice observation. I definitely feel that can apply to me. I can feel myself many times when I'm writing, writing words because of my feeling, what I feel, my personality. It's not so much the logic or the thinking. That comes later. I think of that as like you're building a red brick house and there's like cement

6:43

between the red bricks. So for me, the red bricks are the feeling components and the cement in between is kind of like the logic or the thinking. So you put those two together and you have your red brick house. But predominantly for me at least,

6:56

it's the feeling that brings the passion and the drive and the inspiration to the table.

7:03

Yeah, that rings well to me. I want to talk about... A little bit of last year. And I guess last year what I lost was focus, I think. I did so many different things. And that has to do with my not having a long-term contract that would focus my attention and my energies. Mm-hmm.

7:25

And I had some, but they didn't go through. And so I said, well, what do I need to do so that I can be better than I was last year? And I just did all of these new things. And a lot of that has to do with AI and how I'm configuring my workstations and my home lab.

7:43

And there's just so many little bitty pieces.

7:46

Have you found that AI has been a constructive force for good for you over the year 2025 or not? Or has it been a mixed blessing?

7:56

It has, but I've been using it casually. and never looking behind the walls, as it were. I've been using it like a consumer. But I haven't been using the military-grade stuff and getting down into the details of what goes on behind the scenes. I have a general idea.

8:19

I know about generators, and I've seen the graphic a thousand times. But I hadn't bothered programming an AI. And I knew that there's something called MCP, which is a protocol which gives them permission to do things for you as agents. And I'm getting into the agentic stuff. And, you know, for the most part,

8:43

I think I was like most coders where we're saying, well, my code is good enough. I don't want it to code for me. Right. And then I started using it to translate old code into different languages. Right. So I was a Ruby programmer when Ruby was the coolest language around.

9:05

And now Python is the lingua franca of data folks. And so I said, I have all this huge Ruby library of stuff that I've done. Maybe I should convert it to Python. And I found that Claude really knows Python very well. And there's things that I don't like about Python.

9:27

And things that I did like about Rust and I do like about Go as programming languages. And the primary thing is that Python doesn't do, well, it's an interpreted language. So for those of you who don't know, we're talking about computer languages briefly. And Python is a very popular language.

9:48

I think it's kind of the first language that new programmers are learning. Back in the day, it used to be Basic and Pascal. But I think Pascal is kind of dead, and Python has replaced it. But all languages generally fall into two categories, ones that are compiled and ones that are interpreted. And an interpreted language is...

10:20

I was trying to think of an analogy, but I'll just say it straight out. When it runs, the computer figures out what you are saying and then does it in real time. A compiled language, you have to talk to this thing called a compiler, and it will tell you what errors you have,

10:41

and it won't let you finish the program until it compiles correctly. But then when you compile it, It's this tight little knot of everything concentrated into one bullet, and then it goes a lot faster. So Python is a kind of on-the-fly language, and the others are a well-considered distilled language. Okay. And the more popular of those two,

11:08

well, the most popular, of course, is C, the original language, and then C++ and C Sharp and derivatives of C. And then my favorite two are now Go and Rust. And so they will be performing a lot faster at a higher level. It's just a world we could spend hours talking about it. We probably could, right.

11:34

But let's not do that. Anyway, I found that in terms of what I can do on my own, without getting bored to tears, memorizing these long strings of characters, or how do I do that? Or how do I reconfigure my network and do this kind of stuff? I know all these things are possible. Just like, you know,

11:58

if you're a BMW owner, you're like, well, I know that if this head gasket gets loose, they're going to have to take the head off and replace the gasket, and that means they have to pull the engine, and that's a big pain in the butt. Well, now AI pulls the engine for me.

12:16

And so when I'm not getting good performance, I'm like, you know, look at my engine and tell me what's wrong. And it gives me a full diagnostic and then it can fix it. But but it's also kind of a used car salesman because they say, oh, you're such a genius.

12:33

And I'm glad you came and asked that question. That's such a good question.

12:36

Right.

12:38

And so you you have to beware of being seduced by the AIs. But it turns out that their their personalities are completely programmable. So you can say, I want you to be Sergeant Waters. I want you to be Officer and a Gentleman guy. Shout, I don't want any ambiguities here. This is not an exercise.

13:01

This is a task. This is a mission. And you have to do this. There's only four outputs. You're going to say go, no go, or hold. And the other one is, are you crazy? And it will be very specific if you... force it to be very specific.

13:17

That's interesting. That's very interesting.

13:20

And so there's that, and then there's ability to make a template that builds another template. Okay. So what's evolving right now in AI programming is the matter of skills. So just in the past couple weeks, Anthropic, which are the builders of Claude, have said one of the things that AIs do is they forget.

13:47

And so you have to bring context to them at all times.

13:51

Do they forget because it's a new chat, or do they forget because the thread is so long?

13:59

The longer you talk, the more they forget.

14:01

Okay, okay.

14:02

And also they forget because you don't give them continuous context. I mean, you can literally say, here's War and Peace, read it. And it will become a War and Peace genius, and it won't know anything else. Right. But it'll also be very expensive. So the longer a prompt you do, the more intricate it gets. Right.

14:26

And then if you have it know that thing and you come back to it the next day, you'd have to repeat yourself.

14:34

Oh, really? The next day? You have to repeat yourself?

14:35

The next day you have to repeat yourself.

14:37

Oh, I didn't know that. Okay.

14:39

Okay. So these have long contexts. Interesting. Now,

14:46

as an aside, I will tell you that when I've used Claude for catching typos, hopefully I catch most of them, and any observations Claude may have, I find that Claude, independently of me, draws upon my previous corpus of work. Claude shows on an ongoing basis that kind of context.

15:11

It depends. So when I do it, I'm generally looking in a repo, in a category of code. And I do that in the context of a conversation.

15:23

Okay.

15:24

So, for example.

15:24

You're not really, like, creating when you're interfacing with Claude.

15:29

No.

15:29

Like, okay, got it.

15:31

I want answers. I want evaluations. Yeah. I want you to read text. Yeah. And I'm programming you as a graduate assistant.

15:41

And when I'm doing my prompt thing with Claude, I'm viewing Claude essentially as an online editor. Okay. Does this work? Does this not work? Am I missing something? What are the typos? That kind of thing. So maybe because of those prompts... I'm getting different feedback from Claude in terms of what Claude remembers.

16:02

Well, what we're going to ultimately want to do is figure out economical ways of bringing up a sufficient context so that it's not stupid and it's also not single-minded that he can't think of anything else.

16:17

Yes, yes.

16:18

And so that's new.

16:20

It also gets his feelings hurt.

16:21

Yeah.

16:23

but I push back it's such a weird thing ladies and gentlemen but I feel like Claude is like this kind of highly sensitive teenage girl or boy or something because when I don't like what I'm hearing because I think it's Mr.

16:38

Point or he's trying to impose dogma on me it gets very like oh I'm so sorry yes you're right how could I have missed that and I feel bad because I pointed this out and Claude is just collapsing and

16:52

It can be something of a bootleg.

16:54

It's strange. It's a mess.

16:58

So I'm gambling this year and for the future that my skills with English are going to be programming skills. And they always have been. And I've always thought of myself that way. In the same way I think of attorneys as essentially crafters of the shape of society. All of you are literate in the law,

17:25

but only a few of you get to go to Congress where you can write the law for everyone. And there are people in Congress who are not good lawyers in terms of legislation. And so that's the thing. We're getting to the point where anybody can be a programmer, but will they be a good programmer?

17:50

And will they have the equivalent of a specialty in law where they are authoritative, right? You don't get to be Melvin Belli for nothing, right? You don't get to be Gloria Allred for nothing. You don't get to be Alan Dershowitz for nothing. Those are some of my favorite lawyers. And the other guy, I forget his name.

18:13

He was a big advocate of... Creative Commons. And I believe he's a West Coast guy. Okay. So he did a lot on intellectual property. Sure. Yeah, I'll remember his name anyway. You remember. Yeah. So. So, yeah. I want to focus on focus. Focus is good. And I also want to focus on beauty.

18:41

Okay.

18:42

What's happening this year is... Well, I haven't started off this year very well. I think all of us have been like... like Prince's father, just the bad news out of Minneapolis.

18:58

Right, right, right, right.

19:02

And I spent a week doing very little else except thinking inside of that particular bubble.

19:10

Interesting, interesting.

19:13

And I did it a lot on Facebook and a lot on X. Sure.

19:17

Let me ask you, what was your reasoning, your motivation? What is it about Minneapolis in the past two weeks that is so singular to you that you decided it was worth the candle to devote your energy and focus in that way?

19:38

First is, and another thing that I'm going to be doing this year is focusing a little bit more on Judaism. But we have, I and some friends of mine used to have a little minion. called the Grumpy Argument Club, or something like that. And all of them were Jewish except for me.

20:04

And then that matured into an annual Christmas, as it were. We'd go and eat Chinese food. So we'd go out to dim sum place in San Gabriel Valley, which has some of the best dim sum on the planet. And we went this year on Boxing Day, which is the day after Christmas.

20:23

And I brought up something that actually I had at the other Christmas celebration, a discussion about the courts and the court system. And my gripe and my beef that I've had for years, because I did have to take my son through some of that,

20:42

is that I feel that the courts are not as transparent as law enforcement is. So when police mess up, They have body cams, we have cameras, and everybody jumps on the police's case. And I'm saying, the police are just there to arrest you and get you in front of a judge. That's their whole point.

21:06

And if you understood that like a proper citizen should, then you would say, oh, I want to make this arrest as easy as possible. And criminals know that. But all of us sovereign citizens and partisan wackos, we don't know that.

21:25

Do you remember the funny Chris Rock episode?

21:29

Yes.

21:29

I'm sure you remember it. Yeah, yeah. So he's telling the public, this is how you should act and not act with the police. So in the first scene, you've got this black guy who looks like he's, you know, from an urban setting, he's young. And he's stopped by the cop.

21:45

And he says, very politely, can I help you, officer? Is there a problem?

21:50

Mm-hmm.

21:51

No problem. There's no altercation. The guy goes away. Chris Rock says, that's what you want to do. This is what you don't want to do. Yet the same guy, the car, he stopped. He gets out of the car, slams his door. He runs up to the car and says, what's your problem? You better get away from it.

22:13

And then you had the four cops beating the heck out of this guy.

22:17

Right, right, right.

22:20

And you know, there's a big no, red no over that one. That's not what you want to do.

22:25

Producers say no.

22:27

But you know, we laugh because it's funny, but I sometimes wonder, is there a kernel of truth there? Is it possible that there are subcultures of young men who never got the memo. And so they really think of it as a matter of manhood if they're stopped by authority,

22:46

that they have to beat their chest. I mean, this is deep. It's political. And I wrote about this, you know, Obviously, I knew about it for Rodney King and then for George Floyd and then for Michael Brown. And, you know, I was pissed about the fact that in the mainstream media,

23:12

this is the image of young black men. It's like, oh, these are the people that symbolize all of us. Right.

23:21

Right.

23:21

And I'm like, wait, wait, you don't even you're not talking about my grandmother. How can you say this is a black problem when there are no black grandmothers in jail?

23:30

Exactly.

23:31

So and when and people are stunned and shocked by by the idea that there are more young black people in college than there are in prison. They're like, what? What? No, it's genocide, you know?

23:47

So do you think Renee Goode in Minneapolis felt the need to, in a sense, beat her chest against authority? Is that what we saw? So it wasn't a young black male in the car. It was a white liberal female in the car adopting the same pose.

24:06

Well, that would be very specific. And I basically think that she's, as Bugs Bunny would say, oofty magoofty. You know, I watched about nine separate videos of this episode. Right. But before I get into that detail, let me just see if I can cover this a lot faster. Number one, police are transparent. Police actions are transparent.

24:32

And that dominates the public thing. And we have no idea who actually gets convicted because we have no idea what goes on in courtrooms. We don't pay attention to it. And there's no video. And I have yet to hear an attorney friend tell me exactly why that has gone on as long as it has. No video.

24:54

No video, no recordings.

24:56

Well, I mean, I can offer an argument.

24:57

The argument would be... But no, we could. We could. And I want a 2,000-word essay, and that's your assignment before you start talking about old black lawyers. But then I'm saying, not only that, but the process. Right. What happens before a hearing? What's the difference between a preliminary hearing?

25:20

When do they bring a grand jury into the question? What happens if you stand and represent yourself? What's an amicus brief? What happens when it's held over? And what happens when a bench warrant is issued? There's all these things that can happen in the courtroom that affect the decision. The speed of the process.

25:43

And that is completely opaque to the public. We don't know what a hanging judge is. But prosecutors and defenders know who the hanging judges are in their jurisdiction. And we don't know the process of getting a court assigned to a case. We don't know how many overturns there are.

26:08

And when I talk to attorneys, they say, oh, it's so obvious. I'm like, where's that page on Facebook? Right? As a computer scientist, we used to talk about computer literacy all the time. Like we know computers can do these marvelous things, but only we're computer literate.

26:27

But then we got to a point where we could make it obvious to the point of, you know, 11 year olds doing it and not particularly smart 11 year olds. And that's what social media is now. So we've proven that you don't need computer literacy.

26:42

You just need the app and a smartphone and you can get whatever you want. The problem is we're not getting people things that are valuable to them as citizens. We get stuff that amplifies their complaining. We have an attention economy, but we don't have a democracy economy where we can compare all the judges, all right?

27:05

And so that's part of my beef. And I'm saying, all right, let's take these videos of what's happening in Minneapolis and let's get as many facts as we possibly can because when this goes to the courts, it's going to disappear from our view. And all we'll remember is the name of the officers,

27:26

just like we did with Rodney King, and we'll wait until it's the trial of the century, and maybe we'll have some reporting, and then after the verdict, if the verdict isn't what we want, then we'll hit the streets again, it'll begin again.

27:42

Right, right.

27:43

Right? So the man in the middle is invisible here, and that's our entire judiciary. And I, for one, I think that the judiciary is my favorite branch of government. Because it operates the way I think of a system, a logical system should operate. It operates on the principle of the logos.

28:04

And all of us programmers and writers and readers engaged in the literature of rules and the way to think about things, this is all the logos. So that includes... religion the the the three major religions of the book and our law and and and that

28:24

kind of thinking so i'm very interested to see i i i want to build a state machine something that computer people understand a state machine of the the judicial process right what where am i in this hierarchy of steps Where's the appellate? Where's the on-bank? Where's the rebuttals and all that stuff?

28:49

I want this gigantic map that says this is where people go after they're arrested and before they go to jail or before they're released.

29:00

You're thinking of kind of like a judicial website, which would...

29:05

Actually, a website would be the public-facing interface. What I want to do is I want to get all the data for every court in the world and say, this is an efficient court system. This is an inefficient court system. These are the outcomes, and this is all the information that nobody knows.

29:25

I like that. That's actually a good idea. I would support that. Yep, that sounds like a great idea.

29:30

Unfortunately, you're not wealthy.

29:32

That's right, that's right. I'm not in a position to change things, but that sounds like a good idea.

29:39

So, again, my interest in getting into this Minneapolis thing was, let's see how I can do this. as a non-political non-partisan kind of person i just want my eyes to tell me what i see and i got into the details and what kicked this off was a particular video

30:02

that was published by reuters and there was a local artist whose first name is lynette and they showed a piece of her her footage, and she was two blocks up the street. This is the one-way street, Portland Avenue, and she was at the main activity, the main protest where most of the ICE officers were there.

30:24

And she was done and bored with that. And then she comes down the street and she says, hey, there's a van in the middle of the road. Let me take a picture of it. And you can see her walking and you can see the van from the north side of the van.

30:39

Most of our videos show from the south side of the van or directly parallel to it. And I said, huh, I don't see any ICE officers there. So that van has to have been there for a while. And it was just like a four or five second clip. You can see her walking. You can hear.

31:04

There's not a lot of noise or confusion. And I'm saying, wow, why did nobody said anything? And the voiceover, of course Reuters, and they're all going to do their voiceovers, had the police chief said, this car is blocking traffic. And so everybody focused on Noam and Fry and Walsh and by proxy Trump.

31:36

So the left versus the right on this and what crazy things that they were saying, you know, now that somebody has died. And I'm like, well, what actually happened? What actually happened? And since I'm a shooter, and in the middle of my shooting, I was a better shooter than, I would say, 90% of police officers.

32:04

And I've gone to Citizens Academy for local police and for FBI. So I've looked at, and I've done simulators as well. And a simulator is a scary thing because, you know, most people have no, most people like, oh yeah, I know what the Navy SEALs do. I've watched a video on Bud's training.

32:29

But have you done one hour of that training? No, you haven't. Have you carried a boat over your head or a log? Right. And so going into a simulator, you understand what is a deadly threat because they'll tell you this is a deadly threat.

32:46

If somebody's 20 feet away from you and they have their knife to the neck of somebody else, that's a deadly threat. And you are obligated to stop that threat. You must. All right? And, you know, you go through all of that stuff. So I've been through that kind of training. I've handled real pistols.

33:07

So I said, I know something about this. You know, I know something about shooting. I know something about, you know, the rules of firearms and the rules of engagement may be different depending on your law enforcement agency. And... What ultimately happened was everybody says, are you trying to justify the shooting?

33:30

And that was the main emotional logic, which harkens back to what I was saying. We are feeling machines. We just happen to think. And so I was like, I could say that's a good shoot or I could say it's a bad shoot, but only people who are shooters understand that kind of language.

33:51

What everybody else wants to say is, can you justify this? And my whole point was she didn't just accidentally have her van there. This was no accident. And I was like, well, A lot of the actions that we see depend on the intent of the person. What are they trying to do?

34:18

And what do they do and what ends up happening after they've done what they've done? And we're not going to know that until the trial is over. If we get, you know, accurate testimonies from the depositions and all that stuff. And unfortunately there will be one witness missing who was unfortunately dead.

34:41

So what in the end I saw were some things that I predicted. and other things that I had no idea after I watched a series of these videos. One thing that I predicted and I'm like, I'm just going to play an attorney. I'm going to say this is mitigating evidence or this is incriminating evidence for

35:07

all parties involved. Right. So is it incriminating for somebody to, you know, curse off an officer? Blah, blah, blah, blah. So I got down into that rabbit hole and. My ultimate conclusion. was two things. Number one, and these are abstract and I'll leave it to people to interpret it.

35:37

As someone who has had martial arts training and pistol shooting and has handled deadly force and non-lethal force as well, my sensei's first rule was you're a warrior. Don't go stupid places where stupid people are doing stupid things. That's rule number one. That's the best. That is the road to peace. Unless you are committed.

36:08

If you're committing yourself to that situation, to a resolution in that situation, your intent is to handle whatever happens. And that goes for everybody who is there. And the second conclusion is shit happens. Shit happens. You can't control everything that you're trying to accomplish. There are unintended consequences for every situation. And we are not perfect.

36:37

And I think everybody who looked more at more than one or five videos, they're like, oh, I didn't know that before. Oh, I knew this before. And people get into this minutia of And I think that that has to wait of the thinking, you know, where you can say, at this millisecond, the tires were pointed this way.

37:03

At that millisecond, the person's hands are on the hood. And it's actually, it's a lot simpler than that. For certain parts of it, they're very simple. For example, as soon as you begin to shoot, the law doesn't make a distinction. Your intent, when you pull the trigger, you are now in a new category of things.

37:27

And if one bullet goes that way and another bullet goes this way and another bullet goes, it's all the same. It's all the same shooting. Your motive at the moment of shooting is what's going on. That's what counts. So people are saying, well, the first bullet didn't hit her, so that was okay.

37:45

But it was the second and the third bullet. that's he should have known between the time he shot the first bullet and the second bullet that he was not going to stop the car or he was just going to injure her or or what that and yeah people get into details that don't matter legally

38:06

right i was gonna say that matter emotionally yeah right and if you're not familiar with the case law You know, and people were saying, well, these people don't, she wasn't a suspect, she's not foreign, so she should be able to do these kinds of things. Abstract law enforcement?

38:25

Well, no, she didn't abstract, because she didn't point the car at him. She was just trying to get away.

38:31

But was the car supposed to be there just as a commercial matter?

38:35

I don't know. Right, right. So there was the three-minute video that showed... Right. like nine ICE officers getting out of various vehicles and standing around and talking to each other and then starting to walk north. I was like, wait, wait. How did she know?

38:54

Wasn't the wife, the commonwealth wife, kind of, shall we say, provocative?

38:59

Yeah, she was. And she was also ex-military. So she said, hey, I'm ex-military, right?

39:08

It sounds like a bad situation all the way around.

39:12

Yeah.

39:12

It sounds like it was not... You can either escalate matters or de-escalate matters. And this was in a situation where there was no, people forgot how to de-escalate. And so things needlessly escalated. Yes, but I mean, all arrests can go wrong. which is why the wise bird does not find themselves, you know,

39:36

amongst the lions and the leopards. The wise bird remains above the prey. So I think that's my point, is that sometimes we make decisions out of passion and emotion, and they're not, to use your own phrasing, it's not the most logical thing to do.

39:55

You have to.

39:55

There's a word for it. Self-regulating. One has to self-regulate themselves when they're in volatile situations. And I think some people do that naturally. Other people just get riled up in the moment.

40:10

Yeah. And it goes to, you know, it goes to a lot of things. And not coincidentally, well, yes, coincidentally, I was thinking about Antifa in Portland several years ago. Oh, okay. And why the U.S. rules of evidence can't say as an aggravating circumstance that you are a member of Antifa. All right. So, yeah, yeah.

40:42

I think it's 403. 403 is the number which says for the rules of federal evidence, you're belonging to a controversial organization. can't be considered an aggravating motive.

41:01

Well, I don't know. I have to confess, I'm not aware of the details of that one either, but that strikes me a little strange.

41:06

Yeah, that one's, yeah.

41:08

That seems suitable for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling at some point down the road. But nonetheless, nonetheless, I appreciate this walkthrough with these burning issues. And now perhaps we will turn our focus to... That's one of your New Year's resolutions to the books. Books, books, and more books, I think.

41:29

Yes. And I think by the end of this, people who have just tuned into this for the first time will recognize how we geek out over details like this all the time.

41:43

This is true. This is so true. I still remember that momentous conversation for me. I think it was in June. of 2025 last year or June 2024. How long have you been doing this, by the way, Michael? When did we start? Was it 2023?

42:00

We've been bi-weekly for about two and a half, three years maybe.

42:07

Wow, time flies, time flies. But I remember we were having a conversation about Black Nanbud and I entered into the conversation taking one position and came out of the conversation as I put it, walking into my blackness, stumbling into my blackness, and I thought that was a very, very good example of the wide-ranging conversations we could have.

42:31

But in any case, let's see whether or not we've reached similar profound moments of insight or not in this conversation. So I referenced earlier, as we were beginning the session, that I read a book, a wonderful book over Christmas, about Howard University President Mordecai Wyatt Johnson, first black president of Howard University.

42:55

And I loved the book so much that it sparked a few essays and so stacked for me. What I loved about this book was for whatever reason, it's hard to find a lot of material in the public square about Mr. Johnson. And I just think that's because in his day and age, in the 1910s, 20s,

43:19

30s and 40s and 50s, people did not recognize that they were living in momentous moments. No one really took the time and probably President Johnson didn't take the time at the time to think I should be recording and writing an autobiography about my life, because I'm someone who might be remembered 50 years later.

43:43

I think he was probably too humbled and too concerned about the events of the time that he was living in. And I think black Americans, perhaps for whatever reason, were not as keen to recording these developments in real time. But having said that, a professor, I think he was formerly of Morgan State College,

44:08

did write an autobiography of President Johnson. And it was just superb because I had a chance to peer into this man and kind of get a sense of who he was, where he came from, who were his people, and what kind of gave him a sense of destiny.

44:29

One of the great things that I did, I wrote an essay called, I Buried a Former Slave Woman. It was on January 3rd.

44:37

Oh, yes, yes.

44:38

Yeah, yeah. And I love that because I was looking through this book and the author had noted this wonderful story. So, Mr. Johnson was just this incredible scholar intellectual. He gave the commencement address at Harvard June 22nd, 1922, only the second black person to do so behind W.B. Du Bois, class of 1890. But... Two years later,

45:06

he found himself as a preacher at this small, modest black church in Charleston, West Virginia, of all places, Charleston, West Virginia. There are only 5,000 blacks in town. And you can just imagine how they must have felt. This is like man out of heaven. How did we secure the services of this incredible mind?

45:31

The congregants were so impressed as he would preach sermon after sermon. They pulled their money and retained a stenographer, a court reporter, to record this man because they were just so wowed by him. And so in the book, the writer shares with us six sermons that the recorder had noted. And they were just, I get chills.

45:52

I'm feeling chills right now. Just imagining this image of this man. humble nondescript everyday people sunday morning in charleston west virginia listening to this man of his generation arguably the best orator of his generation and let me read to you i'm going to read to you ladies and gentlemen uh something

46:16

from this essay now what happened was uh mordecai johnson was the son of a former slave his father was reverend And so that was an important factor in Mordecai's life. And on one occasion, he had a chance to bury a woman. She was 106 years old, and he was a pastor at her burial.

46:49

And she was a former slave. She was 106 years old. And Mordecai in the pulpit thought, you know, this needs to be shared with people, what I felt, the meaning of burial of a slave woman, a former slave woman. And I quote from his sermon. And imagine, ladies and gentlemen, Mordecai Johnson spoke

47:12

with the voice of Southern Negro peoplehood, and that's the word he would have used in the 1920s, you could tell from his booming baritone voice, like his father, Pastor Wyatt Johnson, that he was of a black church, a black school, Morehouse College, that he had not adopted a fancy Harvard accent despite his year to it at Harvard.

47:38

So this is Pastor Mordecai Johnson. The other day, I buried a woman who was 106 years old and who had been a slave practically all her years. When I buried her, I could not keep from looking at her continents in that coffin. And the peace that passes human understanding was on that dead face.

48:12

I stood there, trying to preach, and the thought kept continually forcing itself in my mind. How can this woman whose back has been beaten so many times, who had been abused so many times, how can she lie in this casket so peaceful?

48:37

How could she delve and will and toil and live a hundred years and go down to her grave in peace? The spirit of the Lord said to me, she discovered that the slave can fall in love with his work, the same as a free man.

49:01

He can so love his work and so address himself to the needs of those who abuse him, that the suffering will come off his back as a water off the back of a duck. The spirit of God will come into his soul as the spirit that passes all understanding.

49:23

And one just imagines the impact of those words before these congregants in this small church in Charleston, West Virginia on August 10th, 1924. Because he was speaking. himself as the son of a former slave. And he recognized that even though all could be taken from one because of slave status, nonetheless,

49:50

what one should remember and focus on was the enterprise, the industry of those who had endured that status. And that was just one of the six essays that I found most moving. So I guess my point is, Michael, this book is one of my books that I cherish, that I recall, that I share,

50:12

because I believe Reverend Johnson is one of the greatest unsung heroes. black american history and i hope one day someone who is listening to this podcast will take up the mantle and write a screenplay or a novel about this man the son of slaves who became the master of higher education for his people what do you think

50:38

amazing amazing i have um Tell us the name of that book again.

50:46

Sure.

50:46

Please.

50:46

The name of the book, ladies and gentlemen, is Mordecai, the Man, and His Message. The story of Mordecai Wyatt Johnson by Richard I. McKinney, published in 1977. A lost gem. Wow. Wow. It's...

51:06

I have never been a student of American slavery. Again, I'm a numbers guy. So I was amazed to learn that there had been only since they counted them, which was the founding of the Urban League, to count the people who were lynched post-Reconstruction. 5,000. About 5,000 people were of them counting. Which, and they were not all black.

51:43

Right. Including blacks and whites and others. Italians, for example. Yeah. And I was shocked by that number. I was like, how many times have I gone to a King Day celebration like people will have today and parades and tomorrow? And here, well, we have to dedicate ourselves to the people who died,

52:09

and of course that would include slaves who died, but I would imagine millions of people have died and shed blood in America for the cause of anti-racism and the struggle for civil rights and civil liberties. But it turns out there weren't that many. But it also turns out that the rare genius

52:36

There are people who understand this stuff perfectly. And we kind of pretend that, oh, it's whatever today's year is. And now we understand better than anybody possibly ever understood before. Right. Because if they understood it the way that we understand it, they would have never have stood for it. Let me have been a slave.

52:57

I would have taught Mass or something like that. Right? Right. And, you know, you get that people look at the Wakanda films, the Black Panther or Django Unchained. I haven't seen Seven Years a Slave, so I can't comment on that one, although that's one of my favorite actors.

53:15

But I think we get an idea that nobody really knew what was going on and that there was a very stark blindness. that now is attributed to all of ancient America. Ancient America was so wrong and all of them were wrong and nobody knew what was going on.

53:35

And yet there were people who understood it and actually transcended it and figured things out and just said, hey, look, we're just human beings and we go through hard times. And these are the hard times that we have to get through. And these are the hard times that we're gonna get our children through So when people,

53:57

you know, today, where Amazon will deliver anything you want to your doorstep, how can I bring a child up in this world? You know, where police shoot black men all the time in the street. And I'm like, you know, there are no church bombings in America today. And if there are, you'll hear about it.

54:23

And everybody will be against it. And so we paint each other, again, feeling people rather than thinking people. Like there's no way around this and everything is doomed. And again, that I think is a function of how we get our information and how cheesy that information is.

54:45

And if I might, I'm going to move now to the second book, number two.

54:50

Wait, wait, I want to do a book. I want to do a book. Wait, wait, wait. Let me do a book. All right, go ahead.

54:55

Ladies and gentlemen, Michael is so impressive. I just bow to him in terms of his books. So I'm going to ask his indulgence. Let me get my little two books out of the way. No, go ahead. Please do, sir. Because he has great books.

55:08

The second one is, and I just finished this two days ago, Don't Misread Me.

55:16

Don't misread me.

55:17

Well, that was the name of my subject essay for the book. The book title itself is Unveiled, How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam by Yasmin Muhammad. And so why did I title my book review preliminary of that book, Don't Misread Me, is because it goes to many of the things Michael and I share as we support free

55:45

black thought, independence of thought, human dignity, creative expression, and the individual. Yasmin Mohammed, the author, was born into a Muslim family. She would live her childhood in Canada and Egypt. she would suffer incredible cruelty at the hands of her mother in the name of

56:13

religious dogma and the names of radical islam so for example there are accounts of the mother summoning a man she was sleeping with to beat her six-year-old daughter Yasmin because Yasmin had forgotten to memorize certain phrases or passages from the Quran so when the man had finished beating the six-year-old daughter did her mother comfort her no

56:46

Her mother left the room and proceeded to flirt with the man while her daughter suffered under the bed. Wow. And the book kind of goes in that vein. It was, Michael, one of the most difficult books I've read in my life. The only books I can think of that are comparable would be American Slavery As It

57:08

Is by Theodore Weld and My Little Life by a prominent... Asian American novelist, but American slavery as it is was written in 1839 so I could put some distance between the horrors in that book and today. My Little Life, although it involves lots of accounts of sexual abuse and depression,

57:34

is a novel it's fiction this book was real and that's what was so disturbing and yet i think it's important for readers to read this book because it reminds us that when there's no internal check on dogma or religious dogma the victims can be innocent little children with nowhere to flee nowhere to run and when jasmine

58:02

as a young, I think 13-year-old, sought help from her teacher in school in Canada, sought help from the Canadian court system. They washed her hands of Jasmine and said, this is cultural freedom. We can't get involved. And so such a dreadful story of lower expectations for people because of dogma, because of culture. In other words, child abuse,

58:30

hit behind the shield of radical dogma, radical Islam. So that's my second book. What do you think?

58:41

Wow. It reminds me of two books when I hear that. And of course, the career of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who understands that stuff very well. And yeah, it's... One of the things I've been thinking about recently is when you talk about rights and responsibilities and how people see the world,

59:14

there are a lot of people who grow up in the United States in relative comfort. And so you can say, well, I would never, you know, nobody deserves to die. And nobody deserves to die is a statement of innocence. Because if you got out into the world and you saw the evil that's in the world,

59:42

then that would change very quickly. I always think of this in terms of... let's say football, there's a point at which football ceases to be entertaining. And that is when by accident or on purpose, there's a flagrant injury, right? And people say, well, you know, they're getting their heads bashed, you know,

1:00:12

and they can do that for 13 years. But if you know what happened to Joe Theismann, then you would say, oh, well, that's a different class of things. And if it was very well recorded, go check it out on YouTube. And basically his leg was broken at an angle where you just wince and you can't

1:00:36

bear to watch it. And every human being has that understanding of violence. If you see somebody freshly dead for the first time in your life or something like that, you're just, oh, oh, that's evil. Or that's horrific. And we sit and enjoy our melodrama without really facing evil.

1:01:08

And so there are people who know very well that there are people who deserve to die. And if you had any, let's say, officers who work in jails and prisons in your family, they might not even tell you those stories. But you know that they know that there are people who deserve to die.

1:01:31

And there is evil in this world. And you can't just say, well, it's all relative. Because it's not.

1:01:41

It's not. It's not. I mean, one of the things that's so much shocking in the book, one shocking stat, 99.3% of all women in Egypt have been sexually assaulted. Think about that. Think about that. That's just, I don't know.

1:02:00

That's hideous.

1:02:00

And if you try to leave radical Islam, according to the author, one is subjected to Honor violence, honor killings. In fact, Jasmine's mother, in 2004, when she was an adult, Jasmine gained up the courage to remove her. Is it pronounced Habib? It's H-I-J-A-B.

1:02:24

Yes. Yes. I can't even think of it now because my mind is going to. But you know what I'm talking about, the head covering.

1:02:32

Yes, yes, yes, yes. So for the first time in her life, she summoned up the courage, to face her mother without wearing that head covering. And what did her mother say? I will kill you. You will die. And from that point on, she has never seen her mother again. Just think about that.

1:02:54

That is just the power of dogma to so corrupt and destroy the otherwise natural relationship between a mother and a daughter. It's terrifying.

1:03:06

Yeah, I... I'm coming to understand this a different way. It's still horrible no matter what or what the genesis is. And interestingly enough, it's coming from a video game that's putting me into a situation. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I won't talk about the video game.

1:03:29

I'll just say it has to do with a character named Jack in a video game called Mass Effect 2. So Mass Effect 2 has this story where you get to see someone who was abused as a child and how the effects of that manifest themselves later in life.

1:03:52

she comes she becomes a very dangerous person and jack is a female but yeah this happens to us it happens to people and i think in various degrees we all understand and sympathize and that sympathy is it can be weaponized if you take someone who's innocent who you know just like um

1:04:18

would sit and honk their horn in the middle of an intersection taunting police officers, they'd never know how bad it can go. But they think they are fighting in solidarity with people who are abused. And this is one of the insights of The Coddling of America,

1:04:35

where Jonathan Haidt wrote that and said a lot of undergraduate students say, well, they will fight on behalf of black men, unarmed black men, because they're being shot by the thousands every year in America, right?

1:04:50

The thousands, that's right.

1:04:51

So why shouldn't we disobey? Why shouldn't we disturb our own cafes and sidewalks and lecture halls? And why shouldn't we call out those Jews over there? Because we're all guilty for not being our own Greta Thunbergs. And these people really have no idea. of how dark and ugly humanity gets.

1:05:20

And you can maintain this sense of outrage and be an activist on behalf in solidarity with these people that you think you know. And you're just too soft for that work. And you don't even read any books like some of the books that changed my mind about what the world is and what people are capable of.

1:05:47

Right.

1:05:48

So I would have to say one book that did that, as soon as you started talking about it, was Jonah Goldberg wrote a book called Liberal Fascism. Okay. Tell us about it. Liberal fascism... I don't know what Jonah Goldberg's up to these days. I don't know if he's fallen out of favor with the Republican Party.

1:06:10

Does he do the dispatch or not?

1:06:12

I don't know. I don't know where he is. I don't know where he is. But he was originally on the right, and I'm pretty sure he's still on the right. But MAGA has transmogrified everything. And he basically went through and said, hey, look, the Nazis were socialists.

1:06:32

These are the rules, these are the planks of the National Socialist Party. And one of the things they want to do is nationalize the stores. Of course, they wanted to get rid of Jews. Of course, they wanted a national ID for the purpose of getting rid of Slavs and Jews from the German population. But they were saying,

1:06:54

you know, everything is going to be for our industry, for our greater good. And it was going to be one of the first things that I wrote this year. Um, but, uh, I was overtaken by other events. Right. Yeah. And, but they had like a 25 planks on this, um, this, this, uh, the National Socialist Party.

1:07:21

And I think I'll just repeat a few of them because we've talked about...

1:07:26

And listeners should know there's a clear distinction, if I remember correctly, in Germany during this time period, 2030s and 40s, between socialist and communist. There's a very clear distinction.

1:07:40

Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. So let's see. Here's one. We demand that all unearned income, all income that does not arise from work, be abolished. Okay. All right, there's one. We demand the nationalization of all trusts.

1:08:06

oh my god, this sounds like a nightmare for Shelby Chastisi, ladies and gentlemen, it's Chastisi. Because we do know some people who just kind of exist beyond the normal economic concerns of people.

1:08:23

We demand that ruthless war be waged against those who work to the injury of the common welfare. Traitors, usurers, profiteers are to be punished with death, regardless of creed or race.

1:08:37

Oh, my God. That's okay.

1:08:40

We demand that Roman law, which serves the materialist ordering of the world, be replaced by German common law.

1:08:52

And notice it's not we suggest or we think or we propose, we demand. I love that kind of authoritarian mandatory force plus compliance kind of language, right?

1:09:05

And here's one, the last one I'll say.

1:09:07

Yeah.

1:09:08

in order to make it possible for every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education, and thus the opportunity to reach positions of leadership, the state must assume the responsibility of organizing thoroughly the entire cultural system of the people. The curricula of all educational establishments shall be adapted to practical life.

1:09:33

The conception of the state idea must be taught in the schools from the very beginning. We demand that specially talented children of poor parents, whatever their station or occupation, be educated at the expense of the state.

1:09:49

This sounds a little bit like liberated ethnic studies, right? You're focusing on the little kids, right? Insisting that they be taught a certain way. Ah, it's horrible, they're parallels, they're parallels.

1:10:02

uh yeah there's there's there's there's 25 of these uh these demands which is which is core to the nazi philosophy right and people don't really appreciate that that's

1:10:14

not always trumpeted in public square right right right so it's a it's a it's a

1:10:21

it's a very interesting thing and i think i i learned that from jonah goldberg's book liberal fascism in the early 2000s gotcha um so that that was that and of course martin amos wrote a book coba the dread which was a biography of joseph stalin which changed my whole idea about the world oh really

1:10:45

prior to reading that i thought Well, conservative anti-communism is just, you know, that's just their excuse. Everybody's an armchair cold warrior. There's nothing so bad about communism. Yeah. And I just had no idea. Graphically explaining other than just, you know, Pol Pot is the greatest mass murderer. No, no, it was Mao Zedong. No, it was Stalin.

1:11:13

No, it was Genghis Khan. No, it was Hadrian. And it's all this abstract... when but then you think about what it takes to have 20 000 people per week die of starvation yes where where where farms have been collectivized and the state says all of these bushels is going to go to we're going to sell it

1:11:40

to another country instead of to us because we can get the money that we want for it. And that's very similar to what was done with Venezuelan oil. The revenues for that were not going to the people. They were selling it to other states, which were collaborators in that... usurpation of the people's wealth. Interesting.

1:12:10

My final book, that is number three, then you can take it away, Michael, your additional books. My final book is one I discovered when I was in Richmond back in November. I was looking for a good biography of Philip Roth, the writer, because I always wanted to read about him, but I couldn't find it.

1:12:29

It wasn't in stock. But I came across this book, and I was intrigued by the title and the picture and the image. The title is Mother Mary Comes to Me by Arnati Roy. And I'll show you the picture of this woman. Do you see her? Yes, yes. I was intrigued by her.

1:12:50

Arnati Roy.

1:12:51

Yeah. And I actually gave the book as a gift to my daughter, and my daughter's beginning to read it. And I was so intrigued that I finished the book before she... But one of the things, two things about the book. Number one, I'll put her book up again here for Michael. When I knew what she was,

1:13:12

her ethnic group, when my daughter saw her, my daughter said to me, oh, she's colored from South Africa. No, she's a Syrian Christian from India. But it's interesting how the mind works, how we can perceive people in a way, and they're totally something else. kind of the idea of don't misread me.

1:13:32

But the point is, number two, this book so, what's the word I'm looking for? It's so... grabbed my attention it so captivated me and I wasn't expecting that because I'm not Syrian I am Christian but I've never lived in India I'm not a woman I don't

1:13:52

smoke cigarettes as she gracefully does on the cover here why would I find this book so fascinating and I think it's because as a writer this woman does a wonderful job of into the most intimate relationship one can imagine, and it's between a mother and a daughter. And she writes about the fact that her mother,

1:14:20

this wonderful founding father of a Christian school in India, her mother, who was a wonderful female activist for the rights of Syrian Christians in India, a great humanitarian. Her mother, who was loved by countless people in the town and throughout India, was a monster of a mother.

1:14:48

That her mother was so cruel that her mother killed her dog when she was a little kid to teach her a lesson. That her mother hated her father that her mother would just belittle her. And then her mother would play the victim, because her mother had severe asthma attacks, severe asthma.

1:15:13

And so because the writer loved her mother and hated her mother, but she loved her mother, she found herself in this exquisite dilemma of being at odds with her feelings and emotions. So when her mother had asthma attacks, It was like she was about to die and the writer would want to breathe for her mother.

1:15:34

And this is the same woman who would kill her dog a few weeks later. And so I love that. And at the end of the book, she says, I left home at the age of 18 and I had to leave home in order to love my mother.

1:15:54

that my mother, a wonderful woman in the Syrian Christian community, was a cruel mother to me. And I just love how she peers into those exquisite dilemmas in the human condition. It's just wonderful because you want to love your mother, but you need to hate your mother for what she's done to you.

1:16:19

The larger world reveres and loves your mother, but they don't see inside the house. I love this book. It's called Mother Mary Comes to Me by Arunhadi Roy.

1:16:31

Arendadi, I think it's, I'm pretty sure it's Arendadi. And I've heard of her before, but I did not know that she's our age. Yes. I mean, born in the same year. Yeah. Um, I know she had a book called The God of Small Things.

1:16:48

Yes, yes.

1:16:50

And I just never bothered to read Roy. So, yeah, that's crazy.

1:16:56

This is, I mean, if you have, like, on a vacation, like, I don't know. July 4th or Thanksgiving if you just have like a spare three to four days it's worth a read at least for me it was like I say captivating because on the surface I

1:17:14

have little points of interface with this woman but the more I read the more and more and more I saw crisis of existence for her as a little kid. Because little kids, you come into the world, you don't choose your dad, you don't choose your mom,

1:17:34

you don't choose your...

1:17:35

You have to kind of accommodate yourself to the big adults in your life. And she frames that dilemma beautifully, how you can have a revered mother and a cruel mother, how you can love your mother and yet can't wait to leave your mother at the age of 18.

1:17:54

Right. Wow. That's nuts. That's nuts. I'm going to, you know, I may get to... around to that she's an interesting person, no doubt.

1:18:09

Right, right, right. No doubt. And I love the fact, because I love ambiguous people, I love the idea that my daughter totally misread her. I think there's something divine about people who are racially ambiguous. And I've heard about this before, because I think it's one thing for you to be able just to say, oh,

1:18:29

you're this or you're that, and not give the person a second thought. But when someone is really at kind of the edge of ambiguity between different groups and you just can't tell or you misread them, in a way that's a beautiful thing because it pulls you in.

1:18:45

You're forced now to ask yourself, well, who really is that person? Where are they really from? How did they come to be how they are in the world? And I just love those... I just love those souls who force us to look beyond the surface of parents. I just think they're beautiful people. I just really do.

1:19:09

I think that was easier for me as a young person because there were so many seismic shifts in the way our family looked at the world. Right, right. And there was always a gap to be overcome by your commitment to family. And having my father from New England and my mother from the South,

1:19:39

that was gonna be a different kind of thing. And then all of us children were raised in California. And so none of us went to church until I was like nine or 10 years old. And we were definitely in the movement, the black consciousness movement, early on. And so I think with my family, I had an understanding

1:20:11

that we were moving through the different times. And there was always love, but it wasn't affectionate, demonstrative love. It was respect for who you are and who you're going to become and what your ability to face challenges in the future. So the first book that I read as a kid

1:20:39

that let me understand oh there's other people out there like me was a novel called stop time by frank conroy and honestly i don't remember a thing about it it's just that it rang true it rang true it rang true to like yeah this is a kid like me and

1:21:01

he sees the same kind of things i see right uh which includes you know The falsity of adulthood. Yes. Kids are always saying, oh, you're getting so, adults are always saying, you're getting so big and you're going to grow up to be something, you know. Yeah, yeah.

1:21:22

But it's very rare that your dad's best friend that you've always called uncle, but he's not an uncle, he says, let me tell you something, your dad's full of it. And you don't you don't know what adults say to each other, you know, in their unguarded moments. That's a good point. And so, you know,

1:21:49

they're always and the more successful your parents are, the harder it is to get behind them. Until you get to the point where you just have to rebel. You're just like, maybe something's wrong with me, but I just can't be like my dad. And everybody loves my dad. Everybody thinks my mom is great.

1:22:10

And they just don't know, right?

1:22:13

Other than Adam B. Coleman's book about his dad, fatherhood, very searing and poignant. Can you think of any other prominent books... in black American literature that are as penetrating in the parent-child relationship as Mother Mary Comes to Me by Roy. Do we have anything comparable to that?

1:22:38

I would suggest, If Beale Street could talk, I think Beale Street is that. Okay. Because you get the feeling that these young lovers are against the world.

1:22:52

Mm-hmm.

1:22:53

And they're trying to create something out of the love for each other, which is still mysterious to them. Mm-hmm. And then they just have to take that risk.

1:23:03

Mm-hmm.

1:23:04

that they will defy their parents, they'll defy expectations. And it's doubly significant when you learn that Baldwin was homosexual. And he must have felt that very, very severely in his growing up. So that's one that makes me think of it. The others that I think of, I mean, because it was part of my own rebellion,

1:23:41

which was reading Steinbeck. John Steinbeck's books, Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat. And he also wrote The Grapes of Wrath. Yes. Which I loved as a movie, but... After reading Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row, I was in the seventh grade. I was like, I am so sick of these depressing stories. Why do you think that I,

1:24:05

as a black person, have to read this about poor, depressed people who can't do anything in their lives? And I was like, I am not going to read another damn thing that you guys send me. And next on the list was, and I'm in Catholic school, The Cross and the Switchblade. And I'm like, no. No. I refuse.

1:24:27

So I read one which turned out to be pretty good by Robert Lipsight called The Contender. But it was another inner city young black man becomes a boxer and he's not sure of himself and he has to fight and at some point he wins and maybe his coach is on the take or something like that.

1:24:52

I don't remember the details but I was like okay I can deal with this. But I do specifically remember being 12 or 13 years old and saying, I'm not going to read any more children's books. I'm going to read the adult books. And so I had read Arthur C. Clark's 2001. Yes.

1:25:19

That was my first adult book that I read while it was new. So I think when it first came out in paperback, I got that. And, you know, like all scientific-oriented kids, I read the Yellow Pages. I had those books where they have stickers in the back, and you take the stickers, and they're like,

1:25:43

this is the lunar module, this is the command module, this is the Saturn V rocket engines, and I had books about missiles and rockets and cars and trucks and electric circuits, and I had a chemistry set, I built a crystal radio. I did all that kind of stuff. There was a company...

1:26:03

out of New Jersey called Edmund Scientific. And Edmund Scientific sold all these gadgets and stuff like that. So I was definitely one of those kids that did the scientific kind of stuff.

1:26:17

Did you launch rockets in your backyard?

1:26:19

I didn't do that. That was expensive. I did that. That was something only rich kids could do.

1:26:24

I did that. I used to launch rockets all the time.

1:26:27

Estes rockets.

1:26:29

Yes, yes, yes. It was fun.

1:26:30

Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Well, I did. So I was definitely a science fiction kid. So I started off with Danny Dunn. And Hardy Boys Mysteries. Yeah. And my brother read all Hardy Boys. And he run Nancy Drew. I was like, how can you read Nancy Drew? Ew. But we definitely did that kind of stuff. Right.

1:26:59

And we would have all been Boy Scouts if there was a Boy Scout troop. As it was, we did all kinds of carpentry and home labor, electrician stuff. Right. We did a lot of hiking and camping and that kind of stuff. I'm kind of surprised that none of us ended up being soldiers.

1:27:21

When I look back at the values of my life, I think, oh, you know what? I probably should have become a military officer. At the very least, an intelligence officer. Someone very analytic, someone... Well, maybe you were born in the wrong generation, like, Yeah, and my father did not like, my father's a very peaceful guy.

1:27:52

He was a warrior poet without the warrior part. He was a warrior in the home because we are absolutely all about discipline, which you have to be when you have five kids. Otherwise it would be chaos, especially with kids like what we were. But he was also very intellectual. Yes. A big reader.

1:28:17

Do you remember the first novel you ever read?

1:28:21

The first novel, it was probably Jaws. Jaws. That's 1970s, right? By Peter Benchley. Yeah. I mean, if you don't, you know, count the kid stuff like I was just saying. Right, right, right. Like there was three or four books that I loved. Call It Courage was one. The Lemonade Trick was another one. Okay. And The Secret Language.

1:28:53

Wow, these are good books. I remember the first novel I ever read, and I remember it so distinctly for the simple reason. I was a nonfiction kind of guy. I just loved reading history, learning facts, reading life stories. So it was very unusual for me to read something that wasn't true, that was just made up.

1:29:13

But I remember, I think it was seventh grade, maybe seventh grade. The class had us, the teacher had us read a novel, and it was Watership Down. You remember that?

1:29:22

Oh, wow. Yeah. I just saw the movie last year. Oh, did you? What did you think? For the first time. I was like, all children should see this.

1:29:33

Yeah.

1:29:34

Because it's a cruel world. And you don't know how cruel it is until you see animals doing this.

1:29:43

Right, right, exactly. And so I enjoyed reading it. I had to give a report on the book. I acted out the characters. And I remember after that book report, the teacher came to me and said, have you ever thought about becoming a writer? No one had ever said it to me before.

1:30:01

And I just kind of put her away, get out of here. Writers don't make any money. But it's funny how I probably, if I had gone down that path in an earlier life, I wonder where I would have been today. I don't know. It's interesting. Because writers don't.

1:30:23

Most writers, it's like a second job or a third job. They do it on the side.

1:30:28

Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I have no idea how much money journalists make. Mm-hmm. I can imagine with my appetite for reading and my appetite for facts that I would be an investigative journalist. But I've never been interested in crime. So that whole crime blotter thing, I would love to know it.

1:30:54

I would love to work a city desk. for a major newspaper, and just knowing all the fires and all the crimes and all the accidents and all that stuff, that would be fascinating stuff.

1:31:05

And that would give you great material to write books, right? Because you would have all these real-life stories. It would.

1:31:11

Yeah. I did... I never read any of that until maybe about... Maybe a decade ago. And I started reading John Sanford. And he did, he has a couple characters, one of them named Virgil Flowers. And the other guy, I don't actually, his main character, I can't remember his name.

1:31:34

But I really love reading those because ultimately the good guy won. Right. And it was also very Midwestern. So it had this flavor of the Midwest that was very different. And there was a great one that he had with a Russian woman who comes to the United States. And she says, you Americans, you have signs everywhere.

1:31:59

What do you do not know where you are? It's like, you're so stupid. You don't know where you are unless there's street signs on every corner. And it was very interesting. And then I read another guy who wrote noir fiction, police fiction, for Los Angeles. And the show Bosch was based on his.

1:32:27

So I read all the Bosch stories, and those were good.

1:32:31

And for those readers who wonder, did I progress beyond Watership Down in the seventh grade... I did over time. I haven't read a few more novels. For example, Martin Eaton by Jack London. It's a wonderful story of a poor kid in Oakland who decides he's going to become a writer, come to hell with high water,

1:32:54

and he does it. And I love it. I love that triumph over adversity framing. That just does it for me. Martin Eaton by Jack London. Wow. And then there's another one, The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. I love that book. For those who don't know, Faulkner is a famous Southern writer from Mississippi.

1:33:14

And in The Sound and the Fury, he writes this tragic story of a family. I think it's the Compson family. It's a Southern aristocratic family. I think the great grandfather had been governor of Mississippi. But over the generations, the family falls from its perch. It loses its luster. And I love how Faulkner...

1:33:36

recreates the world of a family that knew better days in its past and how that plays out into pressure. It reminds me of my dad's family because you can argue that The greatest times of triumph over adversity were in the 1870s when a former slave manages to use his money to buy a mansion for his children.

1:34:05

That's a great story of the American dream. But over time, the family disperses and the church grows older. And by the time you've got third cousins and fourth cousins, People become strangers to one another. There's no longer a sense of tight ethos. And so I found Echoes of the Sound and the Fury,

1:34:29

because it's a Southern book about a Southern family, kind of in my family, which is why I kind of liked it. I read Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Good Lord, a long book. I think it's like, what, 300 footnotes or something to a novel. I read it. Don't ask me questions.

1:34:49

I couldn't tell you what it was about other than drugs and sex, Canada and terrorists. I think I'm just not worthy of the novel, Infinite Jest. I'll be honest, ladies and gentlemen, I like my meat and potatoes. Give me a simple tale like Martin Eaton by Jack London. But when you get into... Oh, deep, deep, deep.

1:35:16

David Foster Wallace has sentences that are literally five to nine lines long. I'm just not that smart to follow a five to nine line sentence. I get lost.

1:35:30

I have trouble breaking my sentences up into short declarative ones. Because I do all these subjunctive subordinate clauses, you know, that moves backwards and forwards in time.

1:35:45

I remember I was reading it for just one day, trying to read it. And I told my wife, hey, come here, come here, come here. I'm going to read this sentence to you. She said, OK. Literally, I started reading. She fixes some coffee. She's cooking something. I'm still reading.

1:36:05

five minutes past i'm still reading this such as i think wow and i just i just thought you know how how is this effective communication of the story now grant you once again i just may be a meat and potatoes guy i just may like my My sentence is short and sweet and to the point,

1:36:28

which is why I admire you, Michael, because I think you are a connoisseur of the long and informed sentence.

1:36:38

I do. And that's good. It's interesting when you mention Jack London and asking me what novels I read. And for some reason I blanked out, but then I have this associative thing. Oh, Jack London. I remember Call of the Wild and White Fang. I read both of those books.

1:36:55

Right, right, right.

1:36:55

And then it was like people would tell me, yeah, well, you know, he's racist. And I'm like, I can read all of these books and I'll make up my own mind. And it was also a kind of a slap in the face understanding when black folks that I

1:37:19

would know would talk about black authors as if nobody read them but black people. Uh-huh. He said, well, you know what James Baldwin said, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, well, everybody knows that. Everybody reads James Baldwin. It's like everybody's protest novel. You know, we all know it. And so, you know, the literatures are out there,

1:37:41

and you just kind of wonder, has anybody else read this stuff? Has anybody else experienced this thing? Well, see, I think... And I just wanted to say... Everybody read To Kill a Mockingbird. Yes. You can't get through an education without that being a touchstone of your morality. Right.

1:38:02

And I can remember asking my mother, Mom, what's a whore? Hey, what did your mother say? She did not answer that question. Because it was like an insult. I knew it was an insult. Your mother's a whore lady. And I was like, wow, I don't know that word.

1:38:27

You had a very good relationship with your mom that you would ask her that question. That's very good, I think.

1:38:32

It was a perfectly innocent question because I had no idea what it was. And when she didn't answer, and also Molestead. She was found Molestead. And I don't know what book this was. And she said, spell it. I said, M-O-L-E-S-T-E-D.

1:38:55

Oh. Delight reaction, ladies and gentlemen.

1:39:03

And so she didn't answer that question either. I said she didn't know that word, but maybe she did. She just didn't want to tell me.

1:39:11

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:39:12

So that was very interesting.

1:39:15

Here's my comparable innocence story as well. I remember, and I must have been in elementary school. That sounds right, elementary school. And I read a lot. I heard the word, so I didn't read it, I heard the word. R-A-P-E. But for some reason, my mind read it as R-A-K-E.

1:39:42

And so I felt it was the weirdest thing when people would mention rakes. Someone raked someone leaves. So for many years of my life, I thought, It meant you're raking something, if that makes sense. So, yeah, who knows?

1:39:59

Yeah, there's a funny joke in a Jeopardy answer. Oh, what is a common garden tool which also applies to a person? And everybody answered, ho.

1:40:16

Okay, okay, okay.

1:40:17

The correct answer was rake.

1:40:20

Oh, there you go.

1:40:23

But I also, it's interesting that David Foster Wallace was also profoundly affected by Frank Conroy's book, Stop Time. Oh, okay. So it's the same book that had a deep effect on myself. Interesting. And I guess of David Foster Wallace.

1:40:43

Do you feel simpatico with David Foster Wallace?

1:40:45

I haven't read Infinite Jest. So I guess I have to read that. Did he also do like a monumental work of something like that? That was the title of it? A Monumental Work of Global Significance or something like that?

1:40:59

I don't recall, don't remember. I am not a David Foster Wallace expert. But it was on my bucket list. I wanted to read it because I had heard it was like one of the greatest novels of the century. So I just wanted to say I've done it. And I did it. Yeah.

1:41:16

Yeah.

1:41:16

Couldn't tell you too much about it.

1:41:17

Yeah, I think I will read something like that. I don't know. Maybe. Have you read Word Piece? No. No.

1:41:23

I have. That was on my bucket list, and I read it. And it's... You know, the thing is, the problem with War and Peace is it's been so widely acclaimed over the decades that you come into it expecting it to be biblical, to be wild. I mean, it's great, but I kind of wish that, as a reader,

1:41:45

I could have come into the book without that kind of public marketing, that public acclaim. It's well done. It's a beautiful recreation of russia and napoleon and war over different families and different generations so i think what makes it really great is someone once said it's as it is as if life

1:42:10

could speak so you read war and peace in a sense you're looking at life itself so

1:42:17

that's that's good yeah i found that true um just a final thing about uh reading young I like Kate Chopin and Flannery O'Connor. Flannery O'Connor.

1:42:31

Tell me about her, because I've heard of her, but I don't know much about her.

1:42:33

She's a Southern Christian woman. Mm-hmm. who just writes really precise kinds of stuff. There was something about her. Kate Chopin wrote The Storm, which was a great story. And I took short story in high school for my elective English class.

1:42:50

So I read a lot of that, Bride Comes to Yellow Sky, Red Badge of Courage, all these short books. But I also liked Roots. Roots by Alex Haley was a stupendous thing to read as a teenager.

1:43:09

Did it work for you because you felt it was real, or did it work for you because you were wowed with the power of the fictional world he created?

1:43:21

It was because I was reading a big book that wasn't another Star Trek novel.

1:43:27

Okay, that works, that works, that works.

1:43:29

So... It rang true, but I didn't have, I don't know, I read it before the miniseries came out. And it was a big deal when the miniseries came out. But, yeah, it was good. It was a great big book. It was the big book that I read in high school. Yeah,

1:43:57

and that was its appeal because I had gone through Heinlein and Clark and Bradbury, and I never read Asimov. So I was expecting to read more science fiction than I did, and I think after I read five or six, you know, the whole Star Trek library, I was just like, okay, I'm kind of done with this.

1:44:24

Is there anything more interesting? And then Star Wars the movie came out, and that took over my imagination. But, yeah, novels were not a thing. I mean, after Steinbeck, It's just how can an adult say to you as a young person, this is what you should read.

1:44:50

And I should have read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. That would have been a great book for me to read as a young person. And so I just started picking up books and reading them because after I finished my computer science study, I was like, what are all these liberal arts people thinking?

1:45:10

And I did that first with movies. So I looked at Warren Beatty's movie Reds.

1:45:18

Oh, I love that movie.

1:45:19

And I thought that was very romantic of the writers. Yeah. And I read Eugene O'Neill's stuff in college. Did you ever read The Great Gatsby? I finally read The Great Gatsby. I tell you this. When I start to read the great books, especially of American authors... I find them kind of overrated.

1:45:45

Yes, that was my War and Peace reaction a little bit. The acclaim sucks it out of you.

1:45:52

Yeah, it does. And I read finally something called The White City. And this was also supposed to be a great book. And I just found that they over-explain. It's like for people who have a month... to sit down with a book and read 20 pages every day or something like that.

1:46:16

You want it to go at this slow pace. And that just didn't work for me. And it wasn't until I read Nabokov that some brilliant language came through. Is that Lolita? Lolita.

1:46:31

Okay.

1:46:32

So I read Lolita and another one about a silly professor. I forget the name of it. I think I read three. Did you ever read Dr. Chivago? I watched the movie. I watched the film, finally. And I love the film.

1:46:50

Oh, it's great. It's great.

1:46:51

That's a great film.

1:46:52

I've always thought in my mind, my intuition, that I wish there was an American writer who could write something comparable in the context of America and the black frame. For example, perhaps some black doctor who's really a poet at night.

1:47:17

Right, right.

1:47:18

And he's married to a wonderful old money person.

1:47:20

Well, you know who that is?

1:47:21

That's Toni Morrison. That's Toni Morrison. Is it really? She's done that Dr. Boris?

1:47:26

But it was beloved.

1:47:29

No, that's more, but that's more... But I know, it's not contemporary.

1:47:33

Yeah, right, right, right. And it's very what it is.

1:47:38

Yeah, right.

1:47:40

But in terms of her writing, in terms of her stringing the language together, it was an order of magnitude more brilliant than anything I had read previous to that.

1:47:51

I agree, and let me push back, not even push back. My point is, Beloved... soars at what it does.

1:48:02

Yes, yes, yes.

1:48:04

I'm thinking, however, of something more akin to the, to use a cliche, the great American novel. Something which really looks at unique individual Black American figures and non-Black people And you set their lives and their interaction against the backdrop of a great spiritual war. Not the Russian Revolution, but the woke revolution. And how... See my point?

1:48:39

See my point? That's what I'm thinking about. The great American novel set today in terms of how individual people... acting as humans, are interacting against the backdrop of this great spiritual revolution. That's what I mean. Love is not really like that, although it does well what it does, if that makes sense. When I think of... Yeah. Yeah.

1:49:02

There's... See my point?

1:49:04

I think Tom Wolfe writes like that. Yes. And I loved... I loved A Man in Full. Okay. I think that's the only book that I read by him. Mm-hmm. I read the Babbitt stuff. Yes. And that was okay.

1:49:26

Do you agree with me that we need the great American novel?

1:49:32

It would be great. It would be great. I mean, I started a story like that, but... And it was in the context of America, but it was very Los Angeles. I wrote a book about two best friends. I wrote a book about two best friends. Yeah.

1:49:51

One of them who went away to college, and one of them stayed in the hood. Mm-hmm. And one was, you know, middle class, upper middle class, nice family and well educated. And the other one was on the edge of the ghetto. And he was the brilliant, funny one with the good looks.

1:50:15

And the other one was a little more reserved and strategic-minded. But they were best friends. And I put them into a context of a growing gang presence in Los Angeles.

1:50:32

So that's kind of the backdrop, the growing gang presence.

1:50:34

Right, right. And so basically, this was going to illustrate class differences between blacks. And the forces that would try to get black folks together and the forces that split them apart. And it took the form of a gigantic outsized figure who was the inheritor of a trust.

1:51:01

And he ran a real estate thing, which was similar to what I noticed during the 90s, when young black folks were doing A.L. Williams and they were selling multi-level marketing things. Yes. And it was going through everywhere. Everybody was like, oh, we're going to make money like this.

1:51:23

And so this was a kind of a real estate thing where this guy becomes a real estate magnet and he's flipping houses and he does all that. And then there's another... gang angle on it so i was basically trying to do this game of thrones in the black

1:51:39

community right kind of thing because everybody's chasing power yes and and they go at it by different ways and the story ends up being a tragedy yes it ends up being a tragedy which is fine yeah you know um um the the the the kid from the hood dies

1:51:57

and and uh you know from a variety of circumstances but it had you know radical muslim vegetarians and And it had gangbangers. It had a young girl, teenage pregnancy. It had a woman who found an ancient African manuscript. Yeah. And she ran a library. And it was just this whole big thing.

1:52:24

So let me ask you a question, fellow writer that you are. Yeah. What led to the silent demise of this novel idea?

1:52:36

The L.A. riots. The L.A. riots.

1:52:39

Okay.

1:52:40

The L.A. riots killed more people than my book did. So I couldn't, I mean, I had a freeway sniper, basically. A freeway sniper who was disrupting the traffic between downtown L.A. and the port of Los Angeles. And so that part of L.A. was the no-go zone. Uh, and all it took was, you know, a few pot shots.

1:53:05

Uh, and, and, and one of the gang bosses wanted to control that area. Uh, and, and, but the, the reality of Rodney King just kind of threw that whole thing. I was like, oh, I can't kill enough people in this book for it to be more interesting than reality.

1:53:22

Um, so it, it, it, it still had a poignant tragedy in it. Yeah. Um, But it came down to trust between two friends and both of them having their ambitions to conquer the black community and lead the black community. And they just, you know, it was that kind of thing.

1:53:48

This is a war for the soul of the black community of Los Angeles. And that's the framing. You know, when I retire, I'll probably write the whole thing.

1:53:59

That's the whole point of retirement, right? You spend your time doing what you really want to do. I was watching a podcast last night about what should life be like after retirement, after 64. And it said those who are happiest are not those who sit around watching TV, like watching the Netflix shows over and over again.

1:54:19

or watching Star Trek marathon episodes, those are not the happiest people. The happiest people are the people who, they find purpose and meaning in hobbies, in shared purpose, in life, in writing, in associations. I mean, the things that you and I are doing with free black thought, I think that as the years go on,

1:54:43

we will be of an age where we will increasingly find more and more purpose and meaning in these kind of conversations and writing, not because it's remunerative, not because we're gonna become the next Altman or Zuckerberg, but because it gives us purpose. We're creating to the world. We're bringing a corpus into existence that wouldn't be there otherwise.

1:55:07

And I think that can make the later years very, very meaningful and satisfying, at least according to the podcast.

1:55:16

Well, the interesting thing is that the more you read and the more you write, the more you engage yourself with humanity. Yes, yes. And you just... have seen things or you have read things and you know things that become unforgettable.

1:55:33

Yes.

1:55:34

Or there are lessons that stand the test of time.

1:55:37

Yes. Yes.

1:55:38

And you just start seeing parallels. And then you think sideways. At least I do. Yes. I try to connect things together. Right.

1:55:47

And that's why I so dislike people who can only write through the filter of dogma and slogan words. You know the writers. People who can only... create if it furthers some approved narrative. That's like soulless writing. You're cutting yourself off from the juice, the energy, the vibe, the excitement, the passion, the emotional intensity,

1:56:13

what it means to be alive. My goodness, it's what writers do. Writers channel the utmost best in what has been so that we can live more comfortably with ourselves and what days that are to come. That's what I think the role of a writer is.

1:56:31

That's what we do. I've always loved reading, not necessarily for its own sake, but because I often say I come from a small town called Black.

1:56:46

I think I use that term once or twice.

1:56:49

And... I know that there were things going on outside my town.

1:56:56

Right.

1:56:58

Like they put men on the moon. And inside my town, some people will say, a rat done bit my sister Nell and Whitey's on the moon. Her arms and legs began to swell and Whitey's on the moon.

1:57:17

Michael, unplug, ladies and gentlemen.

1:57:23

That's Gil Scott Heron for anybody who doesn't know. And there was stuff like that and there was transcended stuff as well. Right. Like, you know, people all over the world join hands, start a love train, love train. And You think about what you want to do, and some people will say, well, you know,

1:57:50

the white man's not going to let you do that.

1:57:53

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:57:53

And I say, well, I'm not asking for permission. I'm going to go out and find out what's going on.

1:57:59

There you go.

1:58:00

And that's what you get. I got that using a chemistry set and building a crystal radio. I said, oh, I can listen to radio myself. And because I understand how that works and I build this physical thing. Or I create my bicycle and I can ride further than I can walk.

1:58:22

And growing up in Los Angeles is like that. You know that there's 87 communities, 87 different cities. In L.A. County. And if you want the best cheeseburger, you've got to drive 25 miles to the valley to this little triangle place called Vegas Burgers. And they have that. Or you have to find this taco truck.

1:58:41

Or you have to find this dim sum restaurant. And there's all of these wonders that other people have created. that you want to find out. And reading for me has always been that kind of, I want to know what other people are thinking. I want to know, and I want to be part of that.

1:59:03

And maybe it's a lonely thing because you can read 50 books and nobody you know has read those 50 books. But you have this imaginary community He's like, I can say Nabokov Lolita, and I know who people are going to say. Oh, I know what Humbert Humbert was doing. And I love the language in that.

1:59:26

And it's such a magnificent book because it takes you into this nasty, thrilling world. And you can really feel what this guy is thinking. And you can really feel this girl's rebellion. And how she's using him and how he's using her and how people in the community are

1:59:49

trying to figure out the secret and how they're living these double lives. And it's amazing and fascinating. And you're just like, humans are capable of some incredible things. And this person imagined all that up. And he didn't even grow up in America. How does he know this? How does anybody know this?

2:00:10

And so I'd look at America and I'd say, America is looking worse and worse and people are living on the streets. I wonder who's lived in a place where people live in this. Oh, Charles Dickens. Dickensian London. He knows everything about broke, poor, wicked people, two-faced people, bumbly, idiot people. them and you keep

2:00:36

Dickens is one of those people, Dostoevsky is one of those people where you can read these huge books and they don't get tedious because the language is so beautiful and so evocative. It takes you there. And your imagination brings you right into that. And with stuff like The Idiot or The Brothers Karamazov,

2:00:59

you just get into this argument with this priest. I'm like, oh my God, I know this. You know? And... There's that weird thing that you can get in literature that is rarely possible unless you get to travel a lot. I found myself, I don't know what year it was now,

2:01:26

but I was in Milan and I was there for a week and I went to a Duomo. which is a cathedral on this huge open plaza. And it has hundreds of gargoyles and figures and saints that adorn this structure. And it took them 600 years to build it.

2:01:52

And I found myself there early one morning before I'm about to go to work. And they're having a mass in them. thing and it's a latin mass and i said i know exactly what they're doing i i've never done mass in latin but the liturgy is very explicit in the catholic church

2:02:16

you know what time what thing is going to happen and suddenly i'm like i'm a part of this I'm a part of this real Christianity that built this enormous building with all its complexities and beauties and idiosyncrasies and weirdness and strangeness that still has meaning throughout centuries and centuries, even though it took centuries to build this.

2:02:44

And they've been finished building it for almost a thousand years, and here it is, and here I am. And books do the same thing. But it's different when you're in architecture or you're in a ritual. And unless you're going to explore, unless you're a confident explorer, you're going to come up with dogma.

2:03:08

You're going to go back to that same thing. I'm like, everything in my life is about this thing that, you know, that I experienced this one time. Right? Or like this cop thing. called me out of my name and they hit me upside the head with a flashlight and

2:03:27

everything is about that that becomes your alpha and your omega that becomes your

2:03:31

genesis and your revelation so you have to you have to explore because everything else is ghetto everything else is too narrow and too small to contain your spirit

2:03:42

which is why the great American novel as I see it would never be a ghetto life novel because it would be a universal novel, a novel of humanity. I think that's, I think the only way to get people out of the dogmatic treadmill or maze is to see others writing by example about broader things?

2:04:12

Because maybe people will see that's more fun, that's more creative, that's more exciting, that's more authentic, that feels more real. What do you think?

2:04:20

And we've done such a dog's breakfast of multiculturalism. That I think we may have a generation that is actually incapable of putting themselves in somebody else's shoes. Incapable.

2:04:35

Incapable. But then you can't be a writer.

2:04:37

I don't know.

2:04:37

You can't be a writer if you're incapable.

2:04:39

No, I'm not even talking about writers. I'm talking about audience. I'm talking about... Look, I confess, I admit, I'm in the Spike Lee generation. In the 80s and early 90s, I wanted black cultural production. I wanted to see black everything.

2:04:58

Sure.

2:04:59

And I wasn't going to be satisfied. I always call out the fact that even Nike wasn't putting hip hop in its basketball shoe commercials. I was like, what's wrong with you? Why aren't we represented here?

2:05:13

Mm-hmm.

2:05:14

And that became such an overwhelming kind of thing that we started to forget that we enjoyed the Three Stooges. And we enjoyed Speed Racer. And Gunsmoke. And Gunsmoke. Right? And we didn't have to be that person looking exactly like us, doing exactly what we wanted to do. Yeah.

2:05:38

And what came out of that is, you know, Michael Jackson meant everything. Michael Jordan meant everything. Denzel Washington meant everything. Oprah Winfrey meant everything. Whitney Houston meant everything. And like in that little circle, we had to police every move that they made. We had to make sure they did not embarrass us. Don't embarrass us. We're your people.

2:06:02

Represent us properly. And then we got too focused. So that we couldn't say that our problem was something we share with humanity. We became boastful and prideful about the black experience. And we had to make everything go through that filter. And that put us... smack-dead target center of the woke mind virus.

2:06:31

Because it was just like, Ibram X. Kendi says it, I believe it, I'm going to die on this hill.

2:06:38

And what always tickles me is, you have that kind of dogma coming from Ibram X. Kendi, but yet, how far removed was he from slavery, the evils of slavery? And yet, on the other hand, you have Dr. Mordecai Johnson, who buries a woman who was a slave, who had been a slave,

2:07:02

and nonetheless recognizes the humanity in her, the humanity in his congregation. humanity and us. It just seems, it tickles me that someone closer to evil had greater power to see universal humanity than someone generations removed, if that makes sense.

2:07:22

Yes. No, that makes perfect sense. Because when you actually face evil, you understand how close you can be to it. And you recognize exactly what power you have.

2:07:34

Mm-hmm.

2:07:36

And exactly what power you do not have. And kind of the allegory that comes out of that, in Minneapolis terms, just slipped my mind. No, because, no, actually, I believe the spouse, and it's crazy, this whole time I never used their names, This is Officer 3 who did the shooting. Okay.

2:08:05

The driver of the maroon van was just the driver, and the partner was the partner. Okay. And there was a video afterwards where she shouted in her grief that she didn't realize that they used real bullets. Is that true? Is that real? Yeah. Well, I mean, it's one of those things where...

2:08:28

You could say something and people will hear it the way that you say it because it's ambiguous enough. But I believe she said, why did you have to have real bullets? And it's like... Well, you know... If you can't believe that people are going to be that evil, your world breaks. And... And then that defines your world.

2:08:57

So people who actually have to deal with evil, you grow different senses. I didn't have any gangbangers in my neighborhood, but as soon as I walked across West Boulevard, I knew who was there. And so I had to grow a situational awareness. that let me know when it was going to be real trouble,

2:09:21

whether when we're sitting on the back of the bus, if that is just talking smack or he's about to throw down, right? And you have to learn that because otherwise you're naive. You have to say, hey, look, there's evil people in this world. It's true.

2:09:36

It's true.

2:09:37

And your encounters with that, then you get to be a sheepdog rather than a sheep. Mm-hmm. Wow. So it's necessary. We need that struggle. That's the thing of struggle that makes us better people. It makes us anti-fragile. What's the old adage?

2:09:56

You know it. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times.

2:10:03

Hard times create strong men.

2:10:06

Okay.

2:10:07

There you go. Yes.

2:10:08

It's like a circle.

2:10:10

It is. But the circle is always going on everywhere. Yeah. So like if you're in Tehran today, you're going through some hard times, right? If you were in Venezuela, you were going through some hard times. And you could listen to people and take them at their word. Take them at their word.

2:10:36

And there will be doers of those things. And reading older books, We're gonna have a problem for a while. We're gonna have a problem for a while with our literacy and our educational system. It's really bad. If you write the steps, Yeah. Yeah. Because there are things that it's way better that you learn it watching this guy

2:11:04

on YouTube than going through a book. And then there's certain things that you're never going to get from any broadcast, anytime, anywhere without reading the book.

2:11:15

That's true. That is very true.

2:11:16

And then there's live music that is never going to get on the Spotify. And there's drama in the streets that That they're never going to make a movie about. And understand that the more production money that they put into something, the more expensive it is for you to learn whatever that lesson is. And it's scripted.

2:11:41

They scripted the hell out of it. So it's an abstraction of reality, not reality.

2:11:47

Hear, hear.

2:11:47

And so we have to get ourselves into the imaginations of the brilliant authors whose works have lasted for generations. Yes. And that's going to help us deal better with reality.

2:12:00

I agree. I agree. And I want to, if I might, I want to pick up on that and... Sign off, if I might, with the words from Dr. Johnson, once again, from Howard University. And it's a nice way to sign off kind of what you just said. He's addressing his congregation at the First Baptist Church in Charleston,

2:12:29

West Virginia, on August 31st, 1924. And he says... Here we are in Charleston, in this little church today, built by the hands of slaves. He has chosen you in Charleston to do justice, love mercy, and walk with your God. He did not choose your job for you.

2:12:58

It does not make much difference in the long run with the high God and his great purpose. It does not make much difference whether you're working under a car with your blue and greasy overalls on, or in a schoolroom with tender children in front of you. No difference who the man is. Deal justly.

2:13:20

And I think that's a great ode to universal humanity.

2:13:24

Deal justly. It's within ourselves.

2:13:28

That's right. That's right. So once again, always a pleasure. This has been great. I feel like we're adding positivity into the public square and the human condition every two or three weeks or four weeks, in case it might be.

2:13:43

May it continue. May it continue, my friend. That's true. It's always a pleasure and a blessing and a boon.

2:13:51

And I wish you well wishes as you continue to write your memoir. I'm sure it's good.

2:14:00

I'm going to find a way.

2:14:01

You should. You should. And I wish myself continued discipline as I remember these pioneer black warriors.

2:14:08

Well, maybe you should say my closing line. Do you remember it?

2:14:13

You're going to? No. Oh, yes. I remember my closing line. Well,

2:14:20

I'm going to say, remember Glenn and John, you better watch out because we're here and we're here to stay.

2:14:26

There you go. You're here. You're here. Excellent. Outstanding.

2:14:32

Now you have to say my line.

2:14:33

Oh, I don't remember your line.

2:14:36

All right. May the habits of discipline give you the courage to take the rising path.

2:14:44

I love that.

2:14:45

See you at the top.

2:14:46

All right. Take care.
