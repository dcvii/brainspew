### Citigroup has a pattern of 'near misses' or 'data faults' in the millions, billions and trillions

***THE SCHEME:** Operational Buffoonery*

***THE COMPANY:** Citigroup Inc.*

***THE NEWS:** Citigroup credited an account $81 trillion, or approximately 75% of the world’s GDP, to a client account instead of $280 last April*

In 1963 Jimmy Breslin wrote a book “Can't Anyone Here Play This Game?”, chronicling the 1962 inaugural season of Major League Baseball’s New York Mets. The Mets set new standards for ineptitude, going 40 wins and 120 losses, seemingly figuring out new ways to lose ballgames every week. According to Breslin’s book, Mets manager Casey Stengel, exasperated by another soul-crushing defeat cried out, “Can’t anyone here play this game?”

Interestingly, the New York Mets now call their home Citi Field, named of course after Citigroup.

On February 27, The Financial Times [reported that](https://www.ft.com/content/9921925e-5a32-48cc-a3e3-3f77042477d2) in April 2024:

*Citigroup credited a client’s account with $81tn when it meant to send only $280, an error that could hinder the bank’s attempt to persuade regulators that it has fixed long-standing operational issues. The erroneous internal transfer, which occurred last April and has not been previously reported, was missed by both a payments employee and a second official assigned to check the transaction before it was approved to be processed at the start of business the following day.*

Unfortunately for Citigroup, this mistake is part of a pattern.

In August 2020, the bank was supposed to wire $7.8 million to holders of a large, syndicated loan to Revlon. Instead, Citigroup wired $894 million—the entire balance of the loan the bank was administering. Of course, Citigroup demanded the loan holders return the money, and three hedge funds holding approximately $500 million of Citigroup’s funds balked at returning them. It took Citigroup two years of litigation to get the money back.

Two months later, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) took joint action. The [OCC fined Citigroup $400 million](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2020/nr-occ-2020-132.html), and the Fed issued an [enforcement order](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20201007a1.pdf). It noted in a [press release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20201007a.htm), “The firm has not taken prompt and effective actions to correct practices previously identified by the Board in the areas of compliance risk management, data quality management, and internal controls.”

In 2021 CEO Michael Corbat was ousted and a new CEO, Jane Fraser, was installed. Ms. Fraser has described fixing Citi’s regulatory issues as her [“top priority.”](https://www.ft.com/content/9921925e-5a32-48cc-a3e3-3f77042477d2)

But the problems continued.

On May 2, 2022, a Citigroup trader caused stock markets across Europe to flash-crash over a 5-minute span, at one point wiping out $325 billion of value. The trader meant to sell a basket of stocks valued at $58 million. Instead, the trader accidentally put 58 million *shares* into the trading system, resulting in an order to sell $444 billion of stocks. UK regulators fined Citigroup $79 million for this mistake.

The following year, the Fed examined the Citigroup’s progress in fixing “data faults.” It wasn’t impressed. The Fed and OCC fine the bank $136 million in July 2024 for making [“insufficient progress](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-bank-regulators-fine-citi-136-million-failing-address-longstanding-data-2024-07-10/).”

"Setbacks like this one today are visible and I know they can be disappointing," Fraser wrote in response to the $136 million fine. "But they absolutely cannot distract us from the work we're doing in every corner of the bank...Efforts of this scale and importance are undeniably hard."

In the meantime, as regulators were deciding how much to fine Citi, it had two big data faults within the same month, April 2024: The $81 trillion snafu mentioned earlier, and a near miss when Citi’s wealth management group [nearly sent $6 billion accidentally](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/citigroup-nearly-shifted-6-billion-wealth-account-bloomberg-reports-2025-03-03/) to a client.

According to *Bloomberg News*, which first reported the story, “The near error occurred after a staffer handling the transfer copied and pasted the account number into a field for the dollar figure, which was detected on the next business day.”

The Financial Times reported that an internal report it viewed showed that 10 near misses of $1 billion or greater occurred at Citi last year. These “near misses” are incidents when a bank initially processes the wrong amount but can correct the mistake before the money leaves the bank.

And that’s actually an improvement; there were 13 the previous year. The FT reported that “several former regulators and bank risk managers said near misses of greater than $1bn were unusual across the US bank industry.”

One has to wonder if CEO Fraser is starting to ask the same question Casey Stengel asked in 1962: “Can’t anyone here play this game?”
