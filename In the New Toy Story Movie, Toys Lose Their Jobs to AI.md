In December, I suggested that the [“tech backlash might just be the biggest issue of 2026.”](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/a-woman-on-a-ny-subway-just-set-the) We’re only a few weeks into the year, but everywhere I see confirmation of this forecast.

Tech is the new kale—peddled everywhere, but about as appetizing as your lawn after it’s been fertilized.

Let’s look at what’s happening right now, with tech is taking body blows at every turn. I’ll start with movies—where an entire industry appears on the brink of getting replaced up by AI tech.

*Toy Story 5* (coming in June) will promote an anti-tech message. It tells how abandoned toys respond to eight-year-old Bonnie’s new plaything, an AI-enabled smart tablet named Lilypad. Like redundant Amazon workers, the old toys fear that their time has come and gone.

“Extinction?” frets the toy dinosaur. “Not again!”

This storyline would be noteworthy under any circumstances, but especially because *Toy Story 5* is coming from Pixar, the studio that unleashed digital tech on cinema audiences with the first *Toy Story* movie in 1995.

Yes, the backlash against tech is so widespread now that even tech companies are joining in.

Check out the trailer, which aptly captures the mood of the current moment. Many of us feel just like those abandoned toys.

It’s all there—screentime addiction, the replacement of friends with devices, the phony sycophancy of bots.

Maybe the tech backlash can help studios reinvigorate their stale brand franchises. In the next Barbie movie, Ken can fall in love with a chatbot. Perhaps Batman replaces Robin with ChatGPT. And the next Bond villain can be the CEO of an AI hypercaler.

(Well maybe not, when you consider that James Bond is now *owned* by the CEO of an AI hyperscaler.)

In any event, the folks at Disney/Pixar clearly understand the public’s growing antagonism to overreaching tech. The *Toy Story 5* trailer hit theaters the same moment that a new survey showed that [86% of the public want tech companies held accountable](https://techoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Tech-Oversight_ygbrvomni_2026_February_A_toplines.pdf) for what they’re doing to children.

Only 4% of those survey strongly support tech companies against accusations of harming youngsters. Let me repeat: Just 4%. There are more people who [expect Jesus Christ to arrive for the Second Coming during 2026](https://x.com/tedfrank/status/2021190297435123737).

And here’s something even more important: [Two-thirds of those surveyed said that their opposition to tech might influence how they vote](https://techoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Tech-Oversight_ygbrvomni_2026_February_A_toplines.pdf). So don’t expect this issue to go away during an election year. The hostility is so pervasive that [both left and right are already adopting anti-tech stances](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/01/ai-data-centers-bernie-sanders-ron-desantis-electricity-prices.html).

Pixar isn’t the only movie company to feel the anti-tech heat. A few days ago, [AMC Theaters had to pull an AI film from its screens](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ai-short-movie-amc-theaters-1236509143/) after an intense online backlash.

The audience was angry—calling the AI film “hot garbage” and threatening a boycott.

This is not a small matter. Hollywood studios are hoping to replace human cast and crew with AI. But can they afford to do this if more than 80% of the public is hostile to AI, and many are willing to protest and boycott?

The same backlash is underway in the music world. A few days ago, the *[LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2026-02-18/spotify-ai-generated-music)* [demanded that Spotify start labeling AI work.](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2026-02-18/spotify-ai-generated-music) But, of course, the company will face intense pressure to remove AI if the public learns how much slop is already polluting the music streams.

Artist PJ Frantz, author this article, warns:

> AI-generated songs now make up nearly 40% of music uploaded to streaming services daily, according to a [recent report](https://web.archive.org/web/20260220163502/https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/60000-ai-tracks-hit-deezer-daily-as-platform-moves-to-license-detection-tech-to-wider-music-industry/) ….
> 
> A recent study estimated that AI artists will snatch away nearly 25% of human creators’ revenues by 2028….
> 
> Suno currently generates [7 million songs per day](https://web.archive.org/web/20260220163502/https://www.billboard.com/pro/suno-creates-spotify-catalog-music-two-weeks-pitch-deck/). If every one was uploaded to Spotify, within a year human-made music would constitute less than 4% of the platform’s music.

If you’re a musician or care about music, that isn’t a trend. It’s Armageddon with a soundtrack.

Bandcamp has already announced its opposition to AI music. There will be pressure on other platforms to do the same—and that pressure will only build over time.

This hostility to tech is now impacting financial markets. Investors are increasingly skeptical of AI— [as I predicted six months ago](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/did-i-call-the-bubble-top) —so [Goldman Sachs has actually created a stock index which removes all AI companies](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/20/ai-goldman-sachs-stocks-index).

What a change from last year!

Back then investors were loading up on tech stocks. But the world is different now. The smart money is returning to the real world economy. The best performing sectors in the stock market in 2026 have been energy, industrials, and heavy equipment. Like those abandoned toys in *Toy Story 5*, the neglected and forgotten now get their moment of glory.

There are many other signs of the rising tech backflash, but you wouldn’t know about them unless you dig deeply—because these are happening at the grassroots level. But you should pay attention when [New Jersey residents defeat a data center](https://www.commondreams.org/news/new-brunswick-ai-data-center), or [nobody wants to lend money to build a data center in Pennsylvania](https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-owl-financing-lancaster-data-center-coreweave-2026-2).

The hatred of data centers is so intense that the tech industry now wants to *rebrand* them. But as [one commentators points out](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/tech-giants-scramble-rebrand-data-233000749.html), “there's no putting the toothpaste back in the tube.” The public has figured out what’s going on, and wants no part in it.

And did you hear the [outcry against surveillance tech](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/17/doorbell-cams-and-surveillance-tech-face-growing-public-backlash) after a Super Bowl boasted about it? Amazon spent a boatload of money to promote its Ring door cameras, and got brutally punished by the public in the aftermath.

That’s the problem with new tech. The more people learn about it, the more they hate it. Maybe the companies should just shut up.

Meanwhile in Thousand Oaks, California, [parents have successfully lobbied for schools to take away laptops and tablets](https://www.aol.com/articles/parents-opting-kids-school-computers-110000014.html) from the students. Guess what they’re replacing them with? Yes, paper and pens.

“I’m just so happy that they’re getting an analog education for now,” commented one parent. Just mull that over. Parents don’t want digital tech even if the school pays for it. Things must be pretty bad when families turn down free stuff.

Two days ago, *[Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/02/21/laptops-tablets-schools-gen-z-less-cognitively-capable-parents-first-time-cellphone-bans-standardized-test-scores/)* [magazine gave fuel to the campaign against laptops in schools](https://fortune.com/2026/02/21/laptops-tablets-schools-gen-z-less-cognitively-capable-parents-first-time-cellphone-bans-standardized-test-scores/) with an in-depth article claiming that they have produced “the first generation less cognitively capable than their parents.” Maybe it’s time for all parents to bring back those old toys for their children.

The next step will be [anti-AI marketing](https://www.aol.com/finance/why-2026-could-anti-ai-113058179.html). Companies will brag about how little they use tech—not how much. I anticipate that happening before the end of summer.

The rising anger is now obvious to all. Just yesterday, the *[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/technology/ai-boom-backlash.html)* [admitted](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/technology/ai-boom-backlash.html) that “tech leaders are beginning to worry about the public’s underwhelming enthusiasm for their plans to remake the world with artificial intelligence.”

They ought to worry. Even better, they should return to their core values from the past—which inspired them to create new tech that the public wanted.

Just look at how much has changed. When color TV was invented, everybody wanted one. When refrigerators were invented, families saved up to buy one—nobody wanted to live without ice cream and cold beer. The same is true of electric lights, radios, telephones, etc.

But now—for the first time in human history—the hottest, most funded new tech is hated by the vast majority of the public. That should be a wake-up call.

Alas, Silicon Valley is still asleep, like Rip Van Winkle with stock options. But I promised that the tech backlash would be the biggest story of 2026, and we still have another ten months to go. If the techies don’t get the message now, they will soon enough—because this story isn’t going away.
