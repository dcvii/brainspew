Has there ever been a more damaging scandal than the abject failure of the governing classes, and of their expert advisers, and of their media mouthpieces, during the Covid-19 pandemic?

The response to the crisis was panic, bullying, and deception. The lessons of previous pandemics were abandoned in favor of tyrannical tactics copied from China. The lack of empirical evidence supporting these measures was concealed behind a cargo cult that demanded absolute obedience to “the science.” Those who held dissenting views were pilloried and silenced. Top health officials manipulated information and generally acted in bad faith.

Failure was universal and nonpartisan—it swallowed up Donald Trump and Joe Biden alike. The human and economic costs are still with us and will remain for at least a generation.

We have just passed the fifth anniversary of the lockdowns, yet there has been a singular lack of interest among the political and chattering classes in figuring out where they went wrong. Accounting for the scandal should be a moral imperative. As the intellectual starting point for such an inquest, let me propose a formidable new book by Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee, *[In Covid’s Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780691267135)*.

The authors are Princeton professors who will never be mistaken for MAGA critics of the Deep State. Macedo is a [self-described](https://medium.com/uplifting-her/interview-with-professor-stephen-macedo-discussing-the-role-of-public-policy-justice-1033066823a7) “progressive academic” and gay activist. Lee’s work has been [praised by liberal thinkers](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/24/18193523/donald-trump-wall-shutdown-congress-polarization-frances-lee) like Ezra Klein. *In Covid’s Wake* is a calm and meticulous dissection of an appalling moment—a horror story told through an accumulation of carefully researched details in which our leaders, faced with an unexpected disaster, compounded the misery by their incompetence and dishonesty.

The Covid story began in the city of Wuhan, China, as early as September 2019. Wuhan, the world now knows, was the site of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, an outfit with a reputation for sloppy security practices. The Institute was conducting “[gain-of-function](https://www.newsweek.com/what-gain-function-research-why-it-controversial-1612323)” research—in essence making the Covid virus more contagious and lethal for experimental purposes. That research was funded in part by the U.S. government, through grants awarded by Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NAIAD) to an [American nonprofit](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/us-government-suspends-fundingforvirus-research-group-at-center-of-covid-19-origin-controversy/index.html) run by zoologist Peter Daszak.

Macedo and Lee present a convincing case that the pandemic started with a security breach at the Institute of Virology. In plain language: The estimated seven million who have died of Covid weren’t victims of an act of God. The cause of the slaughter was human malfeasance, entailing human guilt. Most culpable were the Institute and China’s national and provincial governments, which initially lied about the outbreak and to this day refuse to participate in postmortem investigations. But the U.S. government earned its share of shame. Fauci and Daszak should live on in infamy in the history of science.

The contagion spread much faster than was reported. This had been the case in all previous pandemics—the data could never catch up with the conflagration. According to the authors, it was known from previous pandemics that the speed of transmission would outpace any “non-pharmaceutical interventions”—no matter how quickly they were implemented. Any other measures, it was known, would just be posturing and closing the barn door after the horses were out. “\[H\]istorically, when you shut things down, it doesn’t have a major effect,” Fauci explained in January 2020. And so, the recommendations to political authorities were to act with restraint and communicate the degree of uncertainty.

That was the state of the science when Covid began to ravage the human race.

Within months, the lessons of science had been forgotten and governments had ordained “the greatest mobilization of emergency powers in human history,” as the authors describe it. By early April 2020, [almost 4 billion people](https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-in-europe-spain-s-death-toll-hits-10-000-after-record-950-new-deaths-in-24-hou)—half the population of Planet Earth—were under some kind of lockdown.

China and mathematical models of the disease were the proximate causes for this reversal. In January 2020, having first waffled about the severity of Covid, the Chinese government ordered a total lockdown of several provinces amounting to hundreds of millions of human beings. Pre-Covid recommendations were discarded in favor of an exercise in totalitarian muscle memory: The problem at hand was to be solved by brute force and propaganda.

Surveillance methods included a cell phone application, the [Alipay health codes](https://www.csis.org/blogs/trustee-china-hand/chinas-novel-health-tracker-green-public-health-red-data-surveillance), that “regulated whether and when individuals would be permitted to leave their homes.” In Wuhan and Shanghai, “residents were literally bolted to their apartments or sent to mandatory quarantine facilities.” Here was the origin of the “[zero-Covid](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/)” policy, an arbitrary and impossible goal, the pursuit of which became a plague parallel to the actual pandemic.

Almost immediately, the regime claimed remarkable success in stopping the rate of infection. That was typical triumphalist propaganda, but China’s brutal policy was endorsed by a visiting mission of the World Health Organization (WHO) headed by its director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The mission saw Chinese methods not as trampling on basic human freedoms but as “the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history.” Its report, Macedo and Lee wryly note, “reads like an award citation.” While the authors don’t delve into motivation, it’s fairly clear that Tedros Ghebreyesus and the WHO were deep in China’s pockets and eager to oblige.

On March 11, 2020, the WHO [declared](https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/covid-19) Covid a global pandemic. Days earlier, Italy, which had been particularly hard hit, mandated a national lockdown, the first democracy to manage the crisis with the totalitarian methods of state power and propaganda. Panicked elected officials in other democratic countries soon followed suit. There was no revolt of the public. Quite the opposite: The extreme measures were popular everywhere, as citizens of free societies competed with each other in policing errant behavior.

In the U.S., Trump hesitated to embrace lockdowns until confronted with dire projections based on the mathematical model of a British team led by Dr. Neil Ferguson. The model purported to “demonstrate that it will be necessary to layer multiple interventions” such as “social distancing of the entire population, case isolation, household quarantine, and school and university closure.” Absent these measures, Ferguson claimed, more than two million Americans would die of Covid and the collapse of the health system would result in still more deaths.

Models had been useful tools, though never equivalent, as evidence, to empirical data. Historically, they were known to exaggerate the level of risk—[Ferguson’s model](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/205053/theoretical-physics-pandemic-modelling-neil-ferguson/) grossly exaggerated Covid lethality, as we now know. With his apocalyptic visions going viral in the media, however, such subtleties were ignored. Fear of the worst hovered like a thundercloud over decision-makers. Trump’s health officials promulgated guidance to the states for lockdowns and school closures—and to varying degrees, all went along.

After the lockdowns came a swift descent into madness. We didn’t bolt the sick into their homes, as the Chinese had done, but we shuttered places of worship and patrolled outdoor playgrounds to keep the kids out. It was, Macedo and Lee write, the “moral equivalent of war”—deviation from government dogma could only be interpreted as the moral equivalent of treason.

Wartime unity was imperative. Proposals that segmented the population by risk were condemned as not just mistaken but monstrous. Calls to reopen the schools, for example, [were said](https://reason.com/2020/12/06/chicago-teachers-union-reopen-schools-sexism-racism-misogyny/) to be “rooted in sexism, racism, and misogyny.” Wartime censorship was [imposed on the digital platforms](https://reason.com/2023/09/11/the-5th-circuit-agrees-that-federal-officials-unconstitutionally-coerced-or-encouraged-online-censorship/) by the Biden White House and enforced by the FBI. Dissenting scientists, satirical websites, and Florida governor [Ron DeSantis](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/419253-were-not-going-to-be-silenced-ron-desantis-doctors-fire-back-after-youtube-takedown/) were among those silenced. Wartime propaganda railed against the internal enemy, with an emasculated news media aggressively parroting the official line. When Governor Brian Kemp announced the end of the lockdown in Georgia, *The* *Atlantic* [characterized the move](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/why-georgia-reopening-coronavirus-pandemic/610882/) as an “experiment in human sacrifice.”

Health officials lied with abandon. “[Fifteen days to slow the spread](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/15-days-slow-spread/)” was a lie—Dr. Deborah Birx, Trump White House Covid coordinator, [admitted in her memoirs](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/deborah-birx-guide-destroying-america) that she intended to prolong the lockdowns. “[Covid originated in nature](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/593985/fauci-insists-it-is-much-more-likely-covid-19-originated-in-nature-than-wuhan-lab/)” was a lie—Fauci bullied a handful of scientists into [authoring an article](https://nypost.com/2023/03/05/new-emails-show-fauci-commissioned-paper-to-disprove-wuhan-lab-leak-theory/) disproving the Wuhan lab leak theory, then cited the article as definitive evidence without acknowledging his role as its prime mover. “Six feet of social distance” was a lie, as the egregious Fauci [has since confessed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/05/fauci-hearing-covid-social-distancing-wrong/73962967007/). “The vaccines prevent infection and transmission” was a lie, as became apparent to those of us who were vaccinated and suffered recurrent bouts of the disease.

All the sound and fury signified nothing. “Non-pharmaceutical interventions” damaged the education of millions of schoolchildren, placed economic stress on workers beneath the laptop class, and added to the financial burdens of the poorest nations, but there’s no evidence they slowed the progress of the virus or lowered the mortality rate. Trillions of dollars vanished in a drunken orgy of borrowing and spending, with the hangover left for later generations. “Our failures on Covid,” state Macedo and Lee, “provide evidence of profound systemic dysfunction that will poison our public life if not addressed.”

It’s too late for that. The damage is done, and we are reaping the consequences.

If you don’t see a connection between the trust in the old shibboleths that Covid destroyed and Trump’s rise and his policies, including tariffs, you aren’t looking at things properly.

Between the totalitarian lockdowns and mandates and their antithesis, the Black Lives Matter riots, whatever shreds of trust remained in our governing institutions were wantonly thrown away. Those who wonder why Elon Musk gets to play Jack the Ripper with the federal bureaucracy without a peep of complaint from the public—here is the reason.

*In Covid’s Wake* should be required reading for every American—in truth, for every citizen of a democracy. It’s the harsh diagnostic necessary before we can hope for a cure.
