### Antisemitism and political intolerance on campus needed to be confronted. But assaulting academia rarely works — ask James II — and the president’s approach risks making martyrs of the worst offenders

When a head of state picks a fight with a university, you generally expect the university to lose. Even the richest university — say, Harvard — does not have pockets as deep as the government. And as for armed force, to paraphrase Stalin, “How many divisions does the president of Harvard have?”

And yet the pen is sometimes mightier than the sword, the gown more powerful than the crown. King James II learnt this the hard way in 1687 when he attempted to impose a new president on the fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford. The college still celebrates its victory over the last Stuart monarch each year at its Restoration dinner.

James had thought he could insert a Roman Catholic as president. The fellows refused, instead electing one of their own number, John Hough. The king would not stand for it, though he picked a less controversial candidate for president: Samuel Parker, the Bishop of Oxford. He even went to Oxford in person and harangued the fellows, as Macaulay recounts in his History of England. “You have not dealt with me like gentlemen,” exclaimed the King. “You have been unmannerly as well as undutiful … Go home. Get you gone. I am King. I will be obeyed. Go to your chapel this instant; and admit the Bishop of Oxford. Let those who refuse look to it. They shall feel the whole weight of my hand. They shall know what it is to incur the displeasure of their Sovereign.”

On October 20, three royal commissioners (with three troops of horse) arrived at Magdalen. Bishop Parker was forcibly installed. On November 15, twenty-five fellows were expelled and declared incapable of receiving any future ecclesiastical employment. And yet the king had overreached, as Macaulay relates: “Every successive blow … which fell on Magdalen College, was felt to the extremities of the kingdom. In the coffeehouses of London, in the Inns of Court, in the closes of all the Cathedral towns, in parsonages and manor houses scattered over the remotest shires, pity for the sufferers and indignation against the government went on growing.”

Hough was restored to the presidency on October 25, 1688, and the fellows to their seats at high table. Just 11 days later, at the invitation of a group of Protestant aristocrats, James’s son-in-law William of Orange landed at Brixham. On December 23, James fled to France.

Of course, James’s quarrel with the fellows of Magdalen was only one of the many causes of the Glorious Revolution. It was just a symptom of his broader ambition to undo the English Reformation. Still, the story is a reminder that even the most powerful ruler should think twice before attacking academia.

I was reminded of this historical episode on April 3, when Harvard received a letter from three officials in Donald Trump’s administration, who accused the university of having “fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment in addition to other alleged violations of Title VI and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964”.
