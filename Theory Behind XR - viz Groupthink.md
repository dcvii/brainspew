### Tajfel vs Janis

Q: Was it Tajfel who coined the term 'groupthink'?

A: No, it was not Henri Tajfel who coined the term "groupthink." The term was coined by psychologist Irving Janis in 1971. Janis introduced the concept in his analysis of foreign policy decisions, particularly examining cases like the Bay of Pigs invasion and other historical decision-making failures.

Tajfel is known for his work on social identity theory and intergroup relations, including concepts like in-group favoritism and social categorization, but "groupthink" specifically comes from Janis's research on group decision-making processes and the psychological phenomena that can lead groups to make poor decisions when consensus-seeking overrides realistic evaluation of alternatives.

Q: How likely was it that Janis was informed by Tajfel's earlier work?

A: It's quite likely that Janis was at least aware of Tajfel's earlier work, though the direct influence is difficult to assess definitively. Here's why there was probably some connection:

\*\*Timing and context:\*\*

\- Tajfel's foundational work on social categorization and intergroup behavior was emerging in the 1960s, before Janis published his groupthink theory in 1971

\- Both were working in overlapping areas of social psychology during the same era

\- The field was smaller and more interconnected then, making cross-pollination of ideas more likely

\*\*Conceptual connections:\*\*

\- Tajfel's work on in-group favoritism and the tendency to favor one's own group aligns with some aspects of groupthink, particularly the pressure for unanimity and the stereotyping of out-groups that Janis described

\- Both were interested in how group membership affects thinking and decision-making

\*\*However:\*\*

\- Janis focused more specifically on decision-making processes within cohesive groups, while Tajfel was more concerned with intergroup relations and social identity

\- Janis drew heavily from case studies of political decision-making, suggesting his approach was somewhat distinct

While there's no definitive documentation of direct influence that I'm aware of, given the timing, the overlapping subject matter, and the interconnected nature of social psychology research at the time, it would be reasonable to assume Janis was familiar with Tajfel's emerging work, even if he developed his groupthink concept through his own distinct analytical lens.
