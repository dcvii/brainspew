I'm thinking about Iran today. When did it stop being Persia?

---

Iran has been the country's name domestically for a very long time — Iranians have referred to their land as "Iran" (derived from "Aryana," meaning land of the Aryans) since ancient times. The change you're thinking of is really about international usage.

In **1935**, Reza Shah Pahlavi formally requested that foreign governments and international organizations use "Iran" instead of "Persia" when referring to the country. Before that, Western nations had long called it Persia, a name derived from the ancient region of Pars (or Fars) in the southwest of the country.

So it wasn't so much a renaming as a correction — bringing international usage in line with what Iranians had always called their own homeland. The word "Persian" still lives on, of course, in references to the Persian language, Persian culture, the Persian Gulf, and Persian cats, among other things.

---

Often, I have heard Iranians wanting to call themselves Persians to distinguish their culture from their national politics. Is this common?

---

This is an interesting cultural/sociological question I can answer from knowledge.

---

Have these ethnic groups settled in various parts of the country? Are the major cities more multi-ethnic? What kinds of division (I assume) led to the relative ease with which the Islamic Revolution succeeded?

---

This is a historical/geographical question I can answer from knowledge.

---

How successful have those groups retrenched and resisted the excesses of the Islamist regime? Have migration patterns changed? Have conversions been coerced? Are certain industries nationalized?

---

This is a broad question covering several topics. Let me answer from my knowledge, which is solid up to mid-2025.

---

Much has been said about the use of Iranian proxies in geopolitics. To what extent is the foreing exchange of Iran centered around such relationships? Are Iranian borders closed to outsiders? Are their citizens prohibited from travel?

---

Good questions about Iranian foreign policy, proxy relationships, economic dimensions, and travel restrictions.

---

What is the current population in Iran? How vulnerable is it to the kinds of conditions (like famine in Egypt) that led to Arab Spring -like revolutions?

---

Let me answer this from knowledge, though I should search for current population figures.

---

Let's dig down into the questions of national vs religious fidelity. If educated youth tend to be less religious in the current generations, what are some of the reactions to fatwas issued by the leadership? How divisive and consequential are these?

---

This is a rich intellectual question about the relationship between religious authority, fatwas, and Iranian society. I can answer this from my training knowledge without needing to search.

---

Have significant geopolitical changes in the gulf states been a reflection of the Iranian peoples' sentiments? Are there long running regional rivalries and kinships that drive the dynamic or is it more based on the ambitions of the powerful? How might growing antagonism by foreign countries affect Iranian citizens' view of their leaders?

---

This is a rich geopolitical and sociological question. I can answer this well from knowledge without needing to search.

---

Fast forward to the present. Recent protests, riots and executions taking place in Jan & Feb 2026 seem to be ongoing. What are the major reasons for them happening now?

---

This is a very significant and current situation. Let me synthesize what's happening based on the search results, which are from today and recent days.
