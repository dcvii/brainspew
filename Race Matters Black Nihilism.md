In Cornel West's book Race Matters, what did he say about nihilism in the black community? Can you provide a quote?

In his book Race Matters, Cornel West dedicates a chapter titled "Nihilism in Black America" to arguing that nihilism represents the most fundamental threat to the survival and progress of black communities in the United States. He contends that this nihilism transcends mere economic or political challenges, manifesting instead as a deep cultural and existential crisis rooted in historical trauma, market-driven societal fragmentation, and a leadership vacuum. It leads to widespread psychological despair, self-destructive behaviors, and a breakdown in communal bonds that historically buffered against such threats.A key quote defining nihilism in this context is: "Nihilism is to be understood here not as a philosophic doctrine that there are no rational grounds for legitimate standards or authority; it is, far more, the lived experience of coping with a life of horrifying meaninglessness, hopelessness, and (most important) lovelessness. The frightening result is a numbing detachment from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world. Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a coldhearted, mean-spirited outlook that destroys both the individual and others." West further emphasizes its historical persistence and current intensity: "In fact, the major enemy of black survival in America has been and is neither oppression nor exploitation but rather the nihilistic threatâ€”that is, loss of hope and absence of meaning. For as long as hope remains and meaning is preserved, the possibility of overcoming oppression stays alive. The self-fulfilling prophecy of the nihilistic threat is that without hope there can be no future, that without meaning there can be no struggle." He proposes combating it through a "politics of conversion" centered on love, care, and ethical leadership to restore agency and hope.
