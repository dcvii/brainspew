LAWYER UP”: Former DOJ Chief of Staff Issues Grave Murder Charge Warning to Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan

The legal walls are closing in on Minnesota’s Lieutenant Governor. Following the explosive revelation that Peggy Flanagan allegedly operated as a “dispatch admin” for the radical ICE-interference network under the handle “Flan Southside,” one of the nation’s top legal minds has issued a chilling warning about her future. 🏛️⚖️

The Felony Murder Warning

Chad Mizelle, former Chief of Staff at the Trump DOJ and Acting General Counsel at DHS, stated plainly that if the Signal chat is tied to the Alex Pretti shooting, Flanagan is in "serious trouble."

Mizelle explained the "felony murder" reality: if you are involved in a conspiracy—in this case, interfering with federal ICE operations—and someone dies as a result, every participant in that conspiracy can be charged with murder.

Mizelle clarified that the law applies even if the person who died was a member of the group, like Alex Pretti. Being the "admin" of the coordination network makes the legal liability inescapable.

From "Direct Action" to Federal Indictment 🛡️⚖️

As the dispatch admin, "Flan Southside" allegedly oversaw the real-time tracking and doxxing of federal officers at locations like McDonald's and local apartment complexes, creating the violent friction that led to the fatal shooting.

Mizelle’s warning underscores that being a sitting Lieutenant Governor does not grant immunity for participating in a criminal conspiracy to obstruct federal law enforcement.

In a blunt message to the State Capitol, Mizelle advised, “LG Flanagan better lawyer up. She may have some federal agents who want to talk to her…”

The "ICE Watch" isn't a game anymore—it’s a potential murder case. When the second-highest official in the state is caught running the switchboard for a mob that gets people killed, the federal government has a duty to act.

From now on when you see the 10,000/day posts exposing crimes while zero justice is done just post this meme in response.

Don’t be fooled into acting like it’s exciting or means anything at all.

They’ve been doing this crap for decades!

Nothing will happen ….

DEMs own the Legal System / Judges.

DEMs are Untouchable.

DEMs are above the Law.

DOJ will write a strongly worded letter and GOP will fund raise off the outrage.

GOP DOJ are Wankers 🤡
