### Short Summary

**Highlights of using this device to eliminate mosquitoes with laser**

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T16AAuU7MFk)
- Many people once had such a fantasy, imagining there being a laser machine that could use lasers to eliminate all mosquitoes, just like Star Wars, full of science fiction and magic
- Relying on the advancement of lidar detection technology, this sci-fi and magical product will soon truly become a reality
- Fortunately,we have successfully developed a prototype of the first mosquito air defense system capable of identifying and neutralizing mosquitoes using high-specification lidar technology. In comparison to other mosquito identification methods, this system demonstrates superior efficiency and reliability. It operates without reliance on complex algorithms; instead, it employs well-defined trigger conditions to ensure safety and avoid any potential hazards. When an object significantly larger than a mosquito enters the detection range, the system can swiftly and accurately identify it and refrain from laser activation. Conversely, when a mosquito is detected, the system completes identification and laser engagement within an extremely short timeframe.
- This prototype not only effectively eliminates mosquitoes using laser technology but also prioritizes safety as its core feature.it is safe enough and will not harm people, pets or even distant birds, etc. By incorporating mandatory safety certification requirements into its design, the system can transition from a conceptual prototype to a fully qualified product suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.

### What kind of insects can Photonmatrix eliminate

**Easily kill kinds of mosquitoes and flying insects.  
100% Physical Control, 0% Chemical Residue**

- It can effectively identify and strike mosquitoes with a flight speed of no more than 1meter/s and a size characteristic of 2~20mm.It can also effectively strike other flying insects within this characteristic range such as sand flies and fruit flies.
- However, its efficacy on house flies and similarly fast-moving insects is significantly diminished. If the professional version of the product is utilized and the scanning angle is adjusted from the maximum of 90 degrees to 45 degrees, it may present a certain level of threat to house flies, particularly when they are not flying at high speeds.

**When used in a yard or garden, it is best to install it under the eaves or solar panels to prevent raindrops from dirtying the panel glass. Working in the shade is more friendly to it**

**It can be powered by a power bank or portable power station, providing a good mosquito free space for camping and fishing.**

### What We Need & What You Get

- Our crowdfunding goal is set at 20,000 US dollars. Furthermore, during the promotion of our products through social media platforms such as TikTok, we have garnered significant attention. Several distributors have already reached out to us, expressing their interest in cooperation and investment. The cost and selling price of this product are relatively high; therefore, what we need most are tangible orders from supporters who appreciate our product. This actual support, along with the trust and commitment from distributors, will provide us with the motivation to transform this project into a mass-produced product.
- We offer our supporters an exclusive lowest price for acquiring the product, inclusive of free shipping and taxes. At this stage, profit is not our priority. Our objective is to collaborate with our supporters to bring this product to fruition, test and utilize it together, and ultimately gain recognition and appreciation for this product.
- If the crowdfunding amount does not reach our goal, we will end the project without charging any fees.

### The Impact

- This is a very interesting thing, not only can it eliminate annoying mosquitoes, but the process is also so interesting. It is not something that can change the world, but it may be something that makes our lives more satisfied. As developers, our entire team has a very high passion, and the happiest thing for us is to bring it from imagination to reality. I think for our supporters, actively participating in this project and ultimately making it a reality is also a very exciting thing.
- In the initial phase of project development, we anticipated that the product could eventually be manufactured at a relatively affordable price. However, upon developing the first prototype, we discovered that achieving the necessary performance required a cost that was still relatively high. While our team's location has effectively managed mosquito control, many regions worldwide remain threatened by mosquitoes, which carry diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Currently, we are unable to substantially reduce costs to assist more individuals across different regions. Therefore, long-term efforts will likely be required to progressively decrease production costs while enhancing product performance. Over an extended period, this approach may ultimately improve the quality of life for a broader population.

### Risks & Challenges

- This is a product still in the development stage. Although the main functions of the prototype have been demonstrated, it still requires several months to be perfected and mass-produced. We originally planned to ship in March next year because if we wait until October, the countries in the northern hemisphere of the world will enter winter. However, some of our dealers from tropical and temperate regions requested that we be able to mass-produce and ship as soon as possible, and provide necessary assistance to accelerate the progress of our project. Therefore, we have set the shipping date for October, so that some supporters can receive our products and use them this year.
- We know that our products are relatively expensive. To reduce the additional costs for our supporters, we have waived shipping fees and taxes for all countries. On the other hand, since many countries have specific requirements for the mailing of power banks, and the cost can be quite high, if you choose to use a power bank, you will need to pay an additional shipping fee. In fact, we have provided a charging adapter. If you can purchase a portable power bank that supports PD fast charging locally, you can use it simply by purchasing our charging adapter.
- We will ensure ongoing communication and promptly share the progress of the project, thereby fostering a greater sense of involvement among all backers. This is a collaborative effort in which both our team and backers actively participate. Throughout the stages of development, mass production, shipping, and user feedback sharing, backers will experience the satisfaction of being integral contributors to the project. As developers, one of the most rewarding aspects is witnessing the recognition of our efforts by others.
- We will regularly release updates via Indiegogo to keep supporters informed. Additionally, supporters are invited to connect with our team representative, Jim Wong, via WhatsApp and join a dedicated WhatsApp group for this project. Any questions or concerns can be addressed either within the group or through direct communication with Jim Wong. We will maintain transparent communication and provide timely updates on the latest developments of the project within the group.
- Our project is being developed in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province and Shenzhen, and supporters who are closer can contact us and visit our project at some point.
