It was just after noon on a Monday in Minneapolis and dozens of anti–Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activists were on a joint callon Signal, an encrypted messaging app. A woman was describing a Nissan she’d been trailing on Hiawatha Avenue when a user named “Chickpea” interrupted.

“Folks at 35th and Park report that ICE hit a man with their vehicle,” Chickpea said, breathless. In the background, I heard a cacophony of whistles, jeers, and sirens.

Suddenly, two different Signal chats lit up, notifying hundreds of members of a large ICE presence of “at least 20 agents” at East 35th Street and Park Avenue. Soon after, one ICE watcher called in to report that at least 200 observers had turned up to witness the scene.

“Yeah, let’s not crowd that anymore,” said a dispatcher going by the username “John Longpants,” instead directing the caller to 35th and Columbus.

In the last six weeks, Minneapolis has become the site of the largest immigration enforcement operation in U.S. history. Thousands of city residents have responded by joining various Signal groups whose main purpose is to find and disrupt ICE.

One of them was Renee Good, the 37-year-old mother of three who was shot and killed by an ICE officer last week. Since then, the city has grown even more tense. Local leaders have made it clear that ICE is not welcome in Minneapolis, with Mayor Jacob Frey telling the agents to “get the fuck out” during a press conference. (Months earlier, Governor Tim Walz [called ICE](https://x.com/AlphaNews/status/1923906506472243685?s=20) “Trump’s modern-day Gestapo.”) Minneapolis’s stance as a sanctuary city means that it will “ [not enforce immigration laws](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/programs-initiatives/city-federal-response/policy-immigration-enforcement/).” City employees, including law enforcement, are barred from assisting immigration authorities.

Thousands of Minneapolis residents have responded to immigration enforcement operations by joining various Signal groups whose main purpose is to find and disrupt ICE.

Activists in the region have grown more determined to thwart ICE, Christine Neumann-Ortiz, the head of Voces de la Frontera, a Milwaukee-based organization for immigrants rights, told me. In the last few days, she said, hundreds of people had signed up to receive legal observer training. “The majority of people who are signing up are white and U.S. citizens of varied ages,” she said. “There’s teachers, retired lawyers, and students.”

This Signal network is one of the ways civilians in Minneapolis are taking matters into their own hands. I’ve spent the last three days plugged in, watching activists log hundreds of license plate numbers, share design files for 3D-printed whistles, request the presence of legal observers at the scene of ICE raids, and discuss whether a helicopter showing up on publicly available radars belonged to a local news station, pest control, or ICE. Some days, members start their dispatch calls as early as 5 a.m., when volunteers begin patrolling the streets, looking for tinted windows and masked men.

These individuals came from all walks of life. I counted at least five public school teachers, a divorce lawyer, two medical professionals, a former ballerina, and even one Minneapolis City Council member: Aurin Chowdhury⁩, a progressive who was [endorsed by](https://archive.is/8MR02) the Democratic Socialists of America [in 2023](https://minneapolistimes.com/twin-cities-socialists-endorse-for-2025-races/). One local nonprofit leader whose organization resettles refugees told me that the average participants in these Signal groups are church members, retirees, and parents.

It’s “really mainstream normies,” the nonprofit leader said. “If you want to meet some antifa radicals, they’re out there—but I haven’t met any.” She added that many of the refugees she works with rely on these Signal chats to avoid running into ICE.

ICE officials said these next-door activists have gone too far. “They’ve created an unsafe environment for everybody involved,” said Marcos Charles, who helps head ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations. On Monday he was sued, along with Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem and other top immigration officials, [by the state of Minnesota](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/news/2026/january/ag-lawsuit/) for using “unlawful tactics.”

But these Minnesotans aren’t backing down. Inside these Signal chats, members trade tips on how to build what they call a “rapid response network.”One step-by-step guidesuggests dispatching volunteers to “day-laborer hot spots,” such as Home Depot parking lots, and to schools at pickup or drop-off hours and “corridors with high black and brown populations.” In one chat, “Southside Mpls Daily,” users are encouraged to use the [NATO phonetic alphabet](https://www.nato.int/en/news-and-events/articles/news/2017/12/21/nato-phonetic-alphabet-codes-and-signals) when reporting license plates, along with military-inspired lingo like “copy, over.”

The guide advises dividing ICE watchers into one of three roles: “Verifiers,” “Patrols,” and “Mobile Communication,” all overseen by an administrator who “serves as the central coordinator and decision-maker.” Verifiers, the guide explains, are on call volunteers who “rapidly respond” to reported ICE sightings while patrols circle known hot spots, looking for activity. If two or more ICE vehicles are spotted, the guide recommends deploying a “rapid response,” which includes updating the chat with an exact location and recording agents.

“When they are out of their vehicles, honk, whistle, alert bystanders with ‘LA MIGRA,’ ” the document reads.

The guide reminds participants that this work comes with risks.

“Police have terrorized, harmed, killed, and removed people from our community,” it reads. “They are not the answer to the needs of our communities and they are not here to help us in our current efforts.”

At the heart of these Signal groups is the license plate tracking operation. Volunteers frequently complain about vehicles with suspected plate swaps, different front and back plates, or worse—ones with no plates at all. Officials in [both Minnesota](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/12/24/ice-agents-in-minnesota-are-violating-state-law-by-switching-license-plates) [and Illinois](https://www.ilsos.gov/news/2025/december-4-2025-giannoulias-cracks-down-on-rental-car-companies-for-permitting-ices-swapping-or-altering-of-license-plates.html) have warned the Department of Homeland Security against the practice, which is illegal. In one video of Good’s encounter with ICE before the shooting, her wife, Rebecca Good, can be heard telling an ICE agent that unlike him, ”We don’t change our \[license\] plates every morning.”

“When they are out of their vehicles, honk, whistle, alert bystanders with ‘LA MIGRA,’ ” a guide for ICE watchers reads.

The various Signal groups meticulously log suspected ICE license plates on an AirTable database.

The database I saw lists 1,314 vehicles confirmed as ICE. Data entries began picking up steam on December 2, 2025, a [day after](https://archive.is/LY3gJ) ICE officially began “Operation Metro Surge,” which has [deployed thousands](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/us/politics/border-patrol-minnesota-trump.html) of federal immigration enforcement officers to Minneapolis. One Signal group, “Plates General Chatter,⁩” has a shared document titled “MN ICE Plates Data Documentation.” It outlines the verification process, stating that a plate is “confirmed ICE” if any of these four criteria are present: the vehicle is marked with the ICE insignia, is being used by masked or uniformed ICE agents, was “actively involved” in an ICE raid, or contained “detainees/abducted folks.” I found that users often cross-reference datasets built by anti-ICE activists in other cities, including a “ [Community Surveillance Database](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeign25hjov5cjxt6oei6zp5ei7k4wbkgm4usxhahjkl3wsbi4w7gxu/#search=529) ” out of Portland, Oregon, to determine if a plate is linked to ICE.

On Monday alone, the database added at least 110 vehicles. One user spotted a white SUV outside an Aldi grocery store exhibiting “erratic/aggressive driving.” That same license plate had been previously spotted 10 times, including three times at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, the main hub for ICE in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. In fact, there is an entire chat dedicated to “Whipple Watch,” in which users will station themselves outside of the building just to log license plates. The AirTable contains more than 950 entries for license plates spotted at the Whipple Building.

Thomas Brophy, an ICE official, told me he’s surprised by the lengths anti-ICE activists will go to hinder their missions.

“As a United States citizen, you don’t have the luxury to pick and choose which laws you want to follow and when you want to follow them,” Brophy said. “I don’t understand that mindset.”

But a 52-year-old mother of two active in an ICE watch Signal group told me she feels it’s her duty to take action after Good’s killing.

“I’m incredibly stressed out and angry about what’s happening in our country,” she said, adding that she felt our nation was becoming “more like a fascist state.” “As old white ladies, it’s important we do something and put ourselves out there.”

Back at East 35th Street and Park Avenue, Chickpea told the Signal call, “pepper spray is being deployed.” An ICE watcher happened to be streaming the scene on YouTube. There were federal agents holding rifles. Dozens of people were seen screaming at the agents.

“The only ones killing people are you guys,” a redheaded man in a purple pom-pom hat yelled. “Get the fuck out of my neighborhood.”

Cars, some of which belonged to civilians, not to ICE, blocked the street—just [two blocks](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/ice-protests-students-walk-out-maple-grove-high-school) from where an ICE agent fatally shot Good last Wednesday. “Go home, Nazis,” a man roared as someone tossed a snowball at an ICE vehicle. After about 30 minutes, the agents left. The protesters cheered, then a chant broke out.

“Whose streets? Our streets. Whose streets? Our streets.”
