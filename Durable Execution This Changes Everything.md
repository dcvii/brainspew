### Abstract

How would you code if your application could not fail?

Consider how differently a senior engineer would approach the same project as someone just learning how to code. We can expect the neophyte to create something simple but impractical, while the senior engineer will create something complex but robust. A key difference between them is that the senior engineer, having supported production systems, recognizes the potential for failures—and the need to mitigate them. With each new failure, the senior engineer is conditioned to accept complexity in exchange for reliability. Perhaps they could learn from the neophyte, who embraces simplicity because they are oblivious to failure.

During this talk, you'll learn what Durable Execution is, trace its origins back to large-scale distributed systems developed at some of the world's largest tech companies, and understand why it's revolutionizing modern application development.
