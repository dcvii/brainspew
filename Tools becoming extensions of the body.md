What is the psychological process that puts humans in the position of centering themselves in their tool use? For example, when I become an expert at riding a bicycle I feel that the bicycle is part of me, but when I first start the bike seem alien. What is it called when the hammer feels like an extension of my body - when the world on the videogame screen is 'where I am'?

This is a great question about the psychology and phenomenology of tool use. The user is asking about the specific concept or phenomenon where tools become incorporated into one's body schema or sense of self - where a bicycle, hammer, or video game avatar feels like an extension of oneself rather than an external object.

This is a well-studied phenomenon in cognitive science and phenomenology. The key concepts here are:

1. **Body schema extension** or **body schema incorporation** - when tools become integrated into the brain's representation of the body
2. **Embodiment** - the general process of incorporating objects into one's bodily experience
3. **Transparent tools** vs **Opaque tools** - from phenomenology, the idea that skilled tool use makes the tool "transparent" or "ready-to-hand" (Heidegger's concept)

The most specific and commonly used term for this phenomenon is probably **"body schema extension"** or **"tool embodiment."** Some researchers also use the term **"incorporation"** to describe this process.

There's also the phenomenological distinction from Heidegger between:

- **Ready-to-hand** (Zuhanden) - when we're skilled with a tool and it becomes transparent/invisible in use
- **Present-at-hand** (Vorhanden) - when we're consciously aware of the tool as an object (like when learning or when it breaks)

This is knowledge I should have from my training and doesn't require web search - it's about established psychological and phenomenological concepts. I can provide a good answer without using tools.

Now apply this to learning or translating in language. yesterday i picked up an extraordinary tool that taught me six letters of morse code by listening. I can't explain why I learned it so quickly considering how many times over the years I have tried memorizing by looking at letters, dots and dashes. What happens when we 'get it'?

This is a fascinating question about learning, particularly the shift from effortful memorization to embodied understanding. The user is asking about the "aha moment" or the transition from explicit/declarative learning to implicit/procedural learning, especially in the context of language and symbolic systems.

The morse code example is particularly telling - they failed with visual/explicit memorization (looking at letters, dots, dashes) but succeeded rapidly with auditory/procedural learning (listening). This suggests:

1. A shift from declarative to procedural memory
2. Engagement of different neural pathways (auditory-motor vs visual-symbolic)
3. The embodiment phenomenon extending to cognitive tools, not just physical ones
4. The difference between "knowing about" vs "knowing how" (Ryle's distinction)

I should connect this to:

- Procedural vs declarative memory
- The embodiment of language itself
- The transparency concept from the previous answer
- Flow states and automaticity
- Chunking and pattern recognition
- The role of sensorimotor engagement vs abstract representation

The key insight is that morse code taught through listening allows for direct sensorimotor coupling - the sounds become rhythmic patterns that you respond to, not symbols you decode. This is similar to how we learn native language - not through memorization of grammar rules but through immersed practice.
