**Abdullah Hayek**

The Israeli Palestinian conflict is one of the most entrenched and emotionally charged disputes of our time. It is a saga of profound suffering, deep-rooted grievances, and stubborn political stalemates. Both sides carry wounds etched in the collective psyche, while a resolution seems further away than ever. Today, we stand at an impasse where neither a two-state solution nor a one-state reality seems feasible. This limbo exacts a high cost: lives lost, dreams shattered, and humanity diminished.

To truly understand the conflict, we must face the hard realities on both sides. For Palestinians, the past echoes with trauma detailed in Ilan Pappé’s *The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine*. The book paints an unflinching picture of the 1948 *Nakba*, Arabic for “catastrophe”, during which over 700,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced to make way for the State of Israel. This foundational moment remains central to the Palestinian narrative, as generations inherit the pain of statelessness and occupation. For Israelis, history reverberates with the shadow of existential threats, a people who faced annihilation in the Holocaust who now live surrounded by hostilities in a volatile region, as illustrated in Daniel Gordis’ *Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn*.

The tragedy lies in the cyclical violence that perpetuates despair. Hamas rockets raining on Israeli towns and Israeli airstrikes leveling Gaza led to the same end: more mourning mothers, more orphans, more hardened hearts, and an ever-widening chasm between the two peoples. Violence must be unequivocally denounced. It achieves nothing but misery, and the first step toward peace must be to stop the killing.

**The Collapse of Viable Solutions**

For decades, the international community has championed the two-state solution: an independent State of Palestine living peacefully alongside a secure State of Israel. Yet, the realities on the ground such as settlement expansions, the fragmentation of Palestinian territories, and political deadlock have rendered this vision increasingly implausible. Meanwhile, the one-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians coexist with equal rights in a single democratic state, faces its own obstacles. It demands monumental concessions on identity, governance, and the very notion of what Israel was established to be: a homeland for the Jewish people. For Palestinians, it threatens to deepen inequalities and will shatter their long pursuit of self-determination, potentially reducing them to a marginalized minority in a state defined by its Jewish character.

What remains is a void. Neither path seems achievable without unprecedented political will and courageous leadership, qualities currently in short supply on both sides. The obstacles are compounded by a right-wing Israeli government under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that prioritizes entrenchment over compromise, a corrupt Palestinian Authority (PA) that has lost legitimacy among its own people, and Hamas, whose so-called resistance has not only brought false hopes to Palestinians in Gaza but has also provoked relentless Israeli retaliation, leaving over 45,000 dead in Gaza and counting since the October 7th, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. In this void, narratives harden, extremism flourishes, and the voices advocating for peace are drowned out by the relentless din of conflict.

**The Power of Empathy**

Breaking the stalemate requires the ability to step into one another’s shoes, to truly see and understand the pain, aspirations, and fears on both sides. For Palestinians, this begins with a recognition of their fundamental rights, as former Jordanian foreign minister, Dr. Marwan Muasher, [emphasizes](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/case-new-arab-peace-initiative): the right to self-determination, to dignity, to security, to freedom of movement, to equal opportunity, and most importantly, the right to live. These rights are not negotiable; they are the bedrock of any viable peace and must be acknowledged as central to resolving the conflict. Without this understanding, Palestinians are denied not only their right to determine their future, but their humanity.

For Israelis, empathy necessitates a clear and unequivocal rejection of violence. The trauma of enduring attacks, living under constant threat, and navigating a volatile region must be met with a commitment to peace rather than perpetuating cycles of retaliation. Understanding Palestinian rights and aspirations does not negate Israeli security concerns but underscores the need for a framework built on mutual respect and accountability.

It is imperative that both sides work to understand each other. For Palestinians to have their natural human rights acknowledged and for Israelis to live free from violence, the path forward requires empathy, dialogue, and a shared commitment to a just and lasting peace. That can only be achieved through the two-state solution framework.

**Learning from the Past, Delivering Peace for the Future**

For decades, Israel has adhered to a land-for-peace formula with its Arab neighbors, such as returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt under the 1978 Camp David Accords. These agreements were not acts of charity, they were pragmatic choices recognizing that security and peace are intertwined. Now, the greatest opportunity for peace between Israelis and Palestinians lies with Saudi Arabia, the nation that has always held the key to transforming the region.

Saudi Arabia has expressed a willingness to normalize relations with Israel, a move that will fundamentally reshape the Middle East. Yet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) has relayed a critical condition: no normalization without Palestinian statehood. This stance aligns with the legacy of his uncle, the late King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, who proposed the Arab Peace Initiative at the 2002 Arab League Summit held in Beirut, Lebanon. At the time, it was a bold vision offering Israel normalization with the 22 Arab states in exchange for Palestinian independence. Although controversial among the Arab public, King Abdullah’s proposal was an act of courage, breaking the mold of stagnant diplomacy and offering a path forward for the entire region.

Now, the onus is on MBS to honor that legacy. The courage it took Abdullah to propose such a groundbreaking initiative must be mirrored by MBS in today’s context. If Saudi Arabia normalizes relations with Israel without securing Palestinian statehood, it will mark the end of any meaningful hope for a two-state solution. The leverage that Saudi Arabia holds today is unparalleled, and it must be wielded wisely. MBS has the opportunity to deliver what no leader before him has: a just and lasting solution that establishes a Palestinian state alongside Israel.

**Jordan’s Crucial Role in Delivering Peace**

If Saudi Arabia holds the key, Jordan is the moral compass guiding the region toward peace. The Hashemite Kingdom, under its visionary kings, has long been a relentless advocate for ending this conflict, even at great personal cost. King Abdullah I of Jordan, the kingdom’s founding father and a man committed to peace, paid for this vision with his life. In 1951, he was assassinated at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, then under Jordanian control, for his attempts to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. His martyrdom is a stark reminder of the stakes involved for Jordan but also of the courage required to pursue peace.

The late King Hussein, his grandson, carried forward this legacy, signing the 1994 Jordan-Israel Peace Treaty, despite fierce opposition at home. Today, his son, King Abdullah II, continues this tradition, consistently advocating for a two-state solution and the protection of Palestinian rights. The Hashemite dynasty, as the internationally recognized custodian of the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, has a vested interest in ensuring that any agreement respects the religious, historical, and cultural significance of the city.

Jordan’s role is indispensable. Its strategic position, historic ties to Palestine, and moral authority make it a linchpin in any peace effort. Saudi Arabia’s leverage might bring Israel to the table, but it is Jordan’s unyielding commitment to justice, as it has shown throughout its existence, that can ensure the Palestinian cause is not sidelined. The Hashemite leadership has long understood that peace is not just a political necessity, it is a moral imperative.

**The Ball Is in Israel’s Court**

The moment of truth has arrived for Israel. Decades of security policies built on “Fortress Israel” and “an eye for an eyelash” have provided temporary deterrence but no lasting peace. The time has come to abandon the mentality of isolation and retaliation and embrace a strategy that recognizes the transformative power of diplomacy and coexistence. The so-called Iranian threat, currently used as a justification for avoiding meaningful engagement with Palestinians, is rapidly unraveling. Iran’s regional “empire”, the Axis of Resistance, is crumbling under the weight of its own overreach. Hamas’ military capabilities have been shattered in Gaza, Hezbollah is to follow suit in Lebanon, and the Assad regime of Syria, long a harbor for Iranian militias and the corridor for Iranian menace from Tehran to Beirut, has fallen. Even the Houthis in Yemen, who continue to threaten global shipping in the Red Sea, are now in the crosshairs of international powers. The existential threats from Iran that Israel once feared are fading, clearing the way for a new focus: the Palestinians.

The first step that Israel must take would be in Gaza. It must commence with allowing the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid. The people of Gaza have endured unspeakable suffering, tens of thousands killed, entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble, and over 1.9 million [displaced](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-148-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem) in one of the most densely populated areas on earth. Hospitals lack basic supplies, with [reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/world/middle_east) of doctors performing surgeries without anesthesia. More than 500,000 children are at risk of malnutrition, [according](https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/children-gaza-need-lifesaving-support) to UNICEF. Meanwhile, thousands of tons of humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, have been by Israel’s refusal to allow it entry. This blockade has led to the tragic spoilage of perishable goods, including baby formula, vegetables, and grains, while Gazans [face](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/10/1155836) starvation. Such policies are not just morally indefensible, they are strategically shortsighted. Allowing aid to flow is not a concession; it is a necessity for stability and a prerequisite for rebuilding trust.

Now, as hard as it is to say this, with Hamas neutralized in Gaza, Israel has a unique opportunity to reshape its relationship with the Palestinian people. This is not the time for neglect and abandonment, it is the time for practicality. Leaving Gaza in ruins would only create a breeding ground for future extremism. Instead, Israel must take responsibility for helping Gaza recover, working with international organizations to rebuild its shattered infrastructure, restore access to clean water and electricity, and provide housing for displaced families.

At the same time, the PA must be revitalized. Corruption, inefficiency, and public distrust have left the PA weak and ineffective with over 90% of Palestinians calling for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to [resign](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-palestinians-opinion-poll-wartime-views-a0baade915619cd070b5393844bc4514). Abandoning it entirely would lead to chaos. Israel must partner with its neighbors like Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates, to support PA reforms, ensuring it becomes a credible, transparent, and democratic institution capable of representing Palestinian aspirations, just as it was designed to do after the 1993 Oslo Accords.

The ball is firmly in Israel’s court. This is not just a long-term Israeli interest; it is a strategic necessity. By empowering the Palestinian people and demonstrating a commitment to justice and dignity, Israel can ensure that the Palestinian cause is no longer hijacked by extremist ideologies. This is Israel’s chance to show that it can be more than a fortress; it can be a partner for peace, a beacon of coexistence, and a leader in forging a brighter future for the region, as it so claims. The window of opportunity will not stay open forever. Israel must act now, not out of fear, but with the courage and conviction that peace is possible.

**Conclusion**

Peace is the ultimate test of courage and vision. It is a challenge that demands the audacity to rise above centuries of fear, bloodshed, and betrayal. For Israelis, the time has come to shatter the iron walls of isolation and abandon the fortress mentality that has bred only stagnation and despair. For Palestinians, it is a moment to reclaim their dignity, not through the rubble of endless resistance, but through unity, resilience, and the pursuit of justice to their own. The world teeters on the edge of history, and the stakes have never been higher. This is no longer a matter of negotiations or strategies; it is a battle for the soul of a region, for the sanctity of human life, and for the legacy we leave behind. Let this be the generation that breaks the chains of hatred and delivers a peace worthy of eternity.
