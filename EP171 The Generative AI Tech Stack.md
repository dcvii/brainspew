## The Generative AI Tech Stack

![](![[Pasted image 20250713110041.png]]

GenAI refers to systems capable of creating new content, such as text, images, code, or music, by learning patterns from existing data. Here are the key building blocks for GenAI Tech Stack:

1. Cloud Hosting & Inference: Providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, and Nvidia offer the infrastructure to run and scale AI workloads.
2. Foundational Models: Core LLMs (such as GPT, Claude, Mistral, Llama, Gemini, Deepseek) trained on massive data, form the base for all GenAI applications.
3. Frameworks: Tools like LangChain, PyTorch, and Hugging Face help build, deploy, and integrate models into apps.
4. Databases and Orchestration: Vector DBs (such as Pinecone, Weaviate), orchestration tools (such as LangChain, LlamaIndex) manage memory, retrieval, and logic flow.
5. Fine-Tuning: Platforms like Weights & Biases, OctoML, and Hugging Face enable training models for specific tasks or domains.
6. Embeddings and Labeling: Services like Cohere, Scale AI, Nomic, and JinaAI help generate and label vector representations to power search and RAG systems.
7. Synthetic Data: Tools like Gretel, Tonic AI, and Mostly AI create artificial datasets to enhance training.
8. Model Supervision: Monitor model performance, bias, and behavior. Tools such as Fiddler, Helicone, and WhyLabs help.
9. Model Safety: Helps ensure ethical, secure, and safe deployment of GenAI systems. Solutions like LLM Guard, Arthur AI, and Garak help with this.

Over to you: What else will you add to this list?

## Database Index Types Every Developer Should Know

![Image](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f3238dc-99de-4c6a-a3e3-f1cbfe4dae2a_2360x2770.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:1709,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:null,%22alt%22:%22Image%22,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:null,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:null,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false%7D)

A database index is a derived structure that maps column values to the physical locations of rows in a table. Let‚Äôs look at some key index types:

1. Primary Index  
	This index is automatically created when a primary key is defined on a table. Such an index can be dense as well as sparse, though sparse is preferred in most scenarios.
	A dense index contains one entry for every row in the table. On the other hand, a sparse index contains entries for only some rows in the table.
2. Clustered Index  
	A clustered index determines the physical order of rows in a table. Only one clustered index can exist on a table because data can only be stored in one order at a time. It is great for range queries, ordered scans, and I/O efficiency.
3. Secondary Index  
	A non-clustered index is a separate structure that holds a copy of one or more columns along with pointers to the actual rows in the table. It doesn‚Äôt affect how data is physically stored, and it can use the primary index to locate the records.

Over to you: Which other index type will you add to the list?

## The Agentic AI Learning Roadmap

1. An AI Agent is a system capable of autonomous actions, reacting to its environment, using tools (APIs, Internet, code, etc), and can work under human guidance.
2. To build AI agents, one must know tools like Python, Jupyter, PyTorch, and GitHub Copilot. These enable coding, experimentation, and integration with AI libraries and APIs.
3. GenAI Foundational Models  
	Familiarity with large models like GPT, Gemini, LLaMa, DeepSeek, and Claude is essential. These models provide the base intelligence that agents can use for reasoning, generation, and understanding.
4. AI Agent Development Stack  
	Tools like Langchain, AutoGen, Crew AI, and frameworks like Semantic Kernel and Hugging Face power agent workflows. These components manage tasks, memory, and external tool integrations in agent pipelines.
5. API Design  
	Understanding API design approaches like REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and SOAP is crucial to building interoperable agents. Key concepts include HTTP methods, status codes, versioning, cookies, headers, and caching.
6. Type of AI Agents  
	Learn about the several types of AI agents, such as simple reflex, model-based reflex, goal-based, utility-based, and learning agents. Each varies in complexity.
7. AI Agent System Architecture  
	AI agents can operate as single agents, in multi-agent systems, or in human-machine collaboration. Architecture depends on the use case.
