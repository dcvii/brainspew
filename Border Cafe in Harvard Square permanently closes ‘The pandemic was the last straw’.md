Border Cafe, a longtime Harvard Square staple with music always playing and the smell of charred meat wafting from the premises, has permanently closed as “the pain from the pandemic continues,” in Cambridge and across the region.

The restaurant, which opened in 1987, had closed in 2019 following a fire. The Harvard Square institution was never able to reopen.

“The pain from the pandemic continues,” said Denise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, who called the Border Cafe shuttering “a real loss.”

Before the fire in December 2019, Border Cafe’s business had been hurt following the 2012 closure of the AMC theater on Church Street. Many of the AMC patrons would grab a bite at the restaurant before or after heading to the theater.

Then the devastating fire hit at the end of 2019, followed by the virus shutdowns.

“The pandemic was the last straw,” Jillson said.

The restaurant’s manager was hoping to reopen this spring, but “the numbers just weren’t there,” she said.

“Harvard Square, like all business districts, is feeling the impact of the pandemic and less foot traffic,” Jillson said. “Certainly all of those issues weighed heavily on their ability to reopen.”

The Border Cafe locations in Burlington and Saugus remain open.
