This is the third article in this series. In the previous two articles we covered basic misconceptions about fighting and martial arts and some of the lies we tell ourselves about our preparation for violence.

Many of the comments have mentioned firearms and as we live in an age where firearms are ubiquitous (at least in many countries), we must discuss this aspect of fighting. I have mentioned some of my background before but I was Army for 17 years and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. I was Police for 12 years and on the SWAT team for 8. I was a firearms instructor for 5 years. I taught and trained a bunch of other things like DT (defensive tactics), and less lethal weapons but these are the basics.

**The Will to Act**

###### The important part starts around 45 sec. “Training is nothing, will is everything, the will to act”

This is one of my favorite scenes in all cinema because of the truths contained within. I wonder if they actually knew how correct they were when crafting this scene and these lines. Anyways, I am the training guy, it’s my thing, it’s my main purpose right now. But I will still tell you that training is useless unless you have the will to act. I knew a police officer that was in excellent shape. He was fucking huge and jacked, very imposing, lifted a ton. But guess what? Whenever there was a physical confrontation where he was needed, he fell apart. I could not wrap my head around it. This guy was clearly strong but he just would not get physical when it was absolutely required. So much so that a suspect stole his partners gun and fired it, and this Officer still would not even hit the suspect, when he should have killed him, just kept giving impotent verbal commands. This is a perfect example of having all the strength and training in the world but no will, the will to act.

I bring this up in relation to firearms because if you do not have the will to act, a firearm will not help you. I started this series intentionally with a focus on physical martial arts (boxing, BJJ, etc.) because even if you don’t use those arts directly, that is where you find out if you have the will and hone it. Simply buying a firearm is like getting new hardware. The problem is you may (or may not) be capable of engaging in a violent conflict. So in many of our minds the easiest solution is a hardware fix. I bought a gun, a piece of hardware, to increase my capabilities, therefore I’m ready. But what we usually need is a software update. You are the software. Software is training, software is your mindset. If your software is honed to a razors edge and you are willing and capable of violence *then* you add a piece of hardware and it is a force multiplier. You *are* the weapon, everything else is just a tool.

Just make sure you are right in your mind and are capable of violence. You are ready to be mean and nasty to someone when you need to. This is not only to help you win the fight but to keep winning the fight. Things like PTSD are hugely overblown but when men get PTSD-like symptoms it is almost always because they were not mentally prepared for the violence they experienced.

**The Boom Sticks**

Firearms are like magic, like I mentioned, a force multiplier, on the battlefield and in self defense situations. They are also steeped in legend and misconceptions mostly from pop culture. When firearms were first used on the battlefield they were terrible. Accuracy was shit and they took a fair amount of training and discipline to be used effectively. Longbows were actually much more lethal than the first firearms but we continued to use firearms, why? An archer generally needed more training than a soldier with a firearm but one of the main reasons we kept using firearms had a lot to do with noise. Yes guns are noisy, and we like that. When animals hear a loud, sharp noise it almost always causes them to freeze or flee. And wouldn’t you know it, humans have a very similar startle response.

This is why tactical teams use things like flash bangs, it often causes humans to startle and freeze, or flee. Then the enemy won’t be thinking about killing the tactical team, at least for a few seconds. On an operation my friend breached the front door and I was designated to drop the flash bang in the entryway when it was open. The door gets smashed open and as I’m dropping the flash bang into the doorway I see three meth-heads in the living room 10 feet away from me, meth in a small pile on the coffee table. We make eye contact, the bang is dropped, I see they recognize us as police, we are yelling as much. But then then bang goes off. Those tweakers eyes glaze over and animal instinct takes over, reason has fled them and they scream and sprint to the back room. All from a loud noise even though they initially recognized what was happening.

So on the battlefield we kept firearms around for this shock factor and often times had longbows behind them to actually kill enemy soldiers. But the loud noises and smoke were frightening to the enemy and sometimes they even got them to panic and flee. In modern military doctrine “fire superiority” basically boils down to shooting more than the enemy, usually with automatic weapons, to overwhelm them with noise. If you make more noise than the other team, you have an advantage. This will often make the enemy duck for cover so you can maneuver some of your team while executing “suppressive fire” at the enemy.

So fast forward a few hundred years and now one man can be equal to a mob with a tool in the palm of his hand. That’s a force multiplier.

**What about Knockdown Power**

History lesson complete now onto misconceptions. One of the worst and most common misconceptions is arguments over caliber and the myth of “knockdown power”. Knockdown power is a misconception born almost entirely of pop culture and some anecdotes. “They don’t make ‘em like they used to! Those colt 1911’s had way more knockdown power than theses plastic guns today!” You’ve heard it, I’ve heard it, and it’s bullshit. We did a history lecture already but we haven’t had a science lesson yet. How’s your Laws of Physics? Every reaction needs an equal or greater action to cause it. So in order for a cowboy to go flying backwards out of the saloon doors from being shot, the same amount of force is required at the other end of the equation. The felt recoil at the firearm would need to be equal to the force to knock a body down. And, well, it’s not. Now someone could fall down and that is a possibility but they were not “knocked” over by the force of a bullet.

For arguing about calibers, when we are talking about pistols (which we usually are), it doesn’t really matter a ton. At least not between modern calibers like 9mm,.40 S&W, and.45cal. The difference between a 9mm and.45 for harming a human is negligible. There are minimal differences between size of the round and velocity. A.45cal is about 2mm wider so if you missed the brain by 2mm with a 9mm you may have clipped it with a.45. But the 9mm rounds are faster and you can carry more so these are things to consider. For the main pistol calibers it ends up becoming almost a wash. I would highly recommend you choose something that you can shoot accurately and carries a fair amount of rounds. Generally the smaller calibers will provide this but I don’t recommend going smaller than 9mm. Something like a.32 acp, or.380 will work if that’s all you’ve got/want but they are a little under powered compared to 9mm or.45s. Sometimes those smaller calibers don’t make it through thick clothing, obstructions, or bones. Also think about how much you want to train and shoot, so how much the rounds cost is a factor for practice.

**Heart Stopper**

So the gun isn’t going to blast the robber through a wall from the knockdown power so what damn good are they? Let’s go through how firearms may end a fight.

Firearms stop many fights before they begin or ends fights that are getting out of hand simply by being brandished. Most people have seen the same movies you have and firearms are godlike, so they usually want nothing to do with them. This is a legitimate tactic and in most US states brandishing a firearm is considered a much lower “use of force” than actually shooting someone. Please don’t fire a “warning shot” however, almost all states will simply consider this deadly force or a negligent discharge. In the eyes of the law there is no such thing as a warning shot because that round could go somewhere you didn’t intend and hurt someone.

When we actually shoot at someone there are a few ways we can get the enemy to stop; First, that loud noise we talked about. Even if the rounds miss, there’s a good chance you will scare the shit out of whoever you’re shooting at and they will move faster than a human should be able to, running away from you.

Second, no matter where the rounds land on the body you may convince the bad guy to not play anymore because getting shot hurts real bad. If they are not too worked up and realize they’ve been shot, the pain may convince them to flee or stop fighting.

Third, the most preferable outcome in my opinion, is the shot placement is great and/or lucky (better to be lucky I think) and you hit the brain, or the brain stem leading into the spine. This is like hitting the “off switch”, and the enemy will usually drop immediately and probably die. It interrupts all brain activity and shuts down the nerve center. I will say with pistols this may not always work! There are a million factors going in to this but I have a several close friends who have been shot in the face and head and they’re doing great (mostly haha). Size and velocity of bullet, trajectory, and obstructions may cause this shot not to work but this is usually the quickest and surest way for the fight to end.

Next, we shoot bad guy enough times and he develops so many holes he gets lightheaded and faints from loss of blood to his brain. Now you may be thinking, awesome I hit something critical and won the fight! Beware, the reason our body falls over from loss of blood is because a fallen, horizontal body is easier to pump blood through especially to our brain. There are many instances where bad guy faints from loss of blood, falls, then wakes back up on the ground after more blood makes it to his brain. The last thing he remembers is being in a fight for his life and if he has a firearm he can definitely still shoot it from the ground.

Finally for other shot placements you may damage the enemies mobility by hitting things like the spine or hip/pelvis area. This may stop their ability to advance on you thereby stopping the threat unless they also have a firearm.

But Pollux, you say, what about the heart? Isn’t it instant death? The answer is always, it depends. If bad guy gets shot in the heart with a rifle especially a large rifle round like a.308, he’s probably dead right there. But if they are shot in the heart with a pistol or small rifle, they may have about 40 more seconds of fun time before the last of their blood makes it around their body. They are probably going to die but you may have to deal with them a little longer. In a fight, and in a gun fight, 40 seconds is an eternity.

**Bullets do Weird Things**

Again pop culture is our guide for most of us here. A bullet is going fast so it should just punch right through a body and will exit directly on the opposite side from the entry right? No, bullets do weird things, really unpredictable things (not like JFK or Charlie Kirk weird but still). I was involved in a shooting where one of the 9mm pistol rounds entered the suspects thigh just above the knee and traveled all the way up into his upper torso. Many rounds and almost all defensive pistol rounds are designed to stop within about 13-15inches of human flesh. Some rounds are designed to expand or tumble so they don’t over penetrate. Over penetration is generally not preferred because it means not all of the energy from the bullet was exhausted into the target if it zips out the back. You want all that kinetic energy dumped into their soft tissue and the burning piece of lead to remain inside causing issues for bad guy.

Bullets that may otherwise be fatal can be stopped and redirected by bones, tendons, or for apparently no reason at all. I’ve seen a full metal jacket 9mm round stopped point blank on a windshield wiper for example. This is why I recommend you have more rounds than you think you need. I know you are the best shot in the world and won’t miss with your 10mm hand cannon under stress but you don’t get to control all of the chaotic factors that may occur. All you can do is train beforehand and hedge your bets with the hardware you decide on.

**Accouterments to Complete the Ensemble**

Now for all the gear nuts we can talk about hardware (don’t worry I’m guilty too). Do you need the latest optic, and laser and and light on your tricked out Staccato pistol that you’ll never carry concealed? If you want a firearm then first consider what the purpose for the firearm is. Do you want something to carry concealed for self defense? Is this something for the apocalypse and you want some distance? You can see how those simple purposes would direct you to vastly different firearms. So consider what you want it for and if it’s self defense, think about the area you live, urban or rural, cold or hot, what you like to wear etc. I’ll give some advice for concealed carry for how I envision it.

Most self defense gun uses are close, like really close. The statistic usually thrown around is something like most shootings are within 3-7 yards. This means its not critical if you have a red dot on your pistol at those ranges. Red dots are incredible on pistols but most of my carry guns do not have them just for size and weight considerations. But hey maybe you are thinking about blasting the moslem terrorists who show up to the library for your draw muhammad contest and there’s long ass hallways there. An optic is a good idea when greater distances are at play.

Lasers have been falling out of vogue because red dot optics are awesome. I will just clarify a laser means like a laser pointer it will put a visible dot on the target. A red dot optic does not project any visible dots onto the target itself. An optic is displaying a laser but only onto your optic so you can aim with it. Lasers may still have a place especially in dark environments where the shooting will be close. I’m thinking something like home defense at night. A laser on a shotgun, pistol or sub machine gun can be useful so you can shoot from odd positions without needing a perfect grip or sight picture, you just put that laser on the bad guy and do work. If you are interested in intimidating people prior to the use of the firearm, lasers are a good way for the bad guy to realize you are pointing a gun at them. I have seen several guys not give a shit that guns were pointed at them but when someone turns a taser on and points the red laser at them, they give up. I think this is linked to pop culture again and they gambled that they wouldn’t get shot. This is not an endorsement of taser however. They suck and I hate their company.

I think the most important piece of hardware you can add to most firearm setups is a flashlight. You must be able to see your target clearly for all kinds of reasons. It may be bright outside but what about when the power goes off and you are inside an office or building, or your own house at night? I assisted on a case where a young man was in bed with his wife and woke up to see someone standing in his bedroom doorway. He grabbed his bedside pistol and shot the intruder once in the abdomen. Turns out, it wasn’t an intruder, it was his wife. He thought his wife was in bed next to him, and she later died from that one round (bullets do weird things, even though a stomach wound is usually not fatal when you get to a hospital quickly). This would have been easily avoided if he had a weapon mounted light. Even if you are not trying to identify a target, you just want to see what you are shooting at, so that you can be accurate.

Think through how you are going to carry this weapon like holster and position on your body. Speed is critical in a self defense situation so you must be able to access it quickly. And for God’s sake carry a round in the chamber. When you need that gun you will need it yesterday type of deal. There is no time for you to get it out and rack the slide, and what’s worse in the stress of the moment you will forget that you even need to rack it. That gun will come out, you’ll pull the trigger and you will hear a loud sound, louder than a gunshot, it will go -click-. I have people tell me all the time they don’t keep a round in the chamber of their carry pistol. This stems from being uncomfortable being intimate with a loaded firearm. Not necessarily a bad thing to respect it. To overcome this get comfortable handling the weapon and get a holster that you feel like covers the trigger or safeties so there is no way it can just “go off” in your pants. I will tell you I have never seen or heard of anyone’s gun going off in their pants. If you have a decent holster I think it is highly unlikely. But maybe just in case don’t put a Sig 320 in your pants pointed at your dick and jump around with it...

**Protect this house**

When choosing a home defense weapon it could be anything from a pistol to a rifle. Just think about over penetration. You got a tricked out AR-10 chambered in.308? Sick. But do you really want to kill the neighbors too? Consider the caliber and type of ammunition you are using when deciding the home defense gun. Think where you may end up in your house where a shooting may happen. What’s the backstop? A wall? What’s on the other side of that wall when your.308 blows through it? Hopefully not something you are fond of. A sub machine gun chambered in a pistol round is great for the inside of houses to reduce over penetration. Shotguns with certain shells could work as well.

I could write forever on this topic and am happy to do so but if there are certain aspects you all are interested in let me know. I could discuss training that you can do, firearms or otherwise. Or if people want to hear tactics, for things like room clearing or shooting considerations we can do that too. I also have a lot of psychological and physiological factors related to violence and shootings that I was thinking of covering soon but I will consider guy’s input.

Ultimately, firearms are an incredible tool that is a force multiplier. First, ensure your software is updated and that this hardware upgrade will actually be useful to you. If your mindset is not ready then train and update your software until it is. If you are ready for the firearm then assess or reassess what you want it for. Let that purpose guide you in designing the type of firearm and how you should train with it.

I want you to win the fight. Just remember, hope is not a plan.
