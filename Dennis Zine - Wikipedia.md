Zine as an officer in 1992.

Zine was a police officer with the [Los Angeles Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department "Los Angeles Police Department") for over 28 years.[^3] Councilman Zine is a former [Los Angeles Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department "Los Angeles Police Department") sergeant and a current reserve officer. He worked Valley Traffic Detail and served as liaison for Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker in the aftermath of the 1992 riots. He was honored as officer of the year by the California Highway Patrol. He has been elected three times to the Board of Directors of the Police Protective League, representing the 9,100 rank and file officers.

### Civic engagement

Councilman Zine is a past president and active member of The Executives, a support group of Los Angeles Jewish Health (formerly Los Angeles Jewish Home). For over 10 years he has been an active member of [Mothers Against Drunk Driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothers_Against_Drunk_Driving "Mothers Against Drunk Driving") and has served on the Board of Directors of Haven Hills Battered Women's Shelter.[^3]

Zine was first elected to public office in 1997 to represent [San Fernando Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley "San Fernando Valley") interests on the Charter Reform Commission. In this capacity, he served as Vice Chairman.

Zine expanded his government service role as the President of the Independent Cities Association (ICA); as the City's representative with the [National League of Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_of_Cities "National League of Cities"), serving as a member of the Board of Directors and the Chair of the National Immigration Task Force; and as a member of the [League of California Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_California_Cities "League of California Cities") Board of Directors. He was also a member of the Los Angeles County Judicial Procedures Commission.

### Elections

Zine was elected to represent the 3rd District of the Los Angeles City Council in 2001. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009, but city [term limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit "Term limit") prevented him running for a fourth term.

### Tenure

In February 2008, Zine proposed an anti- [paparazzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi "Paparazzi") "Personal Safety Law" for [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles") to ensure a safety zone for celebrities against photographers. The measure was in direct response to several incidents in which celebrities were hindered from entering medical facilities or caught in pursuits with paparazzi.

Zine was one of two [Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_\(United_States\) "Republican Party (United States)") members of the City Council until he changed his registration to [Decline to State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_to_State "Decline to State") in 2011.[^1] [^2] The [Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times") reported "He said he did so because he's tired of the 'gridlock' of partisan politics and because his liberal positions on gay marriage and other social issues are out of line with traditional Republican views." [^1]

## Post-Council career

Zine announced his candidacy for the position of [Los Angeles City Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Controller "Los Angeles City Controller") in July 2011,[^1] following his City Council predecessor, [Laura N. Chick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_N._Chick "Laura N. Chick"), who served as City Controller from 2001 to 2009. In a primary election field of six candidates, Zine placed second, trailing Ron Galperin, an attorney and businessman who had run for elected City offices unsuccessfully in the past.[^4]

In 2018 Zine started and two weeks later halted a campaign for State Assembly in a Special Election to replace [Matt Dababneh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dababneh "Matt Dababneh") in California Assembly District 45. Zine garnered 7.7% of the vote.
