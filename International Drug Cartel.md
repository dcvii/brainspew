There’s no such thing as “I’m against Maduro, but I don’t support what the US did”

All the other alternatives have already been tried:

\-They’ve already asked him to resign and he didn’t resign

\-The population has already protested and he ran a tank over them

\-They’ve already held 3 elections and he frauded all of them

\-95% of the country is in extreme poverty

\-8 million Venezuelans are refugees in other countries (largest number of refugees without a declared war)

What other alternative? Wait for him to die of old age?

Nothing’s left but pure military power

I’m not naive enough to think that Trump is acting for humanitarian reasons, he’s thinking of himself and Europe because Maduro is the leader of an international drug cartel

Not to mention the oil issue (even though its price has only been falling in recent years)

If the only way to oppose Maduro is by sending the army to Venezuela to arrest him, and if the Brazilian right considers this such a noble and necessary act, why didn't Brazil do that during the Bolsonaro government?

Why do you always need the United States to fight your wars?

If just the arrest of a bloodthirsty dictator has already caused this massive outcry, imagine if they started a war that resulted in millions of deaths

You yourself would be the first to complain. But let's go:

Brazil doesn't have the same military capacity as the US; 3/4 of

They say that knowing these things, it's a bunch of son of a bitches trying to pose as moderate. If you know it's impossible to remove the guy by any other means without using force and at the same time you're against using force, then you're a scoundrel and want to keep him

Everyone was foaming with rage, but they didn't foam when Maduro committed all those atrocities.

I hope that now, the Venezuelan people have learned their lesson and that they never elect a leftist again.

Tell me, what's the US plan to bring democracy back to Venezuela besides Trump saying he's gonna take the oil? Don't you remember Laos, Cambodia, Syria, Iraq? Open a history book and stop trying to score points!

Better to leave it as it is, right?

95% of the population in extreme poverty is fine for you, right, since it's not you who's suffering
