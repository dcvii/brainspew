The Ferengi are one of [_**Star Trek**_](https://screenrant.com/tag/star-trek/)'s most interesting alien species, and their culture, including their Rules of Acquisition, has been fleshed across the franchise's TV shows and beyond. Though they debuted in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ as strange villains, the Ferengi were later an integral part of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, as viewers were given a chance to learn more about their culture through such characters as Quark and Rom. Even if they were abrasive to many of the Starfleet officers on the station, the Rules of Acquisition were important to each and every Ferengi, and they colored the way that they lived their lives.

Cultural differences make up the heart of _Star Trek_'s ideals of the future, and the Ferengi have often offered the biggest challenge to those who were not of their species. [The best Ferengi episodes of _Star Trek_](https://screenrant.com/star-trek-best-episodes-ferengi-imdb/) usually showed both sides of their interesting culture, and they were capable of immense joy despite their seeming obsession with profit. The Rules of Acquisition were a strict code, but it didn't always limit Ferengi characters to act a certain way. Subversion was also an aspect of _Star Trek_, and the Ferengi frequently subverted the expectations that were placed on them. Here's all of the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition revealed across _Star Trek_ media...

## The Rules Are The Ferengi Code Of Business Ethics

![Quark and Nog look on in Deep Space Nine](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/quark-nog-little-green-men.jpg)

First mentioned in _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, season 1, episode 10, "The Nagus," the Rules of Acquisition were a set of sacred laws within Ferengi culture through which all business transactions were governed. Since profit often came before all else for even [the most honorable Ferengi](https://screenrant.com/star-trek-best-worst-ferengi/), it could be assumed that the Rules of Acquisition fell somewhere between law and religious doctrine. Seemingly endless in their number, the rules also acted as instructions for how Ferengi were to conduct themselves in business matters, and it even allowed for the stretching of conventional ethics if it meant profit could be secured.

_Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_'s Quark was often the keeper of the Rules, and he could be heard in nearly every episode spouting off a new rule to chastise his brother or justify his own actions. Rule 285 was short and sweet: "_No good deed ever goes unpunished_." Others included more practical advice on how to best secure profits. They usually sounded like proverbs and had a pithy and humorous twist that helped endear characters like Quark to the audience. [_DS9_'s secret weapon was its relationships](https://screenrant.com/star-trek-ds9-fixed-tng-tos-no-relationships/), and the Ferengi in the show often bonded and fought over the less-than-friendly Rules of Acquisition.

## There Were At Least 431 Rules Of Acquisition

![Quark counting money from Deep Space Nine](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Quark-counting-money-star-trek.jpg)

Though all the specific Rules of Acquisition weren't revealed in _**Star Trek**_ canon, in _DS9_ season 2, episode 20, "The Maquis," Quark mentioned that there were exactly 285 rules at the time in 2370. Non-canon sources like books mentioned even more of the rules, taking the number up to at least 431, but the series only revealed a few dozen of the sacred sayings in actual episodes. In the mid-22nd century, as seen in _Star Trek:_ _Enterprise_ season 1, episode 19, "Acquisition," there were only 173 rules, and by the 24th century that number had ballooned to 285. Besides simply adding to the rules, they could also be amended as mentioned in _TNG_ season 7, episode 22, "Bloodlines."
