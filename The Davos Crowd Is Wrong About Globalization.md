The big story from Davos is that globalization is in swift retreat. And that may well be what the insiders are saying to each other in speeches and at exclusive private parties. From the world outside the peaks of Switzerland, though, what I am seeing is that globalization, all things considered, is likely accelerating.

Take free trade. Though Donald Trump seems to be calling off his latest trade war, the United States has indeed retreated from free trade with a new era of tariffs. It’s a development I rue. But Canada just opened its market to Chinese cars. So Trump did in fact find the recipe to nudge an oft-protectionist Canada toward freer trade, though it is the opposite of what he might have been wishing for. Soon, Canada will have access to better and cheaper electric cars than what we can get in the United States. And even if you think that spyware could make those cars a security risk in Washington, D.C., due to spying possibilities, I am less worried about their proliferation in Quebec and Nova Scotia. Keep them out of Ottawa if need be.

The European Union just worked out a free trade agreement, pending final approval, with Mercosur, a trade bloc encompassing hundreds of millions of people in South America, a region that is likely to be more economically important in the future. The EU also announced it is likely to strike a free trade agreement with India, the most populous nation in the world and one of its fastest-growing economies. However imperfect these agreements may turn out to be, has there been any recent short period with so much progress in free trade?

What I am seeing is that globalization, all things considered, is likely accelerating.

I hope other nations, not wanting to be left out, will scurry to write their own free trade deals with those regions and others. I can even imagine that the United States, with or without President Trump in power, feels the same pressures and responds accordingly.

Perhaps the most telling signal about globalization at the World Economic Forum came from artificial intelligence creators. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, announced an acceleration of his AI timelines. [He thinks](https://x.com/chatgpt21/status/2013861339664453962) that within a year AIs will be able to manage most coding tasks on their own. That in turn will accelerate the development of AI itself, and may hit the point of what Amodei calls “self-improving.”

How does that relate to globalization? Well, American and possibly Chinese systems will spread throughout the world at a more rapid pace. American AI will have crucial roles in the central banks, treasuries, governments, companies, and education systems of many countries. I am not saying that everyone will *like* this approaching form of globalization, but globalization it will be.

Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google’s DeepMind lab, said he might favor a pause in the development of AI systems if all countries and major interested parties would agree to get on board. What is he really saying? Implicitly, it’s that only a (completely impossible) collective agreement can stop AI-led globalization, and the spread of American soft power carried with it.

Canadian prime minister Mark Carney’s speech on Tuesday garnered a lot of attention, but I think for the wrong reasons. He proclaimed the ability of “middle powers”—that is, Europe and countries like his own—to stand their ground against America and China, but he mentioned AI only in passing. He had no solution to an immediately pending world where Canada is quite dependent on advanced AI systems from American companies (often, incidentally, developed by Canadian researchers in the U.S.). That is likely to be the next major development in this North American relationship, and it will not increase the relative autonomy of Canada or of any other middle powers.

Carney has garnered praise for staking out such bold ground and standing up to Trump. The deeper reality is that Carney can “talk back” in the North American partnership because he knows America will defend Canada, including against Russia, no matter what. Most European countries cannot relax in the same manner, and thus they are often more deferential. What the reactions from Carney and the Europeans show is not any kind of growing independence for the middle powers, but rather a reality where you are either quite tethered to a major power—as Canada is to America—or you live in fear of being abandoned, which is the current status of much of Europe.

And what about [Trump’s own speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo2-q4AFh_g)? Well, he is the only American president since Bill Clinton to come to Davos, and now he has done it twice. For an avowed protectionist, he is oddly obsessed with global affairs, and indeed he has spent much of his life trying to build up an international business empire. I do not agree with most of his attacks on Europe, as my view of the continent is more positive than his, but his perseverations about Europe’s decline and pending collapse reflect how much he thinks and cares about global affairs. As the second Trump term progresses, he is seeking more and more of his victories abroad—in Venezuela, Iran, Greenland, and possibly Cuba to come. To top it off, soon after his Davos speech, Trump announced that he was canceling his threatened tariffs on Europe after reaching the “framework of [a future deal](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-01-21-26?post-id=cmkod3h4o00053b6pc71g0f5u) ” about Greenland.

When you sum this all up, what kind of uprising did we actually see against globalization at Davos? Surprise, surprise: Most of the politicians were playing to their domestic audiences. The sunglasses-wearing Emmanuel Macron of France wanted to seem cool and in charge (though he blamed a burst blood vessel for the reflective shades). Carney wanted to stand up to Trump, who is massively unpopular in Canada. And Trump went on and on about domestic immigration and ICE, again topics largely for American voters.

Our world continues to globalize, and more rapidly than we might think from many media reports. It is our politicians who remain stuck in the older world of creaky, inflexible nationalism.
