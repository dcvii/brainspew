Abundance Without Illusions: What Edsall Gets Right—and What the AI Economy Forces Democrats to Confront

Preamble: How This Essay Came to Be

This essay began as a much narrower exchange. My friend [Jay Apollo Gupta](https://www.facebook.com/jagupta?__cft__[0]=AZZ3zRAmpv3u1a8vay4WYx8S4tzFah02hzYD7c-f9J8lNqGbVnK9ySKIoZ8o2PETOEJzQLcN2ZlRZ4ug272vkqgc8675dH_7hrX4QlWOn9C36v0l6rIKiti3hRwiMA-mShrGf9XphbIhXy3ojJBhnswsTBKewzHSwJp-n7MNaNaxAtctGsWlpgnZp6J8vTdJsMg&__tn__=-]K-R), a professor of philosophy with whom I’ve had a long, sometimes contentious but always intellectually serious dialog, shared Thomas Edsall’s Project 2028 essay with me and invited a response. The initial intention was modest: a reply to Jay on his own Facebook post, addressing Edsall’s claims directly and explaining where I agreed, where I diverged, and why.

Around the same time, I had recently downloaded my entire Facebook archive, going back to 2008. Out of curiosity—and partly out of frustration with how episodic and decontextualized online debate tends to be—I wrote a small Python script to convert the raw Facebook Takeout JSON into a single chronological Markdown file. I then uploaded that archive into a new ChatGPT project and constructed a prompt that paired the full text of Edsall’s essay with my own writing history, asking the model to trace how my past posts and comment threads bore on each of Edsall’s core arguments, including my many exchanges with Jay himself.

What I expected was a scaffold for a long comment. What emerged instead was something more coherent and expansive than a Facebook reply could reasonably sustain. The exercise forced a kind of intellectual consolidation: arguments I had made piecemeal over years—about AI, meritocracy, work, redistribution, culture-war politics, and Democratic coalition failure—snapped into a single structure. At that point it became clear that this belonged not in a comment thread, but in a standalone post.

What follows, then, is best read as an extended response to Jay’s invitation, informed by Edsall’s provocation and grounded in a much longer public thinking process. It was developed through an explicit human–AI collaboration: I began with a structured outline, worked section by section with ChatGPT to draft provisional language, and then iteratively revised, compressed, and reshaped those drafts using the Canvas co-editing feature—accepting some formulations, rejecting others, and aligning the final text with arguments I have been making in my own voice for years. The result is a co-authored document: substantively mine and historically continuous with my prior writing, but produced through a collaborative process rather than solitary composition.

I. Why Edsall’s “Project 2028” Matters — Purpose of the essay

Thomas B. Edsall’s Project 2028 should be read neither as a centrist scold nor as an exercise in Democratic nostalgia, but as something rarer and more uncomfortable: an attempt, in public, to ask whether the party still understands why it is losing. Edsall is not offering a campaign manifesto. He is posing a test—whether Democrats can still name their own failures without reflexively retreating into denial, deflection, or moral reassurance. He describes the piece as “an experiment of sorts,” a draft platform meant to “restore the party’s appeal to centrist working- and middle-class voters.”

The animating premise of Edsall’s essay is that the Democratic coalition is under strain not because voters have suddenly become more reactionary or less informed, but because the party’s governing identity has drifted away from the material and civic concerns of large parts of the electorate. His draft platform tries to re-anchor Democratic politics in commitments that ordinary voters can recognize without translation: work, growth, public order, free inquiry, and equality of opportunity rather than open-ended guarantees of outcome.

This essay largely accepts Edsall’s diagnosis. Where it departs is on the question of sufficiency. Edsall reasons backward from recent elections, asking what Democrats must clarify or renounce to regain credibility. That is necessary work. But it is no longer enough. But the underlying political economy is changing faster than any platform rewrite can track.

Artificial intelligence is the missing variable in Edsall’s account—not an auxiliary concern but the organizing lens through which the party’s predicament has to be understood. Near the end of the column, Edsall himself concedes that “one critically important subject absent” is “a Democratic policy on artificial intelligence.” AI is beginning to alter how value is produced, how work is organized, and how rewards are distributed—and is poised to accelerate those shifts. It is weakening the moral authority of meritocracy and making symbolic governance harder to sustain in a society where abundance is increasingly visible but unevenly shared.

It is also beginning to push us into a rapidly deglobalizing world: as AI‑powered robotics drives the marginal cost of physical labor down, the labor‑arbitrage logic of the last few decades erodes, and supply chains become as much about security as efficiency. In prior posts I’ve made the point that once domestic robot factories can match offshore unit costs, the labor‑arbitrage case for globalized supply chains weakens sharply. In that world, China is not just a trade partner but an automation rival, and industrial policy, trade policy, and geopolitical alignment re-enter domestic politics as first-order distributional questions.

What follows argues that Edsall’s project is directionally right but incomplete for the economic transition now underway. The Democratic Party does not merely need clearer boundaries or better messaging. It needs a governing political economy capable of aligning democratic legitimacy with an AI-driven abundance that is approaching faster than existing institutions—and habits of thought—are prepared to manage. That means pairing demand-side security with a supply-side abundance agenda: streamlined permitting and procurement, fewer process bottlenecks, and a practical bias toward building.

II. Equality of Opportunity After Meritocracy — Why AI destabilizes the moral grammar of liberalism

Edsall’s proposed mission statement is aspirational, but its core boundary is right: Democrats should be “committed to equality of opportunity,” should “reject a politics that seeks to guarantee equality of outcomes,” and should recognize that outcomes politics “risks undermining growth, productivity, innovation and beneficial competition.” The problem is that AI is eroding the meritocratic story that once made the opportunity/outcomes distinction feel stable.

Meritocracy presumes a stable mapping between effort, skill, and reward. For much of the twentieth century, that assumption was imperfect but serviceable: education raised productivity, productivity raised wages, and wages anchored social status. That feedback loop has been weakening for decades, and AI is poised to strain it far further—potentially severing it in many domains. As machine intelligence substitutes for cognitive labor once treated as the reward for education and talent, income increasingly reflects access to capital, data, and scale rather than individual contribution.

This is not a moral failure of markets; it is a structural feature of a technology that concentrates returns while diffusing productive capacity. But it carries an unavoidable political consequence: the moral authority of “you get what you earn” weakens precisely as abundance becomes more visible.

The implication is not that opportunity is irrelevant, but that opportunity alone can no longer do the legitimating work liberals once asked of it. In a society that can generate more with less human contribution, the central political question shifts from sorting the deserving to sustaining broad-based consent.

For now, the point is diagnostic: AI erodes the moral grammar that lets Democrats treat opportunity as the sufficient answer to distributional conflict. And in the absence of a credible universalist distribution story, Democrats have increasingly reached for equity frameworks that treat group outcomes as the measure of justice—DEI regimes, K‑12 curricula organized around racial identity formation and “whiteness” consciousness, and CRT-adjacent arguments that neutral rules are themselves suspect.

The motivation is often sincere: to keep prestigious institutions from becoming closed castes and to ensure that opportunity is more than a slogan. But a party that even sounds committed to equal outcomes invites an endless politics of group balancing, compelled scripts, and bureaucratic sorting. It predictably alienates large segments of the electorate—including many of the ostensible beneficiaries, who do not want to be treated as demographic tokens, presumed quota hires, or permanent wards of institutional caretaking.

AI may offer a way out of this conundrum. Once the meritocratic link between contribution and reward weakens, redistribution can be reframed as a universal dividend from shared productivity gains—rather than as a moralized project of equalizing group outcomes.

III. Growth Is Coming Anyway: The AI Abundance Economy — Why the real question is distribution, not dynamism

Edsall is right that economic growth is a political prerequisite for sustaining redistribution. As he puts it, “economic growth is essential to the maintenance of public support for policies promoting fairness, equality, better schools and more housing.” A stagnant economy turns every distributive question into a zero-sum fight, intensifying resentment and eroding support for egalitarian policy. But Edsall still treats growth as something Democrats must actively reignite through better messaging, regulatory reform, and a more pro-market posture. That is only half the story. If current AI diffusion continues on its present trajectory, growth is coming regardless of Democratic intentions.

Artificial intelligence is a general-purpose technology with unusually broad scope. It raises output by augmenting or replacing cognitive labor across sectors—and, increasingly, by powering embodied systems: robots, autonomous vehicles, and AI-driven industrial equipment that can perform and coordinate physical work. It compresses timelines and scales decision-making in ways that do not require commensurate increases in human effort. The question, then, is not whether the economy will grow, but how the gains from that growth will be distributed—and whether political institutions can keep pace with the speed and asymmetry of AI-driven productivity.

This is where much contemporary political analysis can mislead. Many projections jump from AI-powered automation (including robotics) to mass unemployment. But the history of industrialization—and of the information economy since the 1960s—suggests a different possibility: technology often reorganizes work faster than it eliminates it, while shifting bargaining power and the distribution of gains.

A plausible, and politically corrosive, trajectory is continued high employment alongside weakened purchasing power: output per hour rises, but paychecks lag behind productivity and living costs. In that world, “full employment” does not reliably purchase a middle‑class life, so governments increasingly stabilize demand outside the wage system—through Social Security and health programs, disability and unemployment insurance, and refundable tax credits and food assistance. In my own recent writing I’ve emphasized that this transfer-and-credit layer has been expanding for decades, including in periods of low unemployment, because modern productivity gains come largely from machines, software, and organizational efficiency—not from rising marginal productivity of human labor.

We already see elements of this pattern in the long decoupling between productivity gains and wage growth, with a growing share of surplus flowing to capital rather than labor. AI is likely to accelerate these pressures by weakening the link between individual contribution and marginal productivity.

For Democrats, the implication is straightforward: in an AI-driven abundance economy, the core governing problem becomes distributional. Treating abundance as hypothetical leads to moralized scarcity politics. Treating abundance as real but misallocated opens space for universal, legible distribution of surplus—delivered through the instruments discussed below—rather than a grievance settlement.

Edsall even bakes heterodoxy into the mission statement, insisting Democrats should “welcome proposals” from “all sources, regardless of ideology or party affiliation.” One lesson I have drawn in recent posts is that the most interesting responses to AI-driven disruption may come from unexpected quarters, in the old “laboratories of government” tradition. A DSA-aligned figure like Zohran Mamdani experimenting at the municipal level and an America First figure like Donald Trump groping toward nationalist or transfer-based responses are not endpoints to be endorsed wholesale—but signals to be taken seriously. The common mistake is to filter such experiments immediately through existing ideological litmus tests rather than asking a prior question: does this policy materially stabilize people’s lives under conditions of technological disruption?

If Democrats want to govern an AI economy, they will have to relearn a habit they once had and have largely lost: openness to heterodox solutions that work, regardless of which faction first proposed them. Abundance politics will not arrive prepackaged as left or right. It will emerge, if it emerges at all, through pragmatic experimentation that cuts across today’s ideological fault lines.

IV. Keynesianism After the Business Cycle — From counter-cyclical stimulus to permanent income support

Edsall is correct to emphasize growth as a political necessity, but he largely treats macroeconomic management as if it still operates on a twentieth-century rhythm: downturns followed by recoveries, slack followed by tightening, stimulus followed by normalization. That model no longer captures the political economy Democrats are governing—or failing to govern—today.

Traditional Keynesianism was designed to smooth the business cycle. But in the AI abundance economy described above, the central problem is less recessions than a standing gap between output growth and broadly shared purchasing power. Waiting for downturns to justify intervention is, politically, a refusal to address the main driver of insecurity.

The Keynesian task therefore shifts from episodic stimulus to continuous supplementation: standing, automatic income supports—monthly tax credits, wage bonuses, payroll rebates, child benefits, and Social Security–style dividends—functioning as macroeconomic infrastructure rather than emergency relief (and, where transfer payments can’t buy the same security, targeted in-kind supports like health coverage or childcare).

These labels aren’t just rhetorical sugar. In American politics they’re often the difference between a program that feels like earned, universal security and one that reads as technocratic “UBI” or welfare. Creative politicians will need to translate the same underlying transfers into familiar, contribution-linked frames—credit, dividend, bonus, rebate—so the policy can scale.

Done right, this universalism also relieves Democrats of the temptation to do distribution through identity bureaucracy. Broad, legible income support can narrow material gaps without requiring voters to accept group-based outcome guarantees—or to live under institutions that prioritize moral sorting—policing identities, enforcing scripts, and adjudicating status—over concrete improvements like building housing, lowering costs, and raising take-home pay.

V. Full Employment Without Wage Dignity — Why jobs alone no longer secure the middle class

Edsall is right to re-center work, wages, and unions as core Democratic concerns. In his own formulation, Democrats should ensure “everyone who wants to work can get a job that pays enough to live a secure, middle-class life.” For most of the twentieth century, the promise of liberal democracy rested on a simple bargain: if you worked steadily and played by the rules, you could expect a measure of dignity, stability, and upward mobility. That bargain underwrote mass political consent. AI is poised to erode bargaining power inside many jobs, weakening the link between steady work and durable middle-class security.

The shift shows up inside jobs: AI systems set the pace, standardize judgment, and intensify monitoring, turning many roles into supervised execution. The job remains, but autonomy narrows, pay growth flattens, and benefits become harder to defend.

It also shows up as job design changes: more work gets unbundled into gigs, contracts, and platform-mediated tasks managed by ratings, dynamic pricing, and algorithmic scheduling. And for a growing slice of younger workers, “career” increasingly means creator or maker income—content, storefronts, affiliate marketing, small-batch production—where revenue is real but volatile, tied to platform rules, attention markets, and sudden algorithm shifts. AI makes both sides sharper: it powers the platforms that manage and measure workers, and it increases competition by making content and services easier to produce and cheaper to imitate.

That is how you get work without wage dignity: plenty of activity, less stability, and fewer durable claims on the surplus being generated.

This dynamic already characterizes large segments of the service and clerical economy. AI extends it upward. Professionals once insulated by credentialing and expertise find themselves subject to similar pressures.

This is where Democratic rhetoric has fallen behind economic reality. Appeals to headline job numbers and “good-paying jobs” as proof of success can sound evasive to people who are working and still falling behind. What restores credibility is acknowledging that work, while necessary, is no longer sufficient—and that income floors will have to be partially detached from employment status.

Unions remain indispensable, but they also have to adapt. In recent writing I’ve pointed to the Teamsters’ push for rules that effectively require a human in every truck—a stance that would make autonomous trucking uneconomic here even as rivals push ahead with driverless or convoy-style deployment. That kind of defensive regulation is understandable, but if it becomes labor’s default posture, it risks trading today’s job protection for tomorrow’s lost competitiveness.

A more durable strategy is to bargain over deployment rather than try to freeze it: enforceable safety standards, phased adoption, retraining and transition funding, and contractual claims on productivity gains. Supplementing labor income through broad credits/dividends is not a substitute for worker organization; it is a complement that recognizes bargaining power has shifted structurally.

VI. State Capacity Means Delivery — Why direct transfers outperform symbolic governance

Edsall is right to emphasize state capacity. In his draft platform he puts it flatly: “Government must be able to build, administer and deliver.” A party that cannot build, administer, and deliver will not be trusted to govern, no matter how attractive its rhetoric. Where Democrats have gone wrong is not simply in what they promise, but in the kinds of promises they choose to make. Over the past decade, the party has increasingly substituted symbolic governance for material delivery—complex permitting stacks, procurement rules, and process-heavy regulatory regimes that multiply veto points, extend timelines, and raise unit costs without reliably improving outcomes. Edsall names the bottlenecks directly: “Permit reform, procurement reform and civil service modernization are essential,” and he warns that “excessive risk aversion—in permitting, litigation and public administration—has slowed innovation, infrastructure and growth.” Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson make a parallel “abundance” argument: you cannot run on big promises while governing in ways that make it systematically hard to build. In my own writing I’ve made a similar point in plainer terms: regulations need periodic pruning—otherwise the rulebook accumulates until large projects become de facto illegal. The political cost is obvious: when people see major facilities or infrastructure built in a few months in one jurisdiction and stalled for years in another, they don’t infer moral seriousness—they infer incapacity.

Direct transfer payments, in-kind benefits, and a small set of universal service entitlements bypass this failure mode. The hard part isn’t announcing a program; it’s building a system that reliably delivers a monthly credit, wage supplement, or dividend on time, at scale, with low friction. That requires accurate records, competent administration, fraud prevention, and fiscal discipline. When done well, it demonstrates capacity in the most legible way possible: people see the benefit, understand its source, and can judge whether government has delivered on its word.

This is why transfer payments, in-kind benefits, and a small set of universal, low-friction services consistently outperform more intricate policy designs in public trust. They do not require citizens to decode regulatory effects or defer to expert intermediaries. They do not hinge on compliance with shifting ideological norms. They arrive without instruction manuals or moral lectures attached.

By contrast, many of the institutional practices Democrats have elevated in the name of equity or inclusion function as symbolic state capacity: highly visible to elites, complicated or intrusive to administer, and largely opaque to ordinary citizens. In practice, they can also feel arbitrary—favoring some groups, disfavoring others, and shifting with institutional fashion rather than clear public rules. Worse, they are often experienced not as help but as surveillance, compulsion, or accusation.

VII. Abundance as a Culture-War De-Escalator — Why material security lowers symbolic conflict

Edsall is right to argue that the Democratic Party has paid an electoral price for allowing culture-war issues to dominate its public identity. He proposes that Democrats “reject ideological conformity” and “affirm freedom of inquiry, open debate and academic freedom.” Where his analysis can be pushed further is in explaining why these conflicts have become so intense, so moralized, and so resistant to de-escalation. The answer is not simply activist excess or media distortion—and it is not reliably explained by broad working‑class material insecurity.

In my recent writing, drawing on Musa al‑Gharbi’s account, I’ve argued that what gets called “wokeness” is often an intra‑elite status system: symbolic professionals competing for scarce prestige, institutional authority, and career slots in universities, media, NGOs, tech, and the professions. In that world, moral language functions as credentialing and gatekeeping—marking insiders, disciplining dissent, and rationalizing why some people deserve advancement while others deserve exclusion.

That dynamic can spill outward into mass politics, but it originates upstream, in institutions where symbolic status is the main currency. Material insecurity may shape how the wider electorate receives or resists these projects, yet the engine of escalation is frequently elite competition rather than popular demand for compensation.

An abundance-oriented political economy changes this dynamic. The key insecurity in the symbolic economy is often positional—status within a hierarchy of credentials, influence, and prestige—rather than simply material. As AI systems approach (and in some domains surpass) elite human performance, the scarcity value of “elite human capital” erodes, and a much wider share of knowledge workers become exposed to displacement, deskilling, and loss of status. In that setting, Democrats will need a universalist politics for the symbolic economy that doesn’t bifurcate the workforce into victims and victimizers, because almost everyone becomes a potential victim of superior AIs. Universal provision does not resolve moral disagreement, but it lowers its temperature by reducing the sense that the only thing left to fight over is symbolic status.

If Democrats want to reduce the salience of culture-war conflict, they should stop treating it as a messaging problem and start treating it as a political-economy problem.

VIII. Can Democrats Actually Say “No”? — The institutional limits of platform politics

Edsall’s project rests on an implicit but demanding premise: that the Democratic Party is capable of drawing boundaries within its own coalition. His platform clarifies positions on culture, crime, immigration, and governance not merely to persuade voters, but to signal restraint—to show that Democrats can say “no” to excesses that have come to define the party’s public image. The difficulty is that platforms do not govern parties. Institutions do—and many of the most polarizing norms originate upstream of electoral politics.

Over the past two decades, much of the Democratic Party’s cultural authority has migrated away from elected officials and toward universities, nonprofit organizations, professional associations, HR departments, and media ecosystems. These institutions do not respond primarily to party platforms or electoral incentives. They respond to credentialing norms, reputational pressures, and intra-elite competition inside the symbolic prestige economy, where moral language often functions as credentialing and gatekeeping. As AI begins to threaten the scarcity value of elite cognitive work, those status competitions are likely to intensify, not fade. Attempts at rhetorical moderation at the level of party leadership are therefore often overridden by institutional practices experienced by voters as coercive, intrusive, or dismissive.

This creates a credibility trap. Democrats can disavow performative DEI, compelled speech, or grievance-based bureaucracies on paper while continuing to benefit from—indeed, rely on—the institutions that enforce those norms in practice. Voters notice the discrepancy. They infer, reasonably, that official statements are tactical rather than binding.

Abundance-based universalism offers a partial way out. By shifting the center of political gravity toward policies that deliver tangible, universal benefits, Democrats can reduce the relative influence of institutions whose power rests on symbolic adjudication. In a symbolic economy where more people may feel exposed to displacement or deskilling, universal provision can also make it easier to speak in a common language of security—without dividing the electorate into victims and victimizers.

IX. Conclusion: Updating Edsall for the World That’s Arriving — Why AI makes reform both harder and more necessary

Thomas Edsall is right about the nature of the Democratic Party’s predicament. The coalition has frayed. Working- and middle-class voters no longer assume the party governs in their interests. Cultural signaling has crowded out material delivery. These are empirical realities that show up in election results, polling, and voter behavior.

Where this essay presses Edsall’s argument is on timing and causal weight. Artificial intelligence appears poised to accelerate the distributional dynamics described above—weakening the link between effort and reward and making symbolic governance increasingly intolerable.

The core claim here is straightforward:

\-Growth without redistribution breeds resentment.

\-Redistribution framed through moral accusation breeds backlash.

\-AI makes possible a third path: universal, legible, non‑moralizing distribution of surplus in an economy that is increasingly abundant but politically mismanaged.

Direct transfers, wage supplements, and social dividends are not speculative experiments. They are rapidly becoming the minimum infrastructure required to align democratic consent with technological reality—and they will likely emerge first through pragmatic experimentation that cuts across today’s ideological divides, rather than from any single faction’s orthodoxy. But viability will depend on political translation: the policy has to be packaged as an American form of earned security—a credit, dividend, bonus, or rebate—rather than as “UBI” or “welfare.”

This is why abundance liberalism is not a distraction from Edsall’s project, but its completion. A Democratic Party that wants to govern beyond 2028 must stop treating abundance as hypothetical and culture war as destiny. It must demonstrate—through visible delivery rather than moral performance—that prosperity can be shared without humiliation, that disagreement need not imply deprivation, and that government can make life materially more secure.

Edsall’s platform sketches the outlines of restraint, seriousness, and competence. AI will determine whether those virtues can be made credible. The question facing Democrats is no longer whether adaptation is necessary, but whether they will adapt in time—before abundance hardens into inequality and reform becomes indistinguishable from regret.
