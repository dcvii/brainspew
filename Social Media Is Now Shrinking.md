### And their latest move is a "jump the shark" moment that will accelerate the decline

Meta made a shocking admission during a San Francisco court hearing a few days ago.

The company’s lawyer expressed deep concern about jury selection—because so many people dislike Meta and Mark Zuckerberg. This resulted in [a revealing conversation](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.330648/gov.uscourts.cand.330648.529.1.pdf):

> THE COURT: Are you concerned that Meta is a widely hated and reviled company?….
> 
> MR. CLUBOK: Frankly, Your Honor, yes. We are concerned—and there has been lots of public reporting. I mean, a Pew Research survey earlier this year found that 67 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of Mark Zuckerberg. That’s really high.

The Pew numbers are so bad that even Elon Musk has a higher favorability rating than Mark Zuckerberg. For most people it’s like deciding whether Godzilla or King Kong is better at destroying their city.

Pew didn’t include Luigi Mangione in this survey, but he might have better luck in a jury trial than either of those tech titans.

What’s going on? Back in 2017, Facebook had a [79% approval rating](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/trust-facebook-has-dropped-51-percent-cambridge-analytica-scandal-n867011), and its reputation was steadily rising. And in 2015, Zuckerberg was picked as one of the most beloved CEOs in the world—with [95% approval](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/glassdoor-announces-highest-rated-ceos-040000204.html) among his employees.

Not anymore. [A separate poll](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4583555-majority-of-us-voters-hold-unfavorable-views-of-bezos-zuckerberg-poll/), conducted by the Tech Oversight Project, got the same results as Pew—65% of respondents expressed an unfavorable opinion of Mark Zuckerberg. The average person, [according to](https://futurism.com/zuckerberg-makeover-annoying-poll) *[Futurism](https://futurism.com/zuckerberg-makeover-annoying-poll)*, “finds him repulsive.”

Is it really that bad for Zuck and Musk? Or is there a way they might regain our trust?

I guess nobody is surprised that tech companies have made enemies, but the sheer number of them is impressive. Two-thirds of the public now dislike the largest social media company in the world.

This is the same company that keeps folks connected to Mom and Dad and all their school friends and former colleagues. Well, to be honest, that’s what Meta did a few years ago—before switching its emphasis to virtual reality, AI, and the addictive doomscrolling of short videos.

Maybe that switcheroo explains the hostility. Instead of keeping us connected to people, Meta now works to *disconnect* everybody—spending hundreds of billions of dollars on technology that isolates us from our surrounding world and our real social network.

It’s hard to deny it. Facebook forgot its core mission. Now users are unhappy.

Other recent surveys back this up.

The [research group GWI](https://www.gwi.com/) has tracked the online activities of 250,000 adults in 50 countries, and their recent results are revealing. All the effort spent by platforms to [create addictive interfaces](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024) is now backfiring.

Most people don’t want to be addicts.

So they spend less time on social media. And when they give in to the impulse to scroll, they feel bad about it afterwards. The turning point happened 2-3 years ago, when the casino-like endlessly scrolling interface got adopted by all the large players.

Time spent on social media has declined 10% since 2022, [according to the](https://www.ft.com/content/a0724dd9-0346-4df3-80f5-d6572c93a863) *[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/a0724dd9-0346-4df3-80f5-d6572c93a863)*. But even more shocking is how social media fail to support users. They no longer connect with their loved ones. They don’t meet new people online. They don’t even share opinions or talk about themselves.

Instead, social media users just mindlessly scroll—because the platforms encourage this addictive behavior. That has turned “social media into anti-social media,” [according to John Burn-Murdoch of the](https://www.ft.com/content/a0724dd9-0346-4df3-80f5-d6572c93a863) *[FT](https://www.ft.com/content/a0724dd9-0346-4df3-80f5-d6572c93a863).*

Even the people who use it admit they are just wasting time.

Zuckerberg himself is in denial. In his own court testimony, he admits that the time people spend on social media has [“gone down meaningfully.”](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/zuckerberg-says-facebook-instagram-engagement-declined-meaingfully/745724/) But he has a peculiar explanation for this—he claims that people have switched to texting.

The sagacious Mr. Z doesn’t seem to realize that he forced them to do this. People joined these platforms for the social connection, but the apps no longer fill that need—instead they serve up an endless feed of crappy videos, ads, and promoted posts. That’s why so many people just walk away—we haven’t changed, but the platforms have.

I’m one of them. Ten years ago, I posted on Twitter ten times per day. By 2022, I was doing half as much. Nowadays, I almost never post on the site.

The same is true for Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Bluesky. I have accounts on all these platforms, but mostly ignore them nowadays. I have zero interest in participating in their control-and-surveillance schemes.

I feel manipulated by these apps. And I rebel against manipulation—almost to an extreme. It’s a deep-set character trait, and has been since my teen years. But this resistance to manipulation has served me well over the years, almost as a kind of early warning system telling me who I can trust, and who I must avoid.

And now it tells me to avoid the big web platforms.

But what a change! Not long ago, I enjoyed social media, and viewed it as a positive force. That’s what makes this turnaround so shocking. The platforms have degraded so much that even formerly enthusiastic users (like me) have turned against them.

The only place I post regularly now is Substack Notes. Here I feel part of a real community of flesh-and-blood people. And the platforms supports the community—not the other way around.

My guess is that this is why Substack has grown substantially since 2022, while other platforms have shrunk or stagnated.

Even youngsters—the core target of the addictive scrolling videos—are increasingly upset at these platforms. [According to](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/20/almost-half-of-young-people-would-prefer-a-world-without-internet-uk-study-finds) *[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/20/almost-half-of-young-people-would-prefer-a-world-without-internet-uk-study-finds)*, a survey of British teens showed

- “46% said they would rather be young in a world without the internet altogether.”
- “68% said they felt the time they spent online was detrimental to their mental health.”
- “Nearly 70% feel worse after using social media.”

The decline is evident everywhere, from [Instagram](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/zuckerberg-says-facebook-instagram-engagement-declined-meaingfully/745724/) to [Bluesky](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/bluesky-reaches-38-million-users-slowing-growth/757025/) to [Snapchat](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/snapchat-ceo-spiegel-outlines-growth-strategy-ar-glasses/759683/). Each platform is different, but those differences are less important than the tarnished image of all social media. The backlash is happening across the board.

And there’s growing evidence that people feel better after leaving social media— [especially excessive users,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178118306073) who now rediscover their lives. Just one week away from the apps leads to noticeable stress reduction.

A Reddit thread that asked about this, got hundreds of responses. [Here’s one response](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/16bpc5y/comment/jzf595x/) —that claims eight separate benefits from walking away:

> My life is much better!
> 
> I actually call and meet with friends and get acquainted with new real people:)
> 
> Because I don’t follow social media, friends tell me all the news. I am very interested because I don’t know what’s happening in their lives unless they tell me. I am also more engaged asking questions for the same reason:)
> 
> I feel more secure in life because I have real people in my circles:)
> 
> I feel happier and more balanced, and I have more time to enjoy living.
> 
> My sleep has improved.
> 
> I am learning more about myself because I have time to think and experience things for myself.
> 
> I don’t make weird trendy purchases of things I find advertised:)
> 
> Overall I experienced great improvement in my life by cutting mindless scrolling.

Here’s [another response](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/16bpc5y/comment/jzgl73e/):

> I quit social media a few months ago and I feel more peaceful and focused on my own life. I used to wake up and scroll through Instagram or TikTok first thing in the morning and I didn’t realize how much it affected my mood throughout the day. I would feel shitty because let’s be real social media is a game of comparison. I also feel less pressured to live a certain way, have certain things in my life or have accomplished said things at said point in my life. Now I have more control of my life and how I feel about it.

You can read through [dozens of these testimonials](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/16bpc5y/people_who_quit_social_media_is_your_life_better/). The enthusiasm level is off the charts, almost like some kind of revival meeting. But these are just ordinary people who decided to say no to Silicon Valley.

How have social media companies responded to this decline? You might think that they would return to their original mission of connecting people with each other. But they are actually doing the opposite.

They are now embracing AI as a way to marginalize human communication even further. Both Meta and OpenAI are launching new platforms that only feature AI-generated content.

This is the moment that social media “jumped the shark,” [according to the](https://www.ft.com/content/a0724dd9-0346-4df3-80f5-d6572c93a863) *[FT](https://www.ft.com/content/a0724dd9-0346-4df3-80f5-d6572c93a863).* And I don’t disagree. This doubling down on dehumanized interactions may attract some users, but most people feel revulsion at this.

It’s like those guys who gave up on dating and bought an inflatable doll instead. That’s a pathetic substitute, and everybody feels that instinctively without having to create a long “pros and cons” list. AI is much the same. You can use it to replace the people in your life—go ahead, nobody will stop you. But it still feels creepy.

If social media apps want to bring back their fleeing audience, they need something better than slop AI videos. And it’s not hard to figure out what that *something* is—namely the human connection.

That’s what people are hungry for. And they’re more hungry for it because the Internet has left them isolated and lonely, cut off from the world like high-tech hermits in some digital desert.

Let me put it another way. Social media must learn to be *sociable* again. Not long ago, they knew how—they just forgot. Or maybe they got too greedy and started chasing other goals.

But there is a way back.

Let me suggest that Meta test another new platform alongside its new AI slop service. This new platform would keep people in touch with family and friends—with no surveillance or manipulation. Ditch the addictive endless scroll and algorithmic tyranny. Help people re-connect with the world they lost.

I’ll even let the app-masters sell a few ads. Go ahead, make a buck. But give us back control over our feed.

Put that platform up there alongside the AI slop machine. And see which one people choose.

I already know which option will win. But the results might surprise the ruling slop-master back in the Zuckerberg bunker.

If Zuckerberg and Musk (and the other digital demigods) refuse to give us back our lives, someone else will—it’s just a matter of time. Sure, it’s hard to compete with those huge platforms because of all the network effects. But these huge companies are starting to crack.

And the more they embrace the three A’s—addiction, algorithm, and AI—the more vulnerable they get. Let’s see how long it takes them to figure that out.
