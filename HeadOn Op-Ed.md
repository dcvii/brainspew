### **Why the U.S. Should Welcome Jordan’s Increased Role in the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process**

The United States should embrace an expanded role for Jordan in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Jordan’s historical, demographic, and geopolitical ties to Palestine make it uniquely positioned to contribute constructively to the pursuit of a sustainable solution.

#### **Historical Context and Jordan’s Role**

Jordan and Palestine were historically separate territories, each with distinct cultural identities shaped over thousands of years. However, these distinctions began to blur after the establishment of Israel in 1948 and the Arab-Israeli war in 1967, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sought refuge in Jordan. Today, Palestinians and their descendants form a significant portion of Jordan’s population, intertwining the two territories' fates. This demographic reality underscores the Jordanian government’s vested interest in realizing an independent Palestine.

From the 1940s to the 1990s, Jordan was the leading external advocate for a Palestinian state. Its custodianship of Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem further highlights its central role in the Israeli-Palestinian dynamic. However, the initiation of the Oslo Peace Process in the 1990s caught Jordan by surprise. This development shifted much of the responsibility for peace negotiations to the Palestinian Authority (PA), with Jordan subsequently stepping back from a leadership role. Despite this, Jordan’s ties to the Palestinian cause remain inextricable, with its interests deeply connected to the outcomes of the peace process.

#### **Current Dynamics and Challenges**

The geopolitical landscape today mirrors scenarios envisioned by Jordanian and Palestinian scholars in the past as detailed in _Jordanian-Palestinian Relations: Where to?_ One such scenario, the “Functional” route, predicted a hardline Israeli government dictating the terms of the peace process, while weakened Palestinian and Jordanian leadership reacted to events. This closely resembles the current situation, where the Netanyahu-led government has taken a hardline stance, while a weakened PA struggles to assert authority.

This presents an opportunity for Jordan to step in as a stabilizing force. Its historical advocacy for Palestine, coupled with its custodianship of Jerusalem’s Islamic sites and shared concerns over regional stability, positions it as a credible partner for peace.

#### **The U.S. Role and Strategic Opportunity**

The United States should welcome Jordan’s re-engagement in the peace process. As a steadfast U.S. ally, Jordan’s increased involvement could deepen bilateral relations and enhance U.S. influence in the region. With American support, Jordan could help address both Israeli and Palestinian security concerns, laying the groundwork for an autonomous Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.

Jordan’s involvement is also crucial for its own national interests. The outcomes of the peace process will significantly impact Jordan’s demographic, economic, and political stability. By integrating Jordan more actively into the peace process, the U.S. can facilitate a more comprehensive approach that benefits all parties—Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and the broader region.

#### **Conclusion**

Jordan’s historical role, demographic realities, and geopolitical importance make it an indispensable player in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The U.S. should actively encourage and support Jordan’s leadership, leveraging its unique position to foster dialogue and stability. A collaborative approach involving Jordan could pave the way for a more harmonious and sustainable resolution to one of the most enduring conflicts in modern history.

**HeadOn Op-Ed: Conflict Resolution**  
**Isabella McKee**

From coffee houses centuries ago, to modern online platforms like Twitter and Facebook, political conversations have been a key aspect of societal development. Although these conversations have been going on for millennia, they have changed how we approach and mitigate them. There is no doubt that throughout history extremist rhetoric that insights violence has plagued our political conversations, but with the birth of the Internet and social media platforms, this is wildly accessible and poses a significant threat due to the gravity of words hold over cyberspace. As we traverse through a new political landscape, we must set a standard for mediation for our political conversations in order to gain the most out of them, as we typically engage in these in order to share information, construct influential arguments, and further develop our political understanding as a whole. Certain traits must be incorporated into the mediation of these conversations in order to achieve these objectives. This includes, but is not limited to: providing an appropriate setting, establishing clear expectations, and implementing an efficient fact-checking system.  
Providing a safe and moderated space for political conversations is the foundation for progress in this landscape, as the opposite can lead to disruptive and polarizing discourse that fails to achieve the objectives stated above. A study on workplace political discourse found that ambient conversation negatively impacted employees' performance and morale as the unfiltered and unmediated conversations led to a further divide amongst employees and discouraged them from productivity (Rosen, et. al). Along with an established setting, expectations should be effectively communicated to all those involved at the beginning of the conversation, encouraging participants to remain respectful, objective, and factual, with any violation of these leading to intervention by the organizers. This is also supported by a fact-checking system that organizers can provide to eliminate false information and biases that often infiltrate these conversations.  
When specifically talking about the conflict experienced in Israel and Palestine, these values are of the utmost importance because this issue is a crossroads between religion, ethnicity, history, and politics. Topics like religion and ethnicity are often hotbeds for biased discourse that can be difficult to understand from an outside perspective. For example, in a Discord room focusing on the unique relationship between the United States and Israel, history and politics should be at the forefront of this discussion; however, due to the general nature of the topic, it is easy for other factors to influence biases in information. The setting provided for this conversation was efficient in its select number of people (6) and the guiding questions that left room for nuance while remaining neutral. By setting the expectation of remaining on the specific topic of history and politics, the conversation is more likely to stay on track rather than disintegrate into subjective arguments outside of the scope of the topic. By providing a specific setting and expectations, the objectives we wish to achieve are clear and more obtainable by participants. Along with this, encouraging respondents to directly cite their sources adds legitimacy and substance to the conversation. Personally, when citing my book “The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy” in conversation, I felt my points about biases favoring the State of Israel in Congress were better received as there was no need for deliberation on sources, which can often derail political conversations from their main objectives. Although a third-party or automated fact-checking system is most desirable, in unmediated conversations, participants are encouraged to fact-check claims by their peers respectfully and constructively with the appropriate citations. This instills a level of accountability amongst all participants and discourages others from incorporating ill-informed or incorrect information that muddles the overall conversation.  
It is to be understood that internal bias directly influences the manner in which we think, but providing a setting that respectfully sets standards of objectivity can lead to a more productive level of discourse that works to eliminate the negative aspects are often sidetrack these conversations. By prioritizing clear, factual, and respectful discourse, informing others becomes easier and prompts those to evaluate their own biases in developing arguments, which in turn deepens our collective societal understanding in the face of a stormy political climate.
