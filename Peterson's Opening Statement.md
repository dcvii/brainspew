**"Against Tribalism"**

Here’s a cleaned-up version of Peterson’s statement. I’ve preserved his flow and argument but removed fillers, repetitions, and verbal tics, while tightening phrasing for clarity:

---

We should first decide what we’re talking about. This debate is not about my personal views on political correctness, despite what you might have inferred from the previous speaker.

As I see it, human beings require a unifying narrative—a “low-resolution grand narrative”—because without one, peace and cooperation are impossible. Right now, both in universities and in society more broadly, we’re witnessing a clash between two such narratives. Neither is complete, since no single story can capture every detail, but each sets the stage for how we think about the world.

In the West, we’ve built reasonably functional, productive, and free societies with stable hierarchies. These hierarchies are not perfect—they generate dispossessed individuals, and they can slide toward corruption—but they have historically been open to reform. In my view, the relative success of the West stems from its core narrative: **the sovereignty of the individual**. That principle assumes the best way to engage with others is person to person, not group to group. It grants individuals both rights and responsibilities, and it provides the psychological and social foundation for correcting what remains unjust or disorganized in our societies.

The alternative narrative, now dominant in many universities and spreading into the corporate world, is a collectivist one. It blends elements of postmodernism and neo-Marxism and asserts that people are best understood **not as individuals but as members of groups**—whether defined by race, sex, class, or other categories. It further claims that history is nothing more than a **battleground between groups defined by power**.

This collectivist view sidelines the individual at a fundamental level. It also undermines concepts like free speech. In the individualist framework, free speech is the mechanism by which we make sense of the world and improve society. But in the collectivist framework, speech is reduced to a power maneuver on behalf of one’s group. In that formulation, free speech does not exist.

It is widely taught now that Western civilization should be seen primarily as an oppressive patriarchy and that relations between men and women throughout history are best understood as domination of women by men. But this ignores the complexity of hierarchies. Yes, hierarchies tend toward tyranny, but they also serve necessary functions, and we’ve developed mechanisms to keep them in check. Those mechanisms, though imperfect, have worked better than any others in human history.

This is not a debate about whether empathy is valuable or whether those on my side of the argument are unfeeling. I recognize, as does Mr. Fry, that hierarchies often leave people at the bottom, and the left plays a necessary role in giving voice to them. But that is different from adopting a grand narrative that reduces all of us to group identities and interprets history as nothing more than a cycle of oppression and domination. If we take that path, we will not achieve progress. Instead, we will regress into tribalism—the very thing Western individualism has, to a remarkable degree, allowed us to transcend.
