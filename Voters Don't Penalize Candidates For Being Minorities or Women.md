Do political candidates like Kamala Harris, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton perform worse than they otherwise would because of discrimination? Maybe, but they might also do _better_ thanks to discrimination in their favor.

Thankfully, we have two recent meta-analyses of experiments that suggest an answer.

### The Studies

The studies included in these meta-analyses are based on conjoint, factorial, or vignette survey designs. In these studies, researchers present participants with information about candidates and ask them to evaluate them, to make voting decisions, and so on. For example, in a conjoint study, participants might be introduced to different candidates with traits like race, political experience, education, and various policy positions outlined, and then they might be asked to pick which among different sets of candidates they prefer. Over enough runs, you can estimate the impact of race net of other candidate characteristics.

### The Results

If you stack up the meta-analytic results[1](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/voters-dont-penalize-candidates-for?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1163860&post_id=147463935&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-1-147463935) for [sex](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/716290) and [race](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41269-022-00279-y), you get this result:

Voters significantly favor women, marginally significantly favor Asians over Whites, and nonsignificantly favor Blacks over Whites, while having no feelings either way about Hispanics. In other words, if there’s racism or sexism at play, it doesn’t favor Whites or men.

Now, are there people who discriminate? Yes. At a minimum, people discriminate in favor of their own race and sex:

You’ll notice that, compared to the other plot, these impacts tend to be _much_ larger: Hispanics favor Hispanics, Blacks _really_ favor Blacks, Asians favor Asians strongly, etc. The racial concordance bias is so large that you probably can’t even notice that that women’s bias in favor of women is 67% larger than the general population bias in favor of women.

Splits between ingroup favoritism and general population effects imply that either some groups disfavor target groups, or they at least have smaller beneficial effects.

In the case of Whites, it’s unlikely they’re meaningfully biased against members of other races. It’s very rare to actually document that Whites have preferences, but it’s common to document that other groups do. Whites just aren’t very ‘pro-White’ like Blacks are ‘pro-Black’, Asians are ‘pro-Asian’, women are ‘pro-Women’, etc. There are studies on this ranging from [survey experiments](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/2053168017753862) to [thermometer ratings and racial media preference studies](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1771240973730824432), and estimates of [each race’s isolated negative feelings for other races](https://web.archive.org/web/20200829010823/https://www.ljzigerell.com/?p=7480). There just usually isn’t much there, and bias _from Whites_ typically _favors_ groups like Blacks and Hispanics.

In the case of men, we have data! From the same meta-analysis the other sex results came from, men were marginally significantly biased in favor of women, by a smaller amount than the female same-sex bias (+0.9 percentage points, _p_ = 0.072). There’s not much here, and if there’s anything, it probably favors women.

Finally, _intersectionality?_ There aren’t many studies investigating diverse combinations of candidate sex and race, but we do have some. In the sex meta-analysis, there were results for Black and White candidates and they showed consistent bias in favor of women, albeit of +0.9% (_p_ = 0.02) for Black candidates and +2.2% (_p_ = 0.002) for White candidates. Since interactions are rare, hard to find, and we should expect these biases to at least be directionally consistent, none of this speaks in favor of the angle that candidates like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Kamala Harris have suffered worse electoral performance due to their backgrounds.

### This Could Matter More Than It Seems

There are a few reasons why these effects might matter more than they appear to.

One reason this could matter is that these effects are not very small in absolute terms. An advantage of two percentage points can _easily_ make or break a presidential candidate, and an advantage of 0.75 percentage points is still very sizable in recent U.S. presidential elections. For the 2024 election, this bias probably reduces the Republicans’ electoral college-derived advantage and helps the Democrats.

Another reason this could matter is geography. If there are demographic subgroups that disfavor a candidate by some significant amount due to their background and they’re more common in geographically key areas, their impact could be magnified by the electoral college. Because of the general directional consistency of biases across major groups, it’s unlikely this is really a thing to be concerned about though.

Another problem is that maybe these studies’ design is bad, and maybe out side of candidate vignettes, people behaviorally express large preferences. Since people tend to have more extreme survey responses than behavioral ones, this seems unlikely, but we cannot assess it because there aren’t enough elections out there for us to model the impacts of different combinations of candidate characteristics, and candidates’ non-demographic traits aren’t random with respect to their other traits in the real world, so this would be unwise to do in any case.

Maybe some unseen comparisons really matter, like Asians vs. Blacks, or men vs. transmen. While the answer could be _maybe_ for some elections, that’s not a concern for the current presidential election.

Overall, while biases against or in favor of candidates by identity _might_ matter more than these studies suggest, it seems unlikely. That’s why….

### This Probably Matters Less Than It Seems

Candidates in the real world are not matched in terms of different characteristics that race and sex are varied on top of in vignette studies. Their policy prescriptions, appearances, ages, educational achievements, military backgrounds, public experience, wealth, and so on are not able to be altered in a void, and those things probably overpower the impacts of candidate demographics, whatever they are. Those things probably overwhelm demographic effects by _huge_ amounts. We know this because what we ought to think the studies of demographic impacts really reveal is that people don’t tend to care all that much. The reason for this has to do with the tendency of survey results to be exaggerated relative to well-measured real-world effects. As with other areas’ survey-to-real world effect generalization, we should thus shrink them _a lot_ for realism.

In the current election, the person to consider is Trump. He’s not female and he’s White, whereas people’s preferences tend to run the other direction in both cases. But, while many people are willing to claim Harris’ odds are worse due to her demographic background, how many would now be willing to claim Trump is looking at a losing election due to his? Given these results, I suppose our prior should be that it’s on the table.
