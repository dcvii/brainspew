Why are so many young people today turning to socialism?

By *socialism* I mean an economic system where the government nationalizes the means of production—if not in all industries, at least in some critical ones. But as we shall see, many of those attracted to socialism these days may be more attached to negative vibes about the status quo than any particular economic system.

This is most evident in the recent New York City electoral results of Zohran Mamdani, who did very well in the Democratic primary for mayor and is polling well ahead of sitting mayor Eric Adams and former governor Andrew Cuomo. Among other things, Mamdani [has called for](https://www.thefp.com/p/socialist-mayor-new-york-zohran-mamdani) government-run grocery stores, rent freezes, and free buses.

These pronouncements have not created a scandal with his supporters; indeed, they have occasioned tremendous enthusiasm.

I understand why such proposals might thrill some New Yorkers—especially struggling young people. But as an economist I know there is long-standing research showing, for example, that rent freezes lead to apartment shortages and also to quality collapses and deteriorating neighborhoods. Ultimately, it hurts the working class. I also know that the government does not have the flexibility or the profit incentives to do a good job running our grocery stores. They probably would lose money trying, forcing taxpayers to make up the difference. And even the Soviet Union did not wish to experiment with completely free bus rides. Usually service quality is higher when the users have to pay something, thereby boosting the incentives to take their desires seriously.

Such ideas aren’t just spreading in New York. Polling shows that socialist sympathies are widespread. In [one survey](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-some-poll-results-sho-tt.YWc4CQsOgriZ6NaDWDQ), 62 percent of American young people had a positive opinion of socialism, and 34 percent had a positive view of communism. Meantime, only [46 percent](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-percent-of-current-americ-2FQt8UVVTDWkrD1bW0BeAg) have a positive impression of big business, lower than that of previous generations.

The Gen Zer Making Capitalism Cool Again

](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-gen-z-influencer-making-capitalism)

---

It is a long-standing task of social scientists—perhaps the most tireless one—to try to explain the popularity of socialism. Economics Nobel laureate [Friedrich A. Hayek](https://mises.org/profile/friedrich-hayek) attributed it to mankind’s atavistic instincts, left over from earlier, poorer societies when extreme sharing was necessary. [Milton Friedman](https://www.britannica.com/money/Milton-Friedman) treated the socialists as though they were well-intentioned individuals who simply had not learned enough good economics. [Joseph Schumpeter](https://www.britannica.com/money/Joseph-Schumpeter) believed it was the curse of capitalism that the intellectuals would turn against it—an idea later seconded by [Robert Nozick](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Nozick).

Peter Thiel, more recently, has blamed student debt and the high cost of buying a home. “When one has too much student debt or if housing is too unaffordable, then one will have negative capital for a long time,” [he said](https://x.com/anammostarac/status/1937904029012816357). “And if one has no stake in the capitalist system, then one may well turn against it.” As usual, Peter has a point.

There is truth in all of these hypotheses (and there are others yet), but focusing on 2025, I have a more concrete and perhaps more depressing explanation. Socialism is surging right now because American society has simply turned more negative. We complain more, we whine more, and we are more likely to dislike each other. And if we are more negative, that means we are more negative about everything around us—including capitalism. Big business has never been bigger, and we have never spent more time with it, whether it is scrolling on our smartphones, calling up an Uber, or flying to another city.

Consider the kinds of socialist doctrine we see in the public sphere today. The core message is negative, and much of the hostility is directed toward billionaires, even though the wealthiest of them typically have been fantastically productive innovators. Zohran Mamdani says that billionaires should not exist. It is more about tearing down the rich than raising up the poor.

What began with the [Bernie Bros and the so-called dirtbag left](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/9/21168312/bernie-bros-bernie-sanders-chapo-trap-house-dirtbag-left) that, in much the manner of Trump, reveled in dismantling the guardrails of civilized conversation, has now become normal behavior among many socialist influencers. One of the most prominent is [Hasan Piker](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-handsome-face-of-terror-apologia). To choose just one of countless examples, the Twitch star spoke about an American war hero [in this way](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/tyt-host-hasan-piker-mocks-dan-crenshaws-war-injury-brave-fcking-soldier-fcked-his-eye-hole/): “What the fuck is wrong with this dude? Didn’t he go to war and like, literally lose his eye because some mujahideen, a brave fucking soldier, fucked his eye hole with their dick?” He suggested that the brave soldier “deserved” his fate. And he stated, [on several occasions](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/hasan-piker-twitch-profile.html), that [America deserved 9/11](https://kotaku.com/twitch-suspends-popular-leftist-streamer-after-controve-1837518859).

Piker is a passionate socialist and supporter, among others, of Zohran Mamdani.

Even the Soviet Union did not wish to experiment with completely free bus rides.

Perhaps you’ll say: What do his appalling views on America have to do with his economic outlook? Well, they are both the result of an unrelenting negativity, carping spirit, and lack of appreciation for achievement and greatness.

Even staunch Democratic Party supporters such as [Matt Yglesias](https://www.slowboring.com/p/why-are-young-liberals-so-depressed) and [Noah Smith](https://x.com/Noahpinion/status/1830090843929334211) have wondered whether parts of the progressive left might be explained in part by feelings of depression and also too high a desire to feel outrage. [Matt even wrote](https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1765709763294155092), “More evidence of the increasingly porous boundaries between mental illness and left-wing politics.”

Another target of rising dislike is Republicans, especially of the MAGA sort. According to [one poll](https://politicalwire.com/2019/02/21/many-unhappy-if-child-married-someone-of-different-party/), 45 percent of Democrats say they would be unhappy if their child were to marry a Republican. That kind of polarization was [once much weaker](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8266382/).

There is also good evidence that social media has taken on a stronger negative emotional valence over time. Researchers [found that](https://socialeconomicslab.org/research/working-papers/emotions-and-policy/) from 2013 to 2024 in social media, there has been “a sharp rise in negative emotions, particularly anger.” Of course your anger will make other people angrier too, and that will make you angry at a relatively capitalist status quo. You will feel like a socialist, even if you have never thought through the option of running America’s retail shopping malls from Washington, D.C. (An unwise idea, to be sure, yet definitely a socialist one). Socialism has ceased to be a comparative doctrine (hint: it will lose), and rather has evolved into a stand-in for very negative feelings about the status quo and the operation of capitalism.

I have a core theory that ties together these developments. I call it negative emotional contagion. It’s simple: If other people in society become grumpier, we are more likely to become grumpy too. If someone insults us, we are more likely to insult them back. If someone tries to cancel us out of a job and livelihood, we are more likely to retaliate. And so on.

We see evidence for this kind of symmetric behavior every day, most of all online. But the implications of this dynamic are rarely thought through.

When psychological contagion is present, social trends can spread quickly, and they also can spread far and wide. If the mood in society becomes more negative, a small initial change in negativity can lead to much larger longer-run boosts in bad feelings.

How the Yuppies Became Socialists

](https://www.thefp.com/p/yuppies-socialists-zohran-mamdani)

You can see this right in front of your eyes. Think about what happens when a stadium crowd starts booing an athlete, or if a comic bombs in a nightclub.

Such processes operate at the macro level as well, and that, in essence, means that our societies are vulnerable to mood swings. Many people, such as [Jonathan Haidt](https://www.thefp.com/w/jonathan-haidt), attribute this negative social contagion to social media. But such negative emotional contagion is a well-established social phenomenon—long before smartphones and Facebook.

In the years leading up to World War I, for instance, European diplomacy became more tense. European societies felt more alienated, as author Philipp Blom has referred to *[The Vertigo Years](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780465020294)* in his book of the same title. Music became more dissonant, and art became more fractured and less representational. Traditional beauty was no longer such an ideal, and atonal music was in the ascendancy.

One can debate the initial causes of such developments, but the relevant point is once they got started, they acquired a momentum of their own. And so a relatively wealthy and peaceful European society moved from its golden age of the mid- to late-19th century to rising tensions and, eventually, horrific bloodshed. That isn’t to say there were not some tremendously evil actors on the scene. But it was negative social contagion at its worst, as the philosophies of fascism and Nazism put human beings at each others’ throats, that led to World War II.

In contrast, consider the American Revolution as having led to a lot of positive social contagion. The successful liberation of the colonies from Britain sparked interest in liberty-oriented rebellions in France, Switzerland, and in the Caribbean—and later, Latin America too. Historian Robert Palmer once wrote a book called *[The Age of the Democratic Revolution](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780691161280)*, arguing that each of these revolutions helped to encourage and spur the next one.

Such mood swings have always been with us, but these days they seem to be especially virulent. Perhaps bad events are to blame for the initial uptick in negative feelings. In 2001, hijackers flew planes into the Twin Towers—a previously unimaginable event for most Americans. The United States was taken down a peg. The second Iraq War then failed. The Great Recession came in 2008, followed by a slow labor market bounce-back. Covid and its aftermath were the next nightmare. Should it be such a huge surprise if the negative feelings have dug in and stuck?

One offshoot of all these negative feelings has been a very dark, pessimistic socialism.

The 19th century had a good deal of what is called “[utopian socialism](https://www.britannica.com/money/utopian-socialism),” which stressed how wonderful everything would become, at least after the government nationalized the assets. It was more about creating an age of plenty than hating the wealthy fat cats. The French socialist Charles Fourier [wrote of](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/the-french-socialist-charles-f-2VpWMTvyRlqbt_1.rAB8Dg) free sex, oceans full of lemonade, and ships pulled by dolphins.

Even the Soviet Union had some positive and forward-looking elements to its socialist doctrine. The stated goal was to overtake the United States, not “degrowth.” You were supposed to have kids to support the glory of communism, not give up on the idea because the world was too dreadful. Socialist labor was supposed to be fun and rewarding, not something to whine about. Furthermore, there were top performers in every category, including in the schools. [Moscow State University](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Moscow-State-University) was a self-consciously elite institution that intended to remain as such. However skewed the standards may have been, there was an intense desire to measure the best and (sometimes) reward them with foreign travel, as in chess and pianism. In an often distorted and unfair way, some parts of the Soviet system respected the notion of progress. For all the horrors of Soviet communism, at least along a few dimensions it had better ideals than some of those from today, including the undesirability of having children, and a dislike of economic growth.

If other people in society become grumpier, we are more likely to become grumpy too.

One strength of the “negative contagion” explanation for socialist loyalties is that it helps to explain movements on the other side of the political spectrum as well, namely the right wing.

It’s not just the far left that’s going negative, it’s the right, too. Earlier versions of right-wing views, such as Reagan’s conservatism or social conservatism, thought in terms of America as a [shining city on a hill](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/election-eve-address-vision-america). The libertarians also had a fundamentally positive worldview of how individuals were capable of enjoying liberty and turning it toward broader social benefit.

These days an attitude of confrontation has replaced those visions. “Owning the libs” is now a priority. Belief in conspiracies is much more common, and antisemitism runs rampant. A mean streak is increasingly on public display, including from the president and his vice president. They are resurrecting many earlier socialist ideals, such as the notion that business should be subservient to government leaders, and that more and more of the economy should be managed through industrial policy.

It’s striking how much the current “negativist” right wing has taken from the earlier, pessimistic side of the left. Some strands of the earlier left were quite positive and constructive, such as the emphasis on free speech and gay rights. But the earlier left also had a more negative and pessimistic side. It showed up in the form of tariff advocacy, food and biomedical conspiracy theories, anti-Fed sentiment, dislike of globalization, and the wish to pull back America from its central role in guaranteeing liberties around the world. Those strands have not disappeared in American thought; rather they have come back with a vengeance in the new, pessimistic political right.

There is plenty of evidence that Generation Z [leans to the right](https://katiecouric.com/news/politics-and-policy/gen-z-men-conservative-religion/), especially the younger boys. They are more right wing than millennials, for instance. You might think that refutes the hypothesis of a trend toward socialism, but sadly, it does not. We are getting both negative trends at the same time, at the expense of the middle. It is a single unified trend, but with two distinct branches, each observing and citing the other, in a manner designed to support its own critical attitudes. After all, the other side really is that terrible.

Once societies get caught in this trap of dark moods and views it is hard for them to get out of the box, even though the United States has historically high living standards and also falling crime rates, as Clifford S. Asness and Michael R. Strain argued in [this essay](https://www.thefp.com/p/populists-ignore-reality-we-live-in-best-world-ever) recently published in *The Free Press*.

If you would like some more good news, it is that societies can escape from this trap of back and forth nastiness. They have in the past, such as when Europe rebuilt from the horrors of World War II; when America bounced back from the Civil War; and now, as present-day Poland puts its socialist past behind it to become a highly successful and happy nation. But large numbers of people have to put on more positive attitudes, and indeed back it up with their actions.

So have a nice day! And act to make it true. The stakes for the country have never been higher.
