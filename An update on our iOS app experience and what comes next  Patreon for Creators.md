An update on our iOS app experience and what comes next

4 hours ago

The [recent U.S. court ruling in Epic v. Apple](https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control) made it possible for apps to sell memberships outside of Apple's in-app purchase system, which has already led to a [wave of app updates](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/technology/iphone-app-store-changes.html). The impact of this ruling is a huge win for creators, fans, and Patreon because we can now update our iOS app with a checkout experience that gives U.S. based fans the option to bypass Apple’s in-app purchase system, which takes a 30% fee. This means more control over earnings for creators when they sell their memberships through the iOS app in the U.S. – which remains the place where Patreon sees the highest levels of fan engagement and new membership signups.

While the court ruling brings positive changes—more flexible checkout options, lower fees, and faster payouts—it’s an evolving situation. We [promised to keep you updated frequently](https://www.patreon.com/posts/u-s-court-rules-128009451), and we’re sharing what we know now.

### A big win for subscription billing creators: Patreon’s iOS app update is live

Following the ruling, we rolled out an iOS app update with an alternative checkout option for U.S. fans—which was approved by Apple and is now live for creators using subscription billing, who represent 95% of all creators on Patreon.

**Here's what this means:**

- Patreon’s checkout option—which avoids Apple’s 30% fee—is now **the default checkout option** for U.S. based fans making membership purchases in the iOS app.
- Your U.S. fans now see **the price you set** without Apple’s fee automatically added in, just like they would on web or Android.
- When your U.S. fans use Patreon’s checkout, you’ll have **faster payouts**, because you are no longer subject to [Apple’s 75 day hold](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913499-Paying-out-your-earnings) on payouts.

**Here’s what you need to do:**

Nothing— once your U.S. fans have [the latest version](http://patreon.com/mobile) of the Patreon app, these updates will take effect automatically.

### Another big win for legacy billing creators: iOS payments are coming back and we can offer more flexibility in your switch to subscription billing

![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/128473586/6a9814b80ea249f193103af1346cbd60/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=Pkwfu1s3YF9bNXx_VUq2PzRX0EFIO2hjcTnnHIewLb0%3D&token-time=1748563200)

This week, Apple approved a new version of the Patreon app, which means the 5% of creators on legacy billing models (first-of-the-month and per creation) will be able to earn from their U.S. fans through the iOS app again. Until now, this wasn’t possible because Apple didn’t support these billing models and required the exclusive use of their own purchase system. Restoring purchase options on iOS for this group of creators will make a real impact. You should start seeing this in the app within the week.

**Here’s what this means for creators on legacy billing models:**

- Soon, your U.S. fans will be able to purchase memberships again at the price you’ve set for your tiers through the iOS app.
- You still need to be on subscription billing to sell new memberships in the iOS app to fans outside of the U.S.
- With approximately **95% of active Patreon creators on subscription billing**, our continued focus is to make it the strongest and most flexible billing option for creators’ businesses. Switching to subscription billing still unlocks access to powerful growth tools like [free trials](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/11044183172493-Free-Trials-FAQ), [Autopilot](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/28030768415629-Automate-your-growth-with-Autopilot), [discounts](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/27479665547917-Managing-discounts), [gifting](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/31345065123597-Gifting-memberships-to-your-fans-creator-to-fan-gifts) and [tier repricing](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027992451-Best-practices-for-increasing-your-tier-prices).
- Now with the added flexibility to offer the same web checkout flow on iOS, we are actively working to resolve issues that have blocked the remaining 5% of Patreon creators who have not yet switched to subscription billing.

### The November 2025 subscription billing deadline is no longer in effect

Last year, [we let you know](https://news.patreon.com/articles/understanding-apple-requirements-for-patreon) that all creators would need to switch to subscription billing by November 2025. This forced deadline wasn’t something we chose — it was the result of needing to comply with Apple’s requirements at the time or risk the removal of Patreon’s app from the App Store. While we’ve long believed subscription billing is the strongest long-term model for creators, forced compliance with Apple’s mandates and deadlines was obviously not how we ever wanted to roll out changes to creators on Patreon. That being said, the legacy models come with challenges for Patreon and continued uncertainty on the Apple side – including the long term outlook for international fans and what may happen on Apple’s appeal of the ruling.

We’ve stayed in close conversation with Apple and have continued advocating for a more flexible approach — one that gives creators more time and choice. As a result of the recent ruling and changes on Apple's end, **the November 2025 deadline is no longer in effect,** and as of today, no new deadline has been set. This means that, as of now, we can give creators more time and flexibility in when and how they switch while we simultaneously work to resolve issues that have blocked them from switching in the first place.

Over the past year, we’ve operated under the clear understanding that staying in compliance with Apple’s rules was necessary. Their requirements have shifted significantly as they work to comply with—while still appealing – the court decision. If a new subscription billing requirement deadline is introduced, we’ll provide as much notice as possible before anything changes. You are running your businesses on Patreon and many of you rely on us to keep your livelihoods stable. We owe you strong partnership in return.

### What’s next

Our priority is to help as many creators as possible grow their earnings and build thriving communities, on their terms. Based on Apple’s latest feedback to us, our next step is to move Patreon’s alternative checkout within the iOS app to open in an external browser. While it’s more steps for fans, it still allows us to offer a checkout option that avoids Apple’s 30% fee–a win we’re committed to preserving.

Despite all of this uncertainty, **the court decision is still a win**. While Apple has already appealed the ruling, we’re moving quickly, advocating for creators, and working hard to build a better path forward—while staying committed to being transparent with you along the way.

Thank you for your patience and trust. We’ll continue to advocate for your ability to own your creative business and we’ll be back soon with more updates.
