Commenter “Mrs Whatsit” has made [this thoughtful observation](https://thenewneo.com/2025/07/11/forgetting-what-doesnt-fit-your-preferred-narrative/#comment-2811060):

> I used to wonder how on earth the “good Germans” allowed Hitler to happen. I’m afraid that now I see, as it’s happening around me among many people who sincerely think of themselves as good and yet are blindly, enthusiastically cooperating with evil.
> 
> I’ve been reading Douglas Murray’s extraordinary new book, “On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilization.” It’s painful to read, but illuminating as to how so many meaning-to-be-good people — including too many of my friends and relatives — have let their prior certainties lead them into this abyss of hatred and upside-down thinking. I’m losing sleep over it.

Yes, but for me the analogy isn’t so much to the Germans and Hitler, but rather to the Orwellian upside-down world of *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and its inversion of the truth. The details are quite different in both analogies, but the common denominator is how chilling it is to see how easily people can be made to believe lies, and how those lies become entrenched, and how that leads to demonizing the Other – including the widespread idea on the left that it’s the pro-Trump *right* who are the *real* Nazis.

Sobering.

After Trump’s 2024 victory, a friend who had stuck with me as a friend through many decades of “agree-to-disagree” politics stopped talking to me and explained that she can no longer talk to people who support Trump. Also after his election, another old friend told me, only slightly jokingly, that if she had a terminal medical diagnosis she would purchase a gun and make plans to assassinate him and consider it well worth it to suffer the consequences.

This latter person is someone I grew up with and have been at least somewhat friendly with all these years, but I probably only speak to her (on the phone; she lives far away) about once a year. I seem to recall that the prior time we mentioned politics – maybe ten years ago? – she was fairly moderate and not enamored of the Democratic Party. Apparently, something about Trump had subsequently pushed her over the brink into raw hatred – although she knew I support him and was perfectly happy to talk to me. During the recent conversation, I asked her what made her hate Trump so very much, and she cited his Charlottesville remarks – which tells you how important propaganda is in shaping such deep antipathy. She seemed to think that the incident proved he was a Nazi, or Nazi sympathizer and enabler. Even though I informed her that his Charlottesville remarks had been twisted and distorted by the press and the left, she wasn’t particularly interested in hearing details or softening her point of view.

But back to the actual history of the actual Nazis. Germany in the 1920s and 1930s had really been through the mill. First there was their huge losses in the First World War plus the Versailles Treaty, and then their economic hardship during the Weimar years. I don’t think our recent history compares. Not only that, but I think it’s important to remember that although the “good Germans” did indeed allow Hitler to happen, they didn’t actually elect him. Yes, there were plenty of Nazis, but not a majority of Germans when he was appointed in the proverbial “backroom deal.”

But perhaps even more importantly, the Nazis imprisoned and/or even murdered a great many of the “good Germans,” as soon as the Nazis got to power, and then used a great many approaches to make it very very difficult and very frightening to oppose them. They consolidated their power very quickly with the Enabling Act (it was passed about seven weeks after Hitler’s ascension), something that has not happened here and hopefully never will.

Until I became especially interested in how the Nazis came to power, I really didn’t know the extreme nature of what they did quite early on in their rule, but I’ve written about it on this blog in the following posts: [this one](https://thenewneo.com/2010/03/24/unhappy-historic-anniversary-yesterday-the-enabling-act-of-1933/) on the passage of the Enabling Act, and [this one](https://thenewneo.com/2015/01/17/i-think-i-need-to-read-these-books-on-nazi-germany/) on the speed and violence of their actions to make sure everyone who might even think of opposing them was terrified, except for the exceptionally courageous.

The book I describe in the latter post – [*The Nazi Seizure of Power*](https://amzn.to/40NnnC5) – is especially edifying and I recommend it highly. It describes step by step how it was done, and why resistance was futile. If you read the book, you’ll see that, for example, although our own J6 prosecutions were akin to some of these actions, the crackdown on the J6-ers and on the right in general during the Biden years was far milder than what the Nazis did to their own opponents. The book describes how this was accomplished in the first six months of the Nazi regime:

> Very early in the Nazi era an event occurred in Thalburg \[the fictitious name of the actual German city that was the subject of the book\] which effectively fused propaganda and terror. This was the boycott of the Jews, April 1 to 4, 1933. … \[T\]his particular action was also a miniature example of what the Nazis intended to do to the entire German population. For the essential effect of the boycott of the Jews was to atomize them socially: to cut them off from the rest of German society so that normal human ties could not work to restrain the dictatorship. …
> 
> Thus the position of the Jews in Thalburg was rapidly clarified, certainly by the end of the first half-year of Hitler’s regime. …
> 
> Thalburg’s Jews were simply excluded from the community at large. At the same time the Nazis undertook their most Herculean task: the atomization of the community at large. Though the methods differed, the result was the same, and by the summer of 1033 individual Thalburgers were as effectively cut off from effective intercourse with each other as the Jews had been from the rest of the townspeople. …Eventually no independent social groups were to exist. Ultimately all society, in terms of human relationships, would cease to exist, or rather would exist in a new framework whereby each individual related not to his fellow men but only to the state and to the Nazi leader \[Hitler\] who became the personal embodiment of the state. …
> 
> Most of this was accomplished in the first few months of the Nazi era. Clubs were dissolved; others were fused together; others lost their purpose and went into rapid decline. All societies came under Nazi control …
> 
> … \[By this process\] individuals had a choice: solitude or mass relationship via some Nazi organization.

There’s so much else in the book that I can only recommend reading the entire thing, because it gives a highly detailed and comprehensive step-by-step picture of that era. And although there are some similarities – after all, clubs have been on the wane in the US for quite some time – what’s happened here is neither as fast nor as organized and *totalitarian* in every sense of the word.

For that, we can be thankful that we don’t have the Germanic tendency towards efficiency or obedience. COVID lockdowns showed that we have more of a tendency towards obedience than most of us had previously thought – and yet it was by no means a universal response, and many states regained their freedoms relatively early in the game. Consider it a warning.
