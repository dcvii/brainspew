To celebrate NPR losing federal funds, you just KNOW we had to compile some of their worst articles from over the years.  
  
Get ready to lose some brain cells. üßµ

Hunter Biden‚Äôs Laptop Is A ‚ÄúPure Distraction‚Äù  
  
NPR decided not to cover the scandal at all: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories."  
  
In 2022, they quietly admitted that it might have actually been worth paying attention to, after all.  
  
Shocker.

Consider The ‚ÄúGay Asylum-Seekers‚Äù  
  
One story NPR did find worth covering was this 2021 piece ‚¨áÔ∏è  
  
You can also read about gay Muslims living in Russia, gay refugees fleeing Ukraine, gay refugees from Uganda...  
  
And that‚Äôs not even half of their gay immigrant coverage üôÉ

Everything Is Racist. Even Eating Healthy.  
  
In 2020, NPR ran an interview titled ‚ÄúFat Phobia And Its Racist Past And Present.‚Äù  
  
The interview went ‚Äúback to the transatlantic slave trade to understand the racial origins of fat phobia.‚Äù  
  
NPR's mental gymnastics must be exhausting.

Have you ever driven past a semi on the interstate and wondered if the driver was transgender?  
  
Well, NPR has.  
  
They talked to a trans-identifying man to learn about the world of ‚Äúwomen" truckers and what ‚Äúthey tell us about about living and working alone.‚Äù

Bugs. That's the tweet.

Transgender Dinosaurs?  
  
NPR once spent 10 minutes describing the battle between pro- and anti-trans activists over the dinosaur emoji.  
  
Even better, they explained the phenomenon between updates about the January 6 hearings.  
  
Stellar journalism, guys.

‚ÄúThis is a dark day,‚Äù Chuck Schumer said in response to the NPR cuts.  
  
Maybe for the transgender dinosaurs, but I think the rest of us will probably be okay.

Whistleblowers say that relief workers were told it was "best practice" to pass over houses "advertising Trump."  
  
The workers would enter into the system that they made no contact with the residents, blaming the directive: "Trump sign, no contact per leadership"

One worker says it wasn't what he signed up for.  
  
"I thought we could go help and make a difference. When we got there we were told to discriminate against people. It‚Äôs almost unbelievable to think that somebody in the federal government would think that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

We have a reporter ([@BlueBoxDave](https://twitter.com/BlueBoxDave)) inside the courtroom at the Ghislaine Maxwell trial. Here are some of the latest notes:

(1/2) Prosecution finished direct on Kate. Met Epstein through Maxwell at 17, at GMs London house. Upon meeting was asked to ‚Äúgive his feet a little squeeze‚Äù to show how strong she was. This led to massage/sex the next time they met, with GM in the house but not in the room.

At Epstein‚Äôs Island Kate found a schoolgirl outfit on her bed. Maxwell told her it would be ‚Äúfun‚Äù if she wore it to bring JE tea by the pool. Sex ensued.
