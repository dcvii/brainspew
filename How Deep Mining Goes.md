In my career as a mining engineer, I have travelled to a depth of about 3.5 kilometers beneath the surface at the Western Deeps (now Mponeng) Mine in South Africa, where a former classmate was the mine manager. The problems of going deeper were obvious. 

We had to descend three separate shafts to reach the face, which took over an hour. Shafts are limited to about 2,500 meters depth because for anything deeper the weight of the wire rope holding the man-carrying cage exceeds the strength of the rope. 

The rock temperature was over 60 degrees C (140 degrees F). The mine pumped thousands of tons of slurried ice down the mine every day in order to maintain the air temperatures at workable levels. 

Such depths are only possible because the rock surrounding the gold reefs is very strong. However the rock is subject to immense stress. Sometimes it breaks explosively in a ‘rockburst’. A month earlier a rockburst had killed three miners. 

Going 16 miles (25) kilometers with a decline massively multiplies the problems. At that depth the rock surrounding the decline will be under a pressure of around 70,000 tons per square meter (95,000 pounds per square inch) seven times the pressure at the bottom of the Challenger deep. No rock is strong enough to maintain an opening at that pressure - and without support the decline will collapse on itself. But how are you going to support the rock at that pressure? The rock will be at a temperature of at least 500 degrees Celsius (950 degrees F) - and ordinary steel softens at 400 degrees C. You could use the steel alloy used in jet turbine blades, but the rhenium used to make enough for even a hundred meters of support far exceeds the annual production of rhenium. 

The temperature is another problem. You will have built a 200 mile long heat exchanger. There is no way you can remove enough heat to keep the temperature at the face suitable for your excavation equipment. 

Decline access is quite common in mining, as it allows the use of trucks for haulage. The deepest mine in the world using access by decline is the Gwalia Mine in Australia. It reaches a depth of 1.66 kilometers (1 mile). It takes two hours for a loaded truck to drive from the bottom to the surface. Driving up a steep incline with a loaded truck is slow. The mine is likely getting towards the limit for depths achievable by declines. A good description of the mine is at At 1.6km underground, Australia's deepest gold mine is getting deeper
