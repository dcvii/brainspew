A few days ago, I walked to the local train station and bought a ticket. I got on a train going south. The train passed several stops. I didn’t get off at any of them. At the final stop, I got off, waited for yet another train, and took that train directly to Jerusalem.

Now, did I deserve to go to Jerusalem?

... It doesn’t really matter, does it? I bought a ticket, boarded the train, and chose not to get off before Jerusalem, so that’s where I ended up. Whether I deserved it or not.

Does Hamas deserve the ongoing destruction in Gaza?

Hamas bought a ticket.

And now they’ve arrived somewhere close to hell on earth.

Do they deserve it? I’d argue that the ones among them who committed torture and murder of innocent people, who continue to hold civilians hostage, or who support those actions, do deserve it.

But mostly, I’d argue that “deserve” doesn’t outvote “chose.” A person who deserves a long happy life is still going to die if they walk in front of a moving train. And a government that deserves good things is still going to face utter ruin if they start a war with a much stronger enemy, and prefer to die rather than make peace.

Something for all of us to keep in mind these days, as we keep trading rockets back and forth like drunken idiots trying to juggle chainsaws.

Maybe we should all spend less time thinking of what we/our enemies deserve, and more time thinking about what would and wouldn’t be a smart choice.
