### New data!

Back in 2018, in her controversial paper on Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD), [Lisa Littman](https://rogd.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pone.0214157.s001.pdf) found that many parents of youth with adolescent onset gender dysphoria claimed that their kids had increased their social media use in recent months or years. There were upfront reasons to be suspicious of this claim…it was based on parents’ *perceptions* of their social media use rather than objective measures, youth often increase media use of all kinds during early adolescence, which is nothing new, and parents historically have a bias in ascribing youth behavior to external factors (rather than themselves) [1](https://grimoiremanor.substack.com/p/the-littmanshrierhaidt-hypothesis#footnote-1-176415776). In most cases parents’ perceptions have proven wrong, such as with violent video games, rock music, Dungeons and Dragons or the radio.

Nonetheless, Littman’s hypothesis lit like wildfire in certain anti-woke circles, despite the paucity of evidence from better data supporting it [2](https://grimoiremanor.substack.com/p/the-littmanshrierhaidt-hypothesis#footnote-2-176415776). It became a central point of Abigail Shrier’s book *Irreversible Damage* [3](https://grimoiremanor.substack.com/p/the-littmanshrierhaidt-hypothesis#footnote-3-176415776), and anti-tech crusader Jonathan Haidt made controversial comments linking girl’s gender identity to social media on [PBS Firing Line in 2024](https://grimoiremanor.substack.com/p/the-social-media-panic-enters-its?utm_source=publication-search), once again despite a lack of evidence to support correlational, let alone causal claims.

To be fair, until recently, there was little evidence one way or another to either support or refute these causal claims. Nonetheless, they achieved a kind of quasi-religious quality among the anti-woke, being repeated (again, without evidence) as part of the NYT’s interview with the leader of the [Cass Report](https://grimoiremanor.substack.com/p/a-review-of-the-nyts-the-protocol?utm_source=publication-search) on youth gender medicine.

Why there have been so few studies is itself an interesting question. After all scholars have done hundreds of studies of social media use and mental health broadly (mostly [not finding](https://www.christopherjferguson.com/Social%20Media%20Meta.pdf) much [evidence](https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440\(24\)08494-9) for correlations). Why not also assess gender identity or trans issues as an outcome? My suspicion is that most scholars were afraid of the social opprobrium they might face should they actually support the Littman/Shrier/Haidt hypothesis. Unfortunately, this left this hypothesis uncontested and, essentially, unfalsifiable.

**The Kaufman Question**

Fortunately, some folks have finally crunched some of this data. This week, Eric Kaufman, Professor of Politics at the University of Buckingham released data looking at trends in youth self-identification as nonbinary or trans. You can read his full description [here](https://x.com/epkaufm/status/1978074268656173305), but the gist of this is that youth self-identification as non-binary is on a precipitous decline. Most interesting for the Littman/Shrier/Haidt hypothesis is that this decline has happened while social media use has remained at all time highs among youth. Kaufman attributes the decline in part to a decline in mental health issues among youth (which has also happened despite social media use remaining at all time highs, another problem particularly for Haidt’s crusade against social media) and a shift in trends (fewer youth cosplaying as non-binary for social clout) [4](https://grimoiremanor.substack.com/p/the-littmanshrierhaidt-hypothesis#footnote-4-176415776). Kaufman specifically noted that social media use does not appear to be related to youth gender self-identification.

These types of time trend analyses are interesting. They’re similar to data that eventually showed that violent crimes decreased even as violent video games soared in popularity. But time trend data can be misleading too, leading to ecological fallacies, such as the strong correlation between the number of Nicholas Cage movies released each year and swimming pool deaths in the US. That the introduction of television seemed to correspond to an increase in violent crime in the 1970s and 80s convinced many that television caused crime, at least until that pattern completely reversed in the 1990s even as television became more graphically violent. Very likely a similar ecological fallacy caused people to falsely correlate increasing social media use during the 2010s to increased gender nonconformity and mental health issues at the same time. Now that both those patterns appear to be reversing, the Littman/Shrier/Haidt hypothesis looks pretty far out on a weak branch.

**A Wrinkle!**

I’d be remiss not to point out that some controversy has emerged over Kaufman’s analysis. I think the most worrisome came from [Jacob Eliason](https://jacobeliason.com/posts/2025-10-14-fire-survey-analysis-correction/) who claimed that Kaufman failed to use the recommended sampling weights for his data, and when the weights were applied a different trend emerged. However, Eliason’s reanalysis produced an improbable pattern. Eliason claims that gender nonconformity remained stable at about 1-2% through 2023, only to suddenly spike to 10% in 2024. As Kaufman [himself](https://erickaufmann.substack.com/p/yes-trans-is-in-decline-among-young) pointed out, that set of results is absurd. Clearly there’s a problem with the weights. I’ve reached out to some statisticians at FIRE, owners of the original data, with some questions and will update when I get a reply. I think there’s a fair argument that we should generally be skeptical of survey-based data, particularly time trends. But I think Kaufman wins the exchange with Eliason, at least until more emerges (which I remain open to).

**Update:** I heard back from Sean Stevens, Chief Research Advisor at FIRE. He said: “I think there are arguments to be made on both sides of the issue, so while we’d recommend applying them, Kaufmann does have good reasons to argue the weights shouldn’t be applied to a population when we aren’t entirely sure what the size of it is (trans or gender non-conforming). I don’t think there is much reason to be concerned about respondents being replaced over time -- they’re college students, we’d expect 20%-25% to cycle out of the sample each year.” So, contrary to some early reporting, FIRE is not taking an anti-Kaufman position (or any strong position, really). Now back to our regularly scheduled programming…

But does data from other sources support the Kaufman’s observations using time trend analysis? By a bit of luck, an adversarial collaboration between myself and social psychologist Scott Semenya at MacEwan University set out to answer some relevant questions. We looked at CDC data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). In two studies we looked at screen time for the Florida YRBSS data from 2019 and 2021 and, in the second study, social media use for the national 2023 data wave for the YRBSS. We wanted to see if there was any association between social media or screen time and youth trans self-identification.

So, what did we find?
