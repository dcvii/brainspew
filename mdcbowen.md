### abstract summary

With a career spanning over two decades at the intersection of advanced analytics, enterprise data systems, and infrastructure optimization, I have demonstrated deep and versatile technical acumen across a remarkable range of technologies, industries, and global enterprises.

My work includes:

- **MPP Database Architecture Modernization** Transformed Vertica clusters (42 nodes, 50TB) at **Guess** into an enterprise-grade platform with proactive monitoring, robust backup and disaster recovery, and optimized performance. Standardized procedures and geographic redundancy enabled scalable, reliable operations, ensuring continuity for critical POS and reporting systems while supporting the company’s global retail footprint.
- **Performance Engineering & Reliability:** At **Teva Pharmaceuticals**, I performed extensive work on AWS hosted Vertica + Tableau infrastructure with cloud-based ETL processes, performance benchmarking, and automated data collection systems. The work spanned multiple domains including database infrastructure, data migration, stream processing, monitoring systems, and performance optimization. At **Toyota**, I addressed Oracle drill-down security, ODS optimization and security-bound network timeouts.
- **Enterprise-Scale Data Integration & Planning:** Delivered near-real-time ETL coordination for multinational operations, such as the 34-database Hyperion Planning suite at **Nissan North America**, spanning five time zones and integrating DB2 UDB, Informatica, and custom shell/Perl automation. At **Cingular Wireless**, I integrated Oracle Financials and OneWorld into a store-level P&L system over Teradata, showcasing advanced dimension modeling and partition maintenance.
- **Custom System Architecture & Migration:** Led high-risk migrations such as a 100+ database move to Hyperion System 9 in **Cleveland**, including external LDAP integration scripting. For **Men’s Wearhouse**, I provided strategic platform assessment and migration architecture across 25+ Essbase systems. At **Hines**, I executed a full system rescue with security and backup rearchitecture.
- **Large-Scale Analytics Prototyping:** Created complex hierarchical inventory models for **Rockwell Rocketdyne** to support the ISS and Space Shuttle programs, and at **Boeing**, I built a global engineering financial model platform for 5000+ concurrent users on 17,000 projects, deploying on HP Superdome with.NET smart client architecture.
- **Advanced API & Systems-Level Development:** Implemented system integration through CORBA and Rhythm Suite for **i2 Technologies**, and built VB API-driven POS reporting for **Hot Topic**. My work has included evaluation of columnar databases and transaction pipelines at **Qantas**, incorporating regulatory metrics for pilot fatigue, GIS waypoints, and fuel consumption.
- **Mastery of Data Modeling & BI Tools:** From reverse-engineering Solomon ERP at **SLC Construction** to architecting 16-dimensional consumer behavior models at **Coca-Cola**, my background includes early adoption and design of star schemas, cross-platform BI front-ends (Excel, Lotus, Palm/Avantgo, Cognos, Tableau, Power BI, QlikView, and Pentaho), and scripting MDX and MAXL-based workflows for inter-cube data routing.

Across all of this, I’ve demonstrated fluency with tools such as **Hyperion, Essbase, OracleDB, Teradata, Vertica, Informatica, DB2, shell, Perl, VB, and Python**, in environments ranging from AWS to HP Superdome, across industries including aerospace, telecom, retail, finance, real estate, and healthcare.
