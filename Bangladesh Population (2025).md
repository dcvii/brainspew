### Notes

The **Bangladesh Population (Live)** counter shows a continuously updated estimate of the current population of Bangladesh delivered by [Worldometer’s RTS algorithm](https://www.worldometers.info/license/what/), which processes data collected from the United Nations Population Division.

The **Population of Bangladesh (1950 - 2025)** chart plots the total population count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2025.

The **Yearly Population Growth Rate** chart plots the annual percentage changes in population registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2025. This value can differ from the *Yearly % Change* shown in the historical table, which shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period.

### Definitions

**Year**: as of July 1 of the year indicated.

**Population**: Overall total population (both sexes and all ages) in the country as of July 1 of the year indicated, as estimated by the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division.
