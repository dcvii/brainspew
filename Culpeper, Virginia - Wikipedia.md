**Culpeper** (formerly *Culpeper Courthouse*, earlier *Fairfax*) is an incorporated town in [Culpeper County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpeper_County,_Virginia "Culpeper County, Virginia"), [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia "Virginia"), United States. It is the county seat and part of the [Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%E2%80%93Baltimore_combined_statistical_area "Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area"). At the 2020 [United States Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census "United States Census"), the population was 20,062, an increase from 16,379 in 2010. Its growth has been influenced by the town's location along [U.S. Route 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_15_in_Virginia "U.S. Route 15 in Virginia"), [U.S. Route 29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_29_in_Virginia "U.S. Route 29 in Virginia"), and [U.S. Route 522](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_522 "U.S. Route 522"), as well as its rail and bus connections and proximity to the [Washington metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area "Washington metropolitan area").[^5]

The town was laid out in 1749 by a young [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington") while working as a surveyor for Lord Fairfax, and formally established in 1759 by the Virginia House of Burgesses under the name Fairfax.[^6] During the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War"), the [Culpeper Minutemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpeper_Minutemen "Culpeper Minutemen") militia organized here in 1775.[^7] In the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"), Culpeper was occupied by both Union and Confederate forces due to its strategic position along the [Orange and Alexandria Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_and_Alexandria_Railroad "Orange and Alexandria Railroad"), and the surrounding county saw engagements including the [Battle of Brandy Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Brandy_Station "Battle of Brandy Station"), the largest cavalry battle of the war.[^8]

In the late 19th and 20th centuries, Culpeper grew as a regional rail and market center. A major cultural landmark is the [Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packard_Campus_for_Audio-Visual_Conservation "Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation"), opened by the [Library of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress") in 1997 on the site of a former Federal Reserve facility.[^9] The town's historic core, including East Davis Street, has been recognized for preservation and revitalization, with the [American Planning Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Planning_Association "American Planning Association") naming it one of "America's Great Places" in 2011.[^10] Culpeper has also been affected by modern events such as the [2011 Virginia earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Virginia_earthquake "2011 Virginia earthquake"), which damaged downtown structures,[^11] and recent technology-related investment, including data centers within the Culpeper Technology Zone.[^12]

## History

After Culpeper County was established in 1748, the [Virginia House of Burgesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Burgesses "Virginia House of Burgesses") voted on February 22, 1759, to create the Town of Fairfax. The name honored [Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fairfax,_6th_Lord_Fairfax_of_Cameron "Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron") (1693–1781),[^13] the proprietor of the [Northern Neck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Neck "Northern Neck") of Virginia, which included a large tract of land between the [Rappahannock River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappahannock_River "Rappahannock River") and the [Potomac River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River").

### Founding

Culpeper Courthouse during the Confederacy, August 1862

The original plan for the town included ten blocks, which form part of the current downtown area. In 1749, the layout was surveyed by a young [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington") while employed by Lord Fairfax.[^14] [^15]

Culpeper County was formed from Orange County by act of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1748, effective May 17, 1749. It initially included what are now Madison and Rappahannock counties in addition to its current area.[^16]

After the county was organized, the Town of Fairfax was authorized in 1759 by the Virginia House of Burgesses as the town seat.[^13] [^17]

The town was commonly known as "Culpeper Court House" to distinguish it from other places called Fairfax. The official name of "Culpeper" was adopted later, in part to resolve confusion.[^17]

During the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War"), the Culpeper Minutemen, a local militia company, organized in 1775 at a location known as "Clayton's Old Field," now the site of Yowell Meadow Park. The unit was part of Virginia's early revolutionary efforts and later participated in engagements such as the Battle of Great Bridge.[^18]

During the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"), Culpeper became a key location due to its position along the [Orange and Alexandria Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_and_Alexandria_Railroad "Orange and Alexandria Railroad") and proximity to major river crossings. Both Union and Confederate armies occupied the town at different times between 1861 and 1865. The surrounding county was the site of several military operations, including the [Battle of Kelly's Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kelly%27s_Ford "Battle of Kelly's Ford") and the [Battle of Brandy Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Brandy_Station "Battle of Brandy Station"), the latter being the largest cavalry engagement of the war.[^19] The Battle of Culpeper Court House occurred nearby on September 13, 1863.[^20]

Notable figures with connections to the town include Confederate General [A.P. Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.P._Hill "A.P. Hill"), who was born there, and Major [John Pelham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pelham_\(officer\) "John Pelham (officer)"), who died in Culpeper following wounds sustained at Kelly's Ford.[^21]

Following the war, the town was rechartered under the name Culpeper in 1869. The postwar period included efforts to restore agriculture and infrastructure. Freedpeople established churches and schools during Reconstruction, and new civic institutions developed through the late 19th century.[^22]

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Culpeper served as a regional market center and stop along major rail lines. After a courthouse fire in 1870 destroyed many public records, new construction contributed to the town’s architectural development. By 1900, the town featured hotels, banks, a telegraph office, and multiple newspapers.[^23] Civic life expanded during the early 20th century, and by the 1970s the town supported organizations such as a Choral Society, an Odd Fellows Hall, and an American Legion Hall.[^24]

Growth accelerated in the late 20th century as commuters from Northern Virginia and the Washington metropolitan area increasingly relocated to Culpeper. Residential development and new infrastructure accompanied this shift, and in 1997 the Library of Congress opened the [National Audiovisual Conservation Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audiovisual_Conservation_Center "National Audiovisual Conservation Center") at a former Federal Reserve facility southeast of town.[^25] Revitalization efforts continued into the 21st century, with East Davis Street recognized in 2011 by the American Planning Association as one of "America’s Great Places" for its preserved architecture and role in downtown renewal.[^26]

### Recent history

On August 23, 2011, Culpeper was among the communities affected by the [2011 Virginia earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Virginia_earthquake "2011 Virginia earthquake"). Several structures on Main Street and East Davis Street sustained damage, and some were later condemned.[^27] The National Audiovisual Conservation Center was temporarily evacuated during a public event hosted by U.S. Senator [Mark Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Warner "Mark Warner").[^28]

In 2014, the Museum of Culpeper History relocated to the town’s historic train depot.[^29] In 2024, the state of Virginia formally opened [Culpeper Battlefields State Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpeper_Battlefields_State_Park "Culpeper Battlefields State Park"), encompassing parts of the Brandy Station and Cedar Mountain battlefields.[^30]

As of 2025, the county government has undertaken capital projects such as the construction of a new fieldhouse, alongside additional infrastructure and environmental initiatives.[^31] Tourism has also expanded, with direct visitor spending reaching $77.9 million in 2024.[^32] The town's Department of Tourism and Economic Development has supported local businesses through investment grants and initiatives such as "Be a Culpeper Local Week".[^33]

Culpeper has also drawn national attention for balancing preservation with modern growth. While the establishment of the Culpeper Technology Zone and proposed data center and solar developments have contributed to the local economy, preservation groups have raised concerns about the impact of such projects on historic battlefield landscapes.[^34] In August 2025, the county's Department of Economic Development received six Excellence in Economic Development Awards from the International Economic Development Council.[^35]

## Geography

Culpeper is in the Piedmont region of Virginia, approximately 70 miles (113 km) southwest of [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") and 50 miles (80 km) north of [Richmond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia "Richmond, Virginia"). The town lies at the intersection of [U.S. Route 29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_29 "U.S. Route 29") and [U.S. Route 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_15 "U.S. Route 15"), two major highways that provide important access to central and northern Virginia. According to the [United States Census Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau "United States Census Bureau"), the town of Culpeper has a total area of 6.3 square miles (16.3 km²), of which 6.2 square miles (16.1 km²) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km²), or 1.52%, is water.[^36]

### Topography

Culpeper’s terrain is characterized by rolling hills within the Piedmont Plateau, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Elevation ranges from about 300 feet in the east to nearly 600 feet in the west. The county is bounded by the [Rappahannock River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappahannock_River "Rappahannock River") to the north and the [Rapidan River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidan_River "Rapidan River") to the south.[^37]

### Neighborhoods

Residential and cultural life centers around a number of historic and modern neighborhoods. The area known as “Fishtown,” located along Commerce Street, Waters Place, and Locust Street, developed as a business and residential district with a strong African American community presence. Nearby enclaves included Tin Cup Alley, Whipple Alley, Slabtown, Jeffrey Town, and Sugar Bottom.[^38]

### Townscape

The central business district is largely encompassed by the [Culpeper Historic District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpeper_Historic_District "Culpeper Historic District"), a 50-acre area established in 1982 to preserve the town’s architectural and historic character. Buildings within the district are subject to review by the town’s Architectural Review Board for exterior changes visible from public streets.[^39] Within downtown, “The Wharf,” at the lower end of East Davis Street, historically served as a center for freight, services, and commercial activity, complementing the residential and business mix of Fishtown.[^38]

### Climate

Culpeper has a [humid subtropical climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_subtropical_climate "Humid subtropical climate") ([Köppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") *Cfa*), with very warm, humid summers and cool winters. Precipitation is abundant and well spread (although the summer months are usually wetter), with an annual average of 45.19 in (1,148 mm).
