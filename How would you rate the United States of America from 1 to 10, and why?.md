I rate the US an 8.5. That’s because I’m pretty much an 8.5. I’m in the top 15% of most things I do measured on a national basis. So 85% of the time, I’m satisfied and winning. Most of the things I know, I’ve learned here. My ability comes from my own discipline and dedication of course, but I also do it in the context of a free and open society. I have all kinds of opportunities to make things work and try again if I fail, and the culture and society of America expect me to try. In other words, America encourages me to be be free. “It’s a free country.”

I have no concerns about infrastructure. Things just work. The buses, the trains, the planes, the trucks, the electricity, the roads, the air conditioning, the supermarkets, the department stores, the internet, the radio, gas lines, the plumbing, the water, the mail, the traffic signals, the hospitals, the sewers, the garbage collection, the buildings, the fire department.

Right now we have 4% unemployment. Here in Los Angeles the air is clean. We have mountains, beaches, deserts, rivers, forests, lakes, plains, and a few swamps.

In fact, I even get bored saying what’s right about America. It’s way easier to tell you what I don’t like about it. And I think that’s true of most people which is why that’s mostly what people hear about America. But it is almost trivially easy for me to avoid what’s wrong in America, and so I do.

As the poet once said, “No man is an island.. every man’s death diminishes me”, but I add to that ‘like the gravitational constant each death diminishes at the square of the distance’. I stay clear of bad things, and I don’t need to be diminished or think negatively. And I can do this with confidence because I know that there are millions of Americans who work every day to solve the problems we face. We literally try to cure cancer and live forever. We make bread without wheat for people who are allergic. We have special sports competitions for people born with defects.

I wish people from every country could come to America and live here for six months. Well, actually that is 95% the case. I think there are 7 out of 138 that are banned. If you get the chance…
