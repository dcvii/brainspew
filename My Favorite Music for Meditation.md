I’ve recently made changes to my daily regimen—these include more exercise, less sugar and carbs, and other building blocks toward serenity and physical health. But the biggest change has been daily meditation.

I try to find forty minutes per day for it. That’s not easy—like many of you, I lead a busy life. To find time for meditation, I’ve had to give up other things.

And what can I give up?

I eventually made the obvious decision. I gave up screen time to make room for contemplation.

This was a wise choice. I now get a double benefit—I’m less caught in by the noise and dopamine-driven ephemera of digital life, and I add to this the inner peace and joyfulness that comes from meditating. It feels like I’m detoxing my heart and soul.

I should have done this a long time ago. Now that I can feel the benefits, I can’t imagine going back.

But my quiet time meditating isn’t really quiet. I use music as part of my pathway to serenity.

I don’t pretend to be an expert on meditation, so I will avoid giving any detailed advice—you can find other teachers for that. But I do know music, and have quite a bit of expertise on how sound impacts our bodies and spirits. I’ve been researching that subject for more than 25 years.

So I will share some useful soundtrack suggestions for your own forays into meditation. May you find bliss on your journey.

#### John Luther Adams: Become Ocean

In a 1927 letter to Sigmund Freud, mystic and author Romain Rolland claimed that we experience an “oceanic feeling” when we connect with eternity and achieve a sense of “being one with the external world as a whole.” This oceanic feeling is at the heart of both mysticism and meditation. Freud believed that it originated in that glorious moment in infancy before we are even aware of our ego or individuality.

[John Luther Adams](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-brilliant-bad-decisions-of-john) ’ *Become Ocean* is a musical evocation of that feeling, and also a pathway into experiencing it. For 42 minutes, the listener is swept away by huge orchestral sounds that earned Adams a Pulitzer Prize in Music. This is one of the most powerful immersive works of music I’ve ever heard, and feels almost as inexhaustible as the natural forces it aims to channel.

#### Miles Davis: In a Silent Way

In the music history books, this 1969 album gets eclipsed by Davis’s million-selling *Bitches Brew* from the following year. And it’s tempting to take it for granted—Miles recorded it in a single day, and the hard work of turning it into a commercial album fell on the shoulders of producer Teo Macero. That’s why some dismiss it as a cut-and-paste job from an artist destined for greater things.

But that’s a mistake.

This is one of the classics of electric jazz, and possesses a holistic quality that Miles rarely matched in subsequent years. If you dare meditate to Miles, this is the place to start.

As an alternative, let me recommend Bill Laswell’s remix of this music. Any musician who tries to “reconstruct” and “translate” Miles Davis is either boldly inspired or plain foolish—but in this case Laswell succeeds beyond my highest hopes. In some ways, this surpasses the original recording.

#### Bill Laswell: Panthalassa: The Music of Miles Davis 1969–1974

#### Pauline Oliveros, Stuart Dempster & Panaiotis: Deep Listening

All true music lovers believe in deep listening, but Pauline Oliveros staked everything on it. She popularized the term, and also established the Deep Listening Institute in 1985. Its work continues today via the Center for Deep Listening in Troy, New York.

In 1988, Oliveros also formed the Deep Listening Band along with trombonist Stuart Dempster and vocalist Panaiotis. Their album is appropriately entitled (you guessed it) *Deep Listening*. How deep, you might ask? For a start, their music was made in an empty underground cistern—with impressive acoustics that create a 45-second sound decay.

For our purposes, however, we embrace *Deep Listening* as an invitation to deep meditation.

#### Anonymous 4: The Lily and the Lamb

I listen to lots of medieval and early Renaissance music, and not just for meditation. I have a half dozen early music playlists that I often turn to for enjoyment and inspiration. But my favorite recordings feature the Anonymous Four—a female a cappella quartet, based in New York, that released more than twenty albums between 1986 and 2016.

The blending of their four voices is angelic—there’s really no better word for it. Even when they deliver a simple monophonic melody, the music is lush and resonant. I follow closely the various vocal ensembles that perform in this style, and I’ve never heard another approach this level of pristine transcendence.

You can start almost anywhere in their oeuvre, but a good entry point is *The Lily and the Lamb* from 1995.

#### Terry Riley: A Rainbow in Curved Air

Terry Riley is a very deep, spiritual person, so I’m not surprised that so many of his recordings help the listener achieve a trance-like state. His organ music is especially suitable for this, and you may also want to check out *Persian Surgery Dervishes* and *Shri Camel*. But the place to start is *A Rainbow in Curve Air* from 1969. It sounded futuristic and otherworldly back then, and still does today. With all respect to Harold Arlen, this is your true musical pathway to the end of the rainbow.

#### Meditative Mind: Om Mantra Chanting @528 Hertz

You can’t beat this soundtrack for meditating—it’s more than three hours of Om—the [most powerful sound in the universe](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-most-powerful-sound-in-the-world). Are you ready? Can you handle it?

If you have doubts, check out the comments to this video. People have used this music every day for years and testify to its life-changing powers. And don’t just listen—I encourage to chant Om along with it. Naysayers will gripe that it’s just a loop, but they’re missing the point.

#### Henry Purcell: Twelve Sonatas in Three Parts

This is more conventional music—although I’m reluctant to use the word *conventional* in tandem with Henry Purcell. He deserves better than his usual assigned role as a secondary figure in the great flowering of British culture during the 17th century. None of his pieces show up in lists of the 100 most frequently performed classical works. That’s not fair.

They recently [discovered new music by Purcell](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/07/experts-find-music-english-composer-henry-purcell), and almost nobody noticed. But I cherish his compositions, and listen to them often.

This is my suggested entry point into his instrumental music. I’ve also found it suitable for use in meditation.

#### Zakir Hussain: Making Music

This 1987 album represents a significant moment in the musical dialogue between East and West. Hussain, who left us a few months ago at age 74, is the great tabla player of his generation. Here he joins forces with Hindustani flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia, jazz fusion guitarist John McLaughlin, and Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek. Their collaboration is luminous and and serenity inducing.
