Lawful permanent residents (LPR), or “green card” holders, may live and work anywhere in the United States. After a certain amount of time, they may apply to become U.S. citizens if they meet the requirements.    
  
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides several ways to gain LPR status. These are called classes of admission. The largest class is family reunification. The United States also grants LPR status for economic and humanitarian reasons. Diversity also plays a role. Immigrants from countries with relatively low levels of immigration to the United States can gain LPR status.

Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens make up the largest category (more than 40%) of new LPRs. These include spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens age 21 and older. This category is not subject to numerical limits.
