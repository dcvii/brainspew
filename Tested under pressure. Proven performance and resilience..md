## Traditional benchmarks miss the moments that matter.

Most performance tests show how databases behave in perfect conditions, but the real world isn’t perfect. Failures happen where zones go offline, networks get flaky, and upgrades introduce risk.

That’s why we created the Performance under Adversity benchmark: to measure how databases perform when things break. We go beyond traditional TPC-C tests to measure performance during real-world failures. You’ll get continuous, time-series insights into throughput, latency, and recovery at every step. This interactive benchmark helps you identify weak spots before they affect your users and architect for true availability.

This is what resilience looks like. This is what modern benchmarking demands.

## Benchmarked for:

## 1\. Baseline Performance

Measure steady-state throughput under normal conditions.

## 2\. Internal Operational Stress

Simulate database-intensive operations such as CDC, full backups, schema changes, and rolling upgrades.

## 3\. Disk Stalls

Randomly inject I/O freezes to evaluate storage resilience.

## 4\. Network Failures

Simulate node-to-node network partitions.

## 5\. Node Restarts

Unpredictably reboot database nodes (1 at a time) to test recovery time.

## 6\. Zone Outages

Take down all nodes in an availability zone (AZ).

## 7\. Regional Outages

Take down all nodes in a region.
