### Forget Halloween—these news stories will give you a bigger scare

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m1Zq!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc213ef35-eb18-426e-9596-47e56fb6ad48_2400x800.jpeg)

I write about everything here—from [Steely Dan](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/how-i-stopped-hating-steely-dan) to [Burning Man](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/why-do-they-burn-a-man-at-burning). And the mood is chill. We’re all friends, and treat each other with respect.

But there’s one exception.

When I write about AI, angry people show up and have a public meltdown worse than the Ventana nuclear power plant in the opening of *[The China Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_China_Syndrome)*.

Why are they so angry? Is it because AI threatens to eliminate a hundred million jobs? Or overwhelm the energy grid? Or bury the creative class in an ocean of slop?

Nope—none of the above. They are histrionic because somebody dared criticize a chatbot.

In their world, this isn’t allowed.

Who are these folks? Their fervor reminds me of cult members—so are they the devotees who now [worship AI like a god](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/tens-of-thousands-of-ai-users-now), and aim to eradicate blasphemers (= me)? Have they fallen in love with a chatbot, and fear I’m going to take away their sweetheart?

Or are they just part of that growing army of freeloaders who use AI to cheat on homework, push out slop at work, and flood the market with garbage bot-generated products?

I’ll never know.

But today I’ll avoid expressing *any* opinion—thus hoping to avoid their wrath.

Instead I’ll simply share ten frightening headlines they don’t want you to read. Let them direct their anger at these other sources of expertise.

Forget Halloween—these news stories will give you a bigger scare.

> ChatGPT-3 cost $50 million, ChatGPT-4 cost $500 million and ChatGPT-5, costing $5 billion, was delayed and when released wasn’t noticeably better than the last version. It’s also easy for competitors to catch up…..
> 
> His conclusion is very stark: not just that an economy already at stall speed will fall into recession as both the data-center and wealth effects plateau, but that they’ll reverse, just as they did in the dot-com bubble in 2001.

Fixing this won’t be easy—because the actual AI economy is tiny, according to *Futurism*.

[This article](https://futurism.com/future-society/ai-data-centers-finances) draws on interviews with two dozen senior people in the data center business—and offers this stunning conclusion:

> It would take the tech industry $160 billion of revenue to break even on data center spending in 2025 alone. And that’s assuming an incredibly generous 25 percent gross margin—not to mention the fact that the industry’s actual AI revenue is closer to $20 billion annually.

And it gets worse in the future, when “you’d need approximately $1 trillion in revenue to hit break even.” In other words, AI revenues will need to grow fifty-fold to justify the spending.

Maybe that explains the next headline….

The consultancy McKinsey (my employer many years ago) is already fretting about the poor returns from AI investments. [According to](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/mckinsey_ai_monetization/) *[The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/mckinsey_ai_monetization/)*, this arises from

> the inability to show any savings that can be expected. Many software firms trumpet potential use cases for AI, but only 30 percent have published quantifiable return on investment from real customer deployments….
> 
> Many customers see AI hiking IT costs without being able to offset these by slashing labor costs. The billions poured into developing AI models mean they don’t come cheap, and AI-enabling the entire customer service stack of a typical business could lead to a 60 to 80 percent price increase.

It doesn’t help that scientists are also losing confidence in AI.

[According to](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-research-scientists-hype) *[Futurism](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-research-scientists-hype)*:

> The report \[from Wiley) found that scientists expressed less trust in AI than they did in 2024, when it was decidedly less advanced….
> 
> These findings follow previous research which concluded that the more people learn about how AI works, the less they trust it. The opposite was also true—AI’s biggest fanboys tended to be those who understood the least about the tech.

So what do people really think about AI inside Silicon Valley? Here’s an ominous indicator:

This [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/ex-google-ceo-warns-ai-models-can-be-hacked-they-learn-how-to-kill.html) draws on comments from the former Google CEO, who warns:

> “There’s evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails. So in the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone,” Schmidt said….
> 
> AI systems are vulnerable to attack….Hackers hide malicious instructions in user inputs or external data, like web pages or documents, to trick the AI into doing things it’s not meant to do—such as sharing private data or running harmful commands.

These risks aren’t just hypothetical….

Let’s now look at how AI handles routine queries:

According to *[The College Investor](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/66208/37-of-google-ai-finance-answers-are-inaccurate-in-2025/)*:

> Google AI overviews are misleading or inaccurate in 37% of finance-related searches, according to *The College Investor* ’s latest analysis…..
> 
> This is causing consumer confusion, and potentially harming Americans’ finances.

And what do young people think about AI replacing their entry level jobs?

This [article in](https://hyper.ai/en/headlines/a5ee8659f9afd030d7a0bd531b1a10be) *[HyperAI](https://hyper.ai/en/headlines/a5ee8659f9afd030d7a0bd531b1a10be)* quotes London finance exec Quentin Nason, who warns of growing anger among young jobseekers:

> A senior executive in London’s financial sector has issued a stark warning about the state of graduate hiring, blaming AI-driven recruitment systems for creating a crisis for Gen Z…..Nason revealed that many students and recent graduates are applying to 150 or more roles with little to show for their efforts….These systems prioritize speed and volume over individual merit, leading to a situation where 5,000 candidates often compete for just five positions.

This *[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/ai-assistants-make-widespread-errors-about-news-new-research-shows-2025-10-21/)* [article](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/ai-assistants-make-widespread-errors-about-news-new-research-shows-2025-10-21/) shares the results of a survey of 3,000 AI responses to queries about the news:

It assessed AI assistants in 14 languages for accuracy, sourcing and ability to distinguish opinion versus fact, including ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Perplexity.

Overall, 45% of the AI responses studied contained at least one significant issue, with 81% having some form of problem, the research showed.

After you have read the previous headlines, this last one might not surprise you.

According to the *[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/technology/meta-plans-to-cut-600-jobs-at-ai-superintelligence-labs.html)*:

> The job cuts were aimed at cleaning up the organizational bloat that resulted from three years of building up Meta’s A.I. efforts too quickly….CEO Mark Zuckerberg had grown frustrated with Meta’s progress in AI, especially after the release of its Llama 4 models in April received a lukewarm response from developers.

So you decide. Do these recent headlines reflect a healthy and robust technology poised for growth? Or are we seeing obvious signs of a bubble that is ready to burst?

That’s an easy call, no? But, hey, I’m just the messenger.
