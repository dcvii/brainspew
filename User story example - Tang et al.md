Give me an example user story of the sort of interactions that the authors are proposing.

---

Here’s an example user story that illustrates the kind of interaction the authors of *Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands* (Tang et al., 2025) are proposing:

---

### Scenario: Shopping for Clothes in an E-Commerce Feed

- **Round 0 (Initial Feed):**  
	The user opens a shopping app and sees a set of recommended short skirts.
	**User Command:**  
	*“How come these are all short skirts? It’s autumn now, I’d like to see long skirts.”*
	→ The Parser agent converts this into a structured preference: *positive = long skirts; negative = short skirts.*  
	→ The Planner agent filters the candidate pool and adjusts the scoring so long skirts rise to the top.

---

- **Round 1 (Updated Feed):**  
	The system now displays mostly long skirts.
	**User Command:**  
	*“Are there any in light blue?”*
	→ Parser updates preferences (positive = light blue, long skirts).  
	→ Planner integrates the new color preference into its tool chain.

---

- **Round 2 (Refinement):**  
	The user now sees several long skirts, some light blue, some not.
	**User Command:**  
	*“Just around 200.”* (budget constraint)
	→ Parser adds a *hard constraint*: price ≈ 200.  
	→ Planner filters out items above this threshold.

---

- **Round 3 (Negative Feedback):**  
	The system shows budget-friendly long skirts, including floral designs.
	**User Command:**  
	*“Don’t want any floral dresses.”*
	→ Parser sets a *negative preference* for floral patterns.  
	→ Planner attenuates scores of floral items.

---

- **Round 4 (Convergence):**  
	The system presents a long, light blue dress around the desired budget, not floral.
	**User Feedback:**  
	*“Perfect, I love this long dress!”*
	→ Interaction ends with user satisfaction.

---

This step-by-step interaction (shown in *Figure 8 on page 14* of the paper) demonstrates how the **Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF)** and **RecBot** framework let users iteratively refine results through free-form natural language commands. Instead of being limited to likes/dislikes, the user can actively steer recommendations by articulating preferences, constraints, and negative feedback, with the system dynamically adapting in real time.

Would you like me to also create a **short “scripted dialogue” version** (like a chat transcript) that could be reused directly as an example in a product design context?
