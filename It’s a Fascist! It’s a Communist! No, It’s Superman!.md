It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s an inane culture war!

The new *Superman* film, released over the weekend, turned, predictably enough, into a partisan issue.

Director James Gunn [started things off on July 4](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp) —of all days—by reminding us in an interview that Superman is “an immigrant,” albeit one who arrived from outer space.

You’ll never guess what happened next: *Superman is [superwoke](https://decider.com/2025/07/08/new-superman-movie-maga-woke-backlash/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)*, cried the right, in essays, [op-eds](https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/07/11/did-you-know-superman-was-an-immigrant-my-review-of-superman/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and numerous cable segments. X was full of [predictions from the right](https://x.com/JesseKellyDC/status/1941917919383826912) that this was another case of “ [go woke, go broke](https://x.com/ericmetaxas/status/1941982930374447373).” Then—naturally—the White House suggested that Donald Trump is the real Superman, by posting a [mock movie poster](https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1943493150644777199) of the president in Lycra regalia. Gavin Newsom parried back, saying that Superman was not only an immigrant but “ [an undocumented one](https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1943527085257142411).”

Not that everyone on the left was enthused.

This weekend, over at *The New York Times*, Dominican American author Junot Díaz [wrote a lengthy takedown](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/opinion/superman-movie-immigrant-junot-diaz.html) of *Superman*, complaining that an alien from the planet Krypton that was given extraordinary powers by the Earth’s yellow sun did not reflect his own immigration experience. To him, Superman was too assimilated, too patriotic, too rah-rah America for his liking.

“From Day 1, dude just rubbed me the wrong way,” wrote Díaz, a Pulitzer Prize winner. “There was the obvious stuff, like how goofy Superman was as a hero, how ridiculously dated his star-spangled patriotism was.”

Díaz, who admits in his column that he hasn’t even seen the new movie, also buys into the old idea, in a roundabout way, that there’s something a bit fascist about Superman, comparing America’s hero to the “superman” of his youth, [Rafael Trujillo](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rafael-Trujillo), the DR’s brutal dictator. It’s an accusation that’s dogged superheroes since the beginning. It was the Nazis, after all, who tried to actually build a race of supermen through their breeding programs and [Dr. Josef Mengele](https://www.auschwitz.org/en/history/medical-experiments/josef-mengele/) ’s experiments in the extermination camps. As early as 1954, the German-born psychiatrist Fredric Wertham made the case that Superman would pollute young minds in his influential book *Seduction of the Innocent* —which set off a moral panic and a [Congressional inquiry](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2022/10/the-senate-comic-book-hearings-of-1954/) into the comic book industry.

But perhaps the most famous inquiry into the fascistic tendencies of superheroes is [Alan Moore’s](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781779501127) *[Watchmen](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781779501127)*, published in 1987. One of Moore’s crime-fighting antiheroes is named Rorschach, a deranged, radicalized figure hidden behind a mask mimicking the famous inkblot test. Whether Rorschach is a hero, appropriately enough, is up to the reader. Likewise Superman, now in his zillionth iteration, will always be a Rorschach test for America.

Defying predictions, when the movie was finally released Friday, it immediately reached [blockbuster status](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/13/business/media/superman-warner-bros-box-office.html), and audiences are [loving it](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025). I have actually seen it. And I can confirm that *Superman* is a perfectly entertaining movie, not worthy of half the accusations thrown at it. But the controversy is understandable. We care about Superman because he is a stand-in for our country, or at least this country at its best. We’re skeptical of him going on ideological crusades for fear we’ll be called to join him.

If you know anything about the history of Superman, these accusations of fascism are particularly ironic. Because the notion of an American superman has always been caught up in the Jewish experience of America—specifically, those Jews who came over en masse at the turn of the 20th century.

In 1908, Israel Zangwill, an English Jew and prominent Zionist, wrote a play called *The Melting Pot*, which imagined that the mix of immigrants making their way through Ellis Island would combine to create a new people, one greater than the world had ever seen: “The real American has not yet arrived. He is only in the crucible, I tell you. He will be the fusion of all races, perhaps the coming superman.”

The Superman we all know would arrive 30 years after Zangwill’s play on the cover of *Action Comics*, the creation of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, two sons of Jewish immigrants who had grown up in Cleveland together. Their parents had escaped the pogroms of Eastern Europe and, by extension, the even greater horrors yet to come.

These two all-American boys from the Midwest, conscious of their luck at growing up in the United States, liked the idea of Superman as a global actor. By 1939, one year after his debut, he’s bringing peace to the war-torn nation of Boravia. By 1940, [as](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/superman-backlash) *[Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/superman-backlash)* [recently noted](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/superman-backlash), he was [fighting both Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin](https://archive.org/details/HowSupermanWouldEndTheWar_144/page/n1/mode/2up) in the pages of *Look* magazine. In 1942, after America entered World War II, radio listeners were introduced to a Superman who fought for “truth, justice, and the American way.”

In the decade that followed, the fight for truth and justice remained his calling card. “The American way” returned in fits and starts, depending on the political mood. The phrase reappeared during the *Superman* reboot that arrived during the Red Scare of the 1950s, for instance. It came back in 1978, when Christopher Reeve played Superman, as the cynical ’70s were coming to a close and Ronald Reagan’s gung-ho patriotism was ascendant.

James Gunn’s Superman was designed to be an immigrant out of Stephen Miller’s nightmares—quite literally an invader bent on destroying us.

When, in an ill-fated 2006 reboot, Brandon Routh’s Superman stood only for “truth and justice”—no mention of “the American way”—it caused [a political dust up](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/30/opinion/30lundegaard.html#:~:text=His%20response%20%E2%80%94%20%22To%20help%22,Even%20a%20Superman) not so different from the one we’re seeing today. Conservative commentators, back in the heady days of the blogosphere, crowed that Superman had abandoned America, and complained that he didn’t look like the Superman we know and love.

All of which is to say, the current *mishegas* over *Superman* was inevitable. However you dress him up, Superman is no doubt a patriot: His enemies are America’s enemies, whether they be Nazis, Klansmen, communists, or what Teddy Roosevelt called “malefactors of great wealth,” a figure his nemesis Lex Luthor always represents. In the 2020s, an era when patriotism is [red-button again](https://www.thefp.com/p/im-finally-hanging-my-american-flag-america-at-250), of course there was going to be controversy.

So what does this new Superman ultimately stand for?

He is on a crusade against Boravia—which is, at first glance, a stand-in for Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The Boravians all speak a Slavic language. The country, waging war on a neighboring state, is ruled by a dictator who always claims that he had no choice but to invade, and is dismayed that any American would object. We learn from a conversation with Lois Lane that, before the movie began, Superman took it upon himself to stop Boravia’s invasion of this state—without consulting the U.S. government. Indeed, Lane accuses Superman of essentially torturing the wild-haired dictator by flying him off to the desert and pressing him up against a cactus; Superman counters that while he acted unilaterally, the torture was pretty mild, and he saved a lot of lives in the process.

So is Superman a neoconservative? A Ukraine hawk?

Not so fast! It turns out that the U.S. government considers the aggressor, Boravia, a problematic ally, funded by Luthor, who in this reboot is a crude simulacrum for Elon Musk. The nation it’s invading is called Jarhanpur, and is an oil-rich desert. Its impoverished citizens are, to borrow an oft-used euphemism from the start of the Global War on Terror, *olive-skinned*. So is Boravia actually Israel, not Russia? Is this thing just a big metaphor for the Gaza war? (On the left, there has been much rejoicing that the movie appears to be anti-Israel; for what it’s worth, the Israeli press [seems to like it](https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-new-superman-movie-doesnt-fly-in-the-face-of-convention-and-thats-a-good-thing/) just fine.)

The UK’s left-leaning *Guardian* went so far as to complain that the movie is not explicit enough, that Superman should be involved in a real-world war, [not one between countries](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn) that are “so palpably made up and without inconvenient political associations and implications.” Should we really be taking this movie’s politics so seriously or literally? Of course not. In the same interview when he noted that Superman is an “immigrant,” Gunn observed: “There is also a flying dog in the film that wears a cape.”

There are ideas here, political ones. In a left-field addition to the lore, Superman learns that his revered alien parents wanted him to collect a harem on Earth and rule humanity with an iron fist—a plot twist that leads to the U.S. government handing him over to Luthor’s goons. When Superman inevitably escapes, he goes back to Smallville to be with his adoptive, all-American parents. Gunn’s Superman was designed to be an immigrant out of Stephen Miller’s nightmares—quite literally an invader bent on destroying us. And yet, quiet American values got to him.

But the politics don’t cohere and don’t need to. Superman and *Superman* are whatever you want them to be. Woke, rightist, centrist, patriotic, apolitical—what you see is a reflection of yourself, your own beliefs about the world. That’s the real genius of the character, and has been since its creation; Gunn’s great trick is understanding this, hence why this is the first successful *Superman* reboot of the 21st century.

The best way to take in his movie? Just let it wash over you. The return of John Williams’s iconic score is rousing. There are moments of real tension, including perhaps the best riff on “ [saving a baby in trouble” since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJpRSf4q-hI) *[The Untouchables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJpRSf4q-hI)*. And the [flying dog](https://deadline.com/2024/12/superman-trailer-krypto-james-gunn-1236237905/#:~:text=Superman%20and%20Krypto%20the%20Superdog,what%20we've%20seen.%E2%80%9D)? Delightful.

There is no explicit agenda other than creating a crowd-pleasing movie that makes a lot of money for Warner Bros. Mission accomplished. Hats off to Gunn, whatever his politics: Just like baby Superman arriving by luck, grace, or fate on the American farm that forged him, he stuck the landing.
