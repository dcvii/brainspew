As a mobile app developer, you must have encountered questions like “Did you integrate the API?” “Can you give me an easy API Development tutorial?” If you have heard the term ‘API’ countless times in your interactions with fellow app developers, this article is here to provide all you need to know about API development. From understanding what an API is to delving into API development, learning how to use APIs, and how APIs work, we’ll cover it all. So, without further ado, let’s get into it.

## What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs are vital bridges facilitating communication between different software components. They operate by following specific definitions and protocols, allowing seamless interaction in [mobile app development](https://www.technbrains.com/services/mobile-app-development/). For instance, Let’s take an [Alexa-enabled device](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/devices/connected-devices), like an [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B07XKF5RM3), in your smart home. The manufacturers of both your smart home devices (thermostat, lighting system, security camera) and Alexa provide APIs that allow these devices to communicate with each other.

Here is how it could work:

### Voice Commands via Alexa:

You can use voice commands with Alexa to control your smart home. For example, you say, “Alexa, turn on the lights” or “Alexa, set the thermostat to 72 degrees.”

### Alexa’s API Integration:

Alexa’s API communicates with the respective APIs of your smart devices. When you give a command, Alexa uses its API to relay instructions to the lighting system and thermostat.

### Smart Automation:

Let’s say you’ve set up a routine on the Alexa app. If Alexa detects your voice command requesting a specific temperature and lighting condition, it communicates through APIs with the thermostat and lighting system to execute your preferences.

### Security Integration:

If your security camera detects unusual motion, it can trigger an alert. Alexa, through its API, can communicate this alert to the lighting system to flash the lights or make an announcement, enhancing your home security.

The [APIs](https://techibytes.com/api-ideas-you-can-build/) act as mediators, enabling seamless communication between disparate devices and platforms and turning your smart home into an interconnected and automated environment. This not only enhances convenience but also showcases the power of APIs in creating integrated and intelligent systems. This is just an API development example to get started. I will be sharing more of them in the blog further.

## API integration

[API integration](https://www.technbrains.com/blog/what-is-api-integration/) is the seamless incorporation of application programming interfaces (APIs) into existing software systems, enabling them to communicate and share data effortlessly. This process involves connecting disparate applications, services, or platforms, allowing them to work together harmoniously. API integration is the backbone of modern software development, facilitating the exchange of information and functionalities across diverse technologies. 

Whether linking payment gateways, social media platforms, or third-party services, effective API integration streamlines operations, enhances user experiences and empowers applications to leverage external functionalities without the need for extensive redevelopment.

## Why are APIs Important?

API makes your third-party integrations easier and quicker. APIs go beyond merely connecting systems; they eliminate the necessity to create a new program or platform from the ground up. This flexibility allows developers and business leaders alike to concentrate on the API development process, recognizing its role in streamlining operations and fostering collaborative innovation.

## APIs by use cases

![This is an Image of showing "APIs By Use Cases"](https://www.technbrains.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/APIs-By-Use-Cases.png)

Types of APIs based on their use APIs are categorized according to the specific systems they are designed to interact with.

###     1. Database APIs

These APIs facilitate communication between applications and database management systems. Developers utilize queries to access and manipulate data within databases. For instance, the [Drupal 7 Database API](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/api/database-api/database-api-overview) allows users to create unified queries for various databases, including both proprietary and open-source options such as Oracle, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, CouchDB, and MSSQL. Another example is the [ORDS database API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-rest-data-services/19.1/aelig/enabling-ords-database-api.html#GUID-8730051B-7C03-487B-954A-7D6786B7EC74) embedded in Oracle REST Data Services.

###     2. Operating Systems APIs

This group of APIs outlines how applications utilize the resources and services of operating systems. Each operating system has its own set of APIs, such as the [Windows API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list) or Linux API, which comprises kernel user-space API and [kernel internal API](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/media/index.html). Apple provides API references for macOS and iOS in its [developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/), with Cocoa for macOS and Cocoa Touch for iOS.

###     3. Remote APIs

Remote APIs set standards for interactions between applications running on different machines. These APIs enable one software product to access resources located outside the requesting device. Typically, remote APIs are built on web standards, as applications on two remotely located machines connect over a communication network, often the Internet. Examples include the [Java Database Connectivity API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/) and [Java Remote Method Invocation API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/index.html).

###     4. Web APIs

The most common class of APIs, web APIs facilitate the transfer of machine-readable data and functionality between web-based systems, representing a [client-server architecture](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/438/clientserver-architecture). Web APIs handle requests from web applications and responses from servers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Developers leverage web APIs to enhance the functionality of their applications or websites. For instance, the [Pinterest API](https://developers.pinterest.com/) provides tools for incorporating users’ Pinterest data into a website, while the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) allows the integration of a map with an organization’s location.

Many businesses use multiple APIs to connect applications and share information, often requiring an API management tool to control, distribute, and analyze these various APIs.

## Understanding the Functionality of APIs

The functioning of APIs is often elucidated through the client-server architecture. In this context, the application initiating the request is termed the client, while the application generating the response is known as the server. Using the illustration of a weather application, the weather bureau’s database acts as the server, and the mobile app functions as the client.

### Various Ways APIs Operate

APIs exhibit distinct operational modes based on their creation time and purpose. The following are four types of APIs and their respective characteristics:

#### *SOAP APIs:*

SOAP stands for Service Object Access Protocol. These APIs operate through Simple Object Access Protocol, facilitating message exchange between the client and server using XML. Historically popular, SOAP APIs are deemed less flexible compared to contemporary alternatives.

![This is an Image of showing "SOAP XML request call"](https://www.technbrains.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SOAP-XML-request-call.png)

In Google Ad Manager, here’s an example of a SOAP XML request call. Source: [Google Ad Manager](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/soap_xml)

#### *RPC APIs:*

Known as Remote Procedure Calls, these APIs involve the client executing a function or procedure on the server, with the server subsequently transmitting the output back to the client.

#### *Websocket APIs:*

Representing a modern approach to web API development, Websocket APIs utilize JSON objects for data transmission. Offering two-way communication, this API enables the server to dispatch callback messages to connected clients, enhancing efficiency compared to REST API.

#### *REST APIs:*

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. Acknowledged as the most prevalent and adaptable APIs on the web, REST APIs operate by having the client transmit requests to the server as data. The server then utilizes this input to initiate internal functions, returning output data to the client. 

![This is an Image of representing "A GET request for restaurant information with a JSON response."](https://www.technbrains.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/A-GET-request-for-restaurant-information-with-a-JSON-response.png)

### gRPC

gRPC stands out as an innovative, open-source API framework categorized under RPC. Unlike SOAP, it’s a more recent entrant, introduced by Google in 2015. With gRPC, client applications seamlessly invoke methods from a server located on a different machine, treating it as a local object. This simplifies the creation of distributed services and applications.

While gRPC, like SOAP and REST, employs HTTP for transport, it offers developers the flexibility to define various function calls instead of adhering to predefined options like PUT and GET in REST.

![An Image showing "RPC method parameters and return types are illustrated"](https://www.technbrains.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RPC-method-parameters-and-return-types-are-illustrated.png)

RPC method parameters and return types are illustrated. source: [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) 

One notable distinction is that gRPC utilizes [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview), not JSON or XML, as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) for serializing structured data. Developers define the data structure, employ the protocol buffer compiler to generate data access classes in their preferred programming language. Then they compress and serialize the data in binary format at runtime. Consequently, gRPC finds extensive use in microservices communication due to its availability in multiple languages and high performance.

### GraphQL

![An image of "GraphQL" defining it with processes. ](https://www.technbrains.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GraphQL.png)

GraphQL emerged from the need for faster feature development, efficient data loading with increased mobile adoption, and diverse clients. Originally developed by Facebook in 2012 for internal purposes, GraphQL has become the new REST, embraced by organizations like Shopify, Yelp, GitHub, Coursera, and The New York Times for building APIs.

Functioning as a query language for APIs, GraphQL empowers clients to specify the precise data they require and streamlines data aggregation from multiple sources. Developers can use a single API call to request all necessary data. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)‘s distinctive feature involves using a type system to describe data. Using types to describe data enables apps to articulate their data needs, ensuring swift performance even with slower mobile connections. 

This breakdown serves to demystify the intricacies of API functionality, offering insights into their diverse types and their specific attributes.

## API Terminologies 

As a seasoned [mobile app developer](https://www.technbrains.com/services/hire-developer/), my journey has been peppered with encounters with various API development terms. I could not just learn them at the start, but I can say with experience that these terminologies, initially a maze, turned out to be important when learning API development. Let’s look at them below: 

### API Key

- A unique code serving as an authentication mechanism for API requests.
- In an analogy, consider it analogous to an exclusive access pass at a major event, allowing only privileged individuals (API Key holders) entry.

### Endpoint

- The designated interface where API systems establish communication.
- Visualize it as a pivotal transit point, comparable to a bus stop, where various buses (APIs) converge to exchange passengers (data).

### JSON

- JavaScript Object Notation is a data format facilitating the exchange of API request parameters and response bodies.
- Analogous to a comprehensive restaurant menu, JSON serves as a structured guide outlining available dishes (data).

### GET

- RESTful APIs employ the HTTP method to retrieve resources.
- Drawing parallels, envision it as instructing a librarian (API) to retrieve a specific book (resource).

### POST

- The HTTP method in RESTful APIs is utilized for creating new resources.
- This is analogous to entrusting a librarian (API) with a new book (data) to be added to the collection.

### OAuth

- A standardized authorization framework enabling user access without divulging direct credentials.
- In a metaphorical sense, it resembles an exclusive VIP card granting access without requiring an exhaustive disclosure of personal details.

### REST

- Representational State Transfer is a lightweight architectural approach enhancing communication efficiency between two devices/systems.
- Think of it as a methodical conductor, guiding devices to exchange references to data rather than transmitting entire data sets.

### SOAP

- Simple Object Access Protocol is a messaging protocol facilitating the structured exchange of information in web service execution.
- Consider SOAP as a meticulous filing system, streamlining the process of locating specific information swiftly.

### Latency

- The total time an API interface takes from the initiation of a request to the reception of a response.
- Analogous to the anticipation of pizza delivery, latency represents the time interval from placing an order to the pizza’s arrival at your doorstep.

### Rate-Limiting

- The mechanism regulating the pace at which an end user can access APIs.
- Comparable to controlling the flow of water from a tap, rate-limiting enables users to manage the speed of data retrieval.

### API Throttling

- The process of overseeing API usage by users within a specified timeframe.
- If, for instance, a user exceeds the designated limit of 1000 API requests per day, the server responds with an HTTP status 429, indicating “Too Many Requests.”

Now that we are equipped with the basics of APIs let us understand how APIs work in detail in the next section.

![Image of showing online store named "in my happy place" under the "Working of API"](https://www.technbrains.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Working-of-API.png)

Imagine a busy online store at [In My Happy Place](https://inmyhappyplace.net/), where people buy and sell happily. My task? Make it even better by adding [STRIPE](https://stripe.com/en-gb-us), a cool way to handle payments. While working, I faced a problem – Error 400. It said my request needed to be corrected, and maybe I needed to remember something. I looked through the code and checked with STRIPE’s rules. Ah-ha! I found a tiny mistake. After fixing it, I tried again, hoping for the best. The screen showed [HTTP 200](https://stripe.com/docs/api/errors), meaning success! STRIPE was now part of In My Happy Place, making payments smooth and secure.

In My Happy Place was created to help shop owners in the US. They needed an easy way to manage their stores online. Our solution, with STRIPE on board, made things simpler. As the top [Shopify web development company](https://www.technbrains.com/ecommerce/shopify-development-services/), TechnBrains made sure this journey transformed e-commerce for the better.

### How API Works

![an image showing "How API Works"](https://www.technbrains.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/How-API-Works.png)So, when you use apps or websites, do they fetch info or do stuff for you? That’s where APIS comes into play. Let’s have a look at how APIs work below: 

Think of APIs as messengers between your mobile apps. They help apps talk to each other and get things done. Here’s how it works:

1. **Asking for Help:** When your app needs something, like weather info or processing payments, it sends a message (request) to the API.
2. **Making a Request:** This message is like a formal request, saying exactly what the app needs. For example, if it’s about the weather, the app specifies that it wants the latest details.
3. **API Does the Work:** The API gets the request and understands it. If it’s a weather API, it goes and gets the latest weather info using its own rules.
4. **Getting a Reply:** After doing its thing, the API sends a message (response) back to the app. This message has the info the app asked for, all neatly organized.
5. **Putting It Together:** The app takes this message and uses the info in its own space. So, if it’s weather details, the app shows them to you.
6. **Different APIs for Different Jobs:** There are many types of APIs, each doing a specific job. Some handle weather, others deal with money stuff. Apps choose the API that fits their needs.
7. **Keeping Things Smooth:** APIs make sure your app works smoothly, offering different services without causing trouble for you.

In short, APIs act like friendly messengers, helping your apps work together and do cool things for you!

## Best Practices for Developing an API

![An image of Best Practices for Developing an API](https://www.technbrains.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Best-Practices-for-Developing-an-API-1.png)

As developers, we’ve weathered the storms and basked in the victories of API development. Let’s weave our experiences into these best practices, making them more than guidelines – they’re stories from the trenches:

### 1\. Use Throttling

In a project not too long ago, we found ourselves amidst a sudden surge in API traffic. App throttling became our unsung hero, redirecting the excess flow, seamlessly managing our backups, and standing tall against potential DoS attacks. It wasn’t just a tool; it was the stabilizing force that kept our API ship afloat.

### 2\. Empowering Control and Security 

Picture this – during a critical update, the API gateway emerged as our vigilant enforcer. We designated it strategically to enforce throttling rules, validate API keys, and implement OAuth seamlessly. It was the gatekeeper, ensuring only the right interactions occurred and our data remained secure.

### 3\. Allow Overriding HTTP Method

**I may** Recall the project where we had to adapt to proxies supporting limited methods. Enabling RESTful APIs to override the HTTP method became our go-to move. It was the adjustable toolkit in action, ensuring compatibility and flexibility in the ever-evolving API landscape.

### 4\. Evaluate APIs and Infrastructure

In the ongoing saga of API development, regular evaluations became our routine check-ups. Acting as caretakers, we assessed APIs and infrastructure for potential issues like memory leaks or CPU overload. Tools like AWS CloudWatch became our trusty companions, offering real-time insights into the heartbeat of our API ecosystem.
