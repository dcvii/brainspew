As I write these words, Israel is under attack by Iran. All of my friends in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are huddled with their families in bomb shelters. Some alarming [eyewitness video](https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1933592595445567992) showed [missile impacts](https://x.com/disclosetv/status/1933599999738479046) and interceptions in Tel Aviv and the surrounding area.

Iran promised a “bitter, painful” response—to what extent that promise will be fulfilled is what all Israelis and everyone concerned for those at the front line of the free world are wondering tonight.

It’s too soon to say how this will ultimately all shake out. What we can say with confidence is that this is a seismic, world-historical event. And it’s one we are built to cover.

*The Free Press* has access to the best historians, analysts, and reporters in the world. And today, we’re bringing them straight to your inbox: **Niall Ferguson** with the big-picture historical perspective; **Michael Doran** on how Israel pulled off what he calls the “ultimate deception”; Iranian dissident **Masih Alinejad** on how those who hunted her are finally becoming the hunted; **Matthew Continetti** on the political dimensions of this strike; and, from Israel, **Amit Segal** on Bibi Netanyahu’s masterstroke.

Who better to put the war in its proper context than Niall Ferguson, one of the world’s greatest historians?

One thing about Israel’s strike is clear: Iran was caught off guard. Why did these seasoned Iranian officers—veteran warriors, intelligence chiefs, regime survivors—lower their guard so completely? How did Israel achieve strategic surprise? Michael Doran—one of the sharpest analysts of the region—offers an answer in his essay for us today. Read his analysis to find out how Israel hid its strategy in plain sight

“I’ve spent the past four years of my life being hunted by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards,” writes author and activist Masih Alinejad. “They sent agents to kidnap me from my home in New York. They hired assassins to kill me on American soil. If not for the FBI’s protection—and the more than 21 safe houses I have shuttled between over the past few years—I might not be alive to write these words.”  
  
Read Masih’s reflections on a moment that isn’t just political—it’s deeply personal.

By tacitly supporting Israel’s strike on Iran, Donald Trump has taken a side in maybe the fiercest fight on the American right. Matt, who literally wrote the book on the American right, explains why—and what it means for the MAGA “restrainers” like Tucker Carlson, who thought the president was on their side.
