What is Prometheus? | New Relic

](https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/what-is-prometheus)

Prometheus observability is the practice of using the **Prometheus open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit** to gain insight into modern, distributed systems — especially those built with **microservices** and deployed in cloud-native environments like Kubernetes.[graphapp +3](https://www.graphapp.ai/blog/unlocking-prometheus-observability-a-comprehensive-guide)

## Overview

At its core, Prometheus enables **observability** by collecting and analyzing **metrics data** from applications and infrastructure components. Observability here refers to understanding system behavior and health through outputs (metrics, logs, and traces) to infer internal states and identify performance issues.[graphapp](https://www.graphapp.ai/blog/unlocking-prometheus-observability-a-comprehensive-guide)

Prometheus is part of the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** ecosystem and is a cornerstone tool for monitoring and observability pipelines alongside visualization systems like **Grafana** and alerting tools such as **Alertmanager**.[logz +1](https://logz.io/blog/prometheus-observability/)

## Key Components

- **Prometheus Server:** The main engine that collects and stores metrics as time-series data via a **pull model** over HTTP from defined targets.[newrelic](https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/what-is-prometheus)
- **PromQL:** A powerful and flexible **query language** to analyze time-series data, enabling users to extract insights and aggregate data dynamically.[logz](https://logz.io/blog/prometheus-observability/)
- **Time-Series Database:** Stores metrics efficiently with a **multi-dimensional model** defined by metric names and key-value labels, allowing fine-grained analysis.[tigera +1](https://www.tigera.io/learn/guides/prometheus-monitoring/)
- **Alertmanager:** Handles alerts generated by Prometheus, routing them to the proper notification channels (e.g., email, PagerDuty, OpsGenie), with features like deduplication and silencing.[logz](https://logz.io/blog/prometheus-observability/)

## Metric Types

Prometheus classifies metrics into four fundamental types:[tigera +1](https://www.tigera.io/learn/guides/prometheus-monitoring/)

- **Counter:** Monotonically increasing values (e.g., number of requests served).
- **Gauge:** Values that can go up and down (e.g., CPU usage, available memory).
- **Histogram:** Aggregates observed values into configurable buckets (e.g., request durations).
- **Summary:** Similar to histograms but computes streaming quantiles client-side.

## Observability Use Cases

Prometheus is widely used for:

- Monitoring **Kubernetes clusters** and **containerized applications**.
- Detecting **anomalies** and performance degradation through real-time metrics.
- Enabling **data-driven optimization** using PromQL queries.
- Setting up **automated alerts** to handle incidents proactively.[newrelic +3](https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/what-is-prometheus)

In summary, Prometheus observability combines powerful metric collection, flexible querying, and seamless integration with visualization and alerting tools — making it an essential part of any **observability stack** for modern distributed systems.[graphapp +2](https://www.graphapp.ai/blog/unlocking-prometheus-observability-a-comprehensive-guide)
