## What was at issue in the Bruen decision? What was the 9th Circuit's opinion? Where is the current status?



The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen case, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 23, 2022, addressed the constitutionality of New York's concealed carry licensing law. Specifically, the case challenged New York's "proper cause" requirement, which mandated that applicants for an unrestricted concealed carry license demonstrate a special need for self-protection beyond that of the general community. The plaintiffs, Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, were denied licenses for failing to show such a need and argued that this requirement violated their Second and Fourteenth Amendment rights to keep and bear arms for self-defense in public.

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas delivering the majority opinion, ruled that New York's proper-cause requirement was unconstitutional. The Court held that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home. The decision struck down "may-issue" permitting systems that rely on subjective evaluations of need, endorsing instead "shall-issue" systems where permits are granted based on objective criteria like background checks. The Court established a new test for evaluating Second Amendment challenges, requiring that firearm regulations be consistent with the "historical tradition of firearm regulation" in the United States, rejecting the two-step framework previously used by lower courts that balanced state interests with Second Amendment rights.

1. United States v. Duarte (2024): On May 9, 2024, a split Ninth Circuit panel held that 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), which prohibits firearm possession by felons, was unconstitutional as applied to Steven Duarte, a non-violent felon with prior state convictions. The court found that Duarte's possession of a handgun fell within the Second Amendment's protections and that the government failed to provide a "well-established and representative historical analogue" for a lifelong ban on non-violent felons. The panel vacated Duarte's conviction, but this decision was controversial, with posts on X suggesting it may face en banc review to potentially reverse it.
2. Teter v. Lopez (2024): In February 2024, the Ninth Circuit struck down Hawaii's ban on switchblade knives, citing Bruen. The court found no historical precedent for such a ban, indicating that switchblades were protected under the Second Amendment as arms for self-defense.
3. Jones v. Bonta (2022): On September 7, 2022, the Ninth Circuit reversed an earlier decision that had found California’s ban on semiautomatic rifles for adults under 21 unconstitutional. Post-Bruen, the court remanded the case to a district court for review under the new historical tradition test, reflecting a cautious approach to applying Bruen.
4. Rupp v. Bonta (2022): On June 28, 2022, the Ninth Circuit remanded a challenge to California’s assault weapons ban to a district court for reconsideration in light of Bruen, indicating that Bruen’s new test required re-evaluation of prior rulings.
5. Nguyen v. Bonta (2025): On June 26, 2025, the Ninth Circuit held that California’s one-gun-a-month purchase limit was unconstitutional under Bruen’s text-and-history test. The court found that the restriction lacked a historical analogue and violated the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.

Current Status

- Nationwide Impact: Bruen has led to numerous challenges to gun laws across the United States, with lower courts re-evaluating regulations under the historical tradition test. The Supreme Court has remanded several cases for reconsideration, and some circuits, like the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Rahimi (2023), have struck down laws (e.g., firearm bans for those under domestic violence restraining orders), though the Supreme Court later upheld that restriction in 2024.
- Pending Cases and En Banc Review: The Ninth Circuit has accepted en banc review in some post-Bruen cases, such as a challenge to a district court decision that had previously gone en banc pre-Bruen, indicating the circuit’s active engagement with Bruen’s framework. No specific en banc ruling directly addressing Bruen’s core holding has been detailed in the provided sources, but the circuit’s caseload suggests more decisions are forthcoming.
- Criticism and Judicial Frustration: Federal judges, including those in the Ninth Circuit, have criticized Bruen’s historical test as unworkable, arguing it requires judges to conduct complex historical research without expertise. This has led to inconsistent applications and calls for the Supreme Court to clarify or reconsider the test.
- Public and Legislative Response: States like California and New York have responded to Bruen by enacting new laws, such as New York’s Concealed Carry Improvement Act (2022), which designated sensitive places where firearms are banned. These laws face ongoing challenges, with mixed outcomes in lower courts. For example, the Second Circuit upheld parts of New York’s law in 2024, but the Supreme Court vacated earlier rulings for failing to properly apply Bruen.
