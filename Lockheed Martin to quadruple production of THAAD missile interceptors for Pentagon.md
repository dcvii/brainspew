- On Jan. 29, 2026 Lockheed Martin signed a framework agreement with the Department of War to quadruple THAAD interceptor production from 96 to 400 annually.
- Pentagon concerns about missile threats and interceptor shortages prompted the accelerated production push amid pressure from President [Donald Trump](https://ground.news/interest/donald-trump) and the administration for weapons manufacturing over investor payouts.
- Lockheed will spend billions over the next three years to expand production capacity and modernize more than 20 facilities, breaking ground Thursday on a new Munitions Acceleration Center in Camden, Arkansas.
- Congress must approve funding before a final THAAD production contract is awarded, with the company expecting approval later this year and scaling production over seven years.
- The expansion is expected to generate large numbers of manufacturing and skilled-trade jobs, leveraging Lockheed's dedicated THAAD operations space of more than 340,000 square feet and profit-sharing to reinvest in factories.
