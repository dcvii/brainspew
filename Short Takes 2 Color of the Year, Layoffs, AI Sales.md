### Cloud Dancer | Layoffs Reach 1.17M | Microsoft AI Sales Stall

My second day of Short Takes. Got a pretty positive response on #1.

Are these snippets related? A drab white as 2026 color of the year, layoffs way up, and AI is hard to sell. Hmm. Maybe a foretaste of 2026 downturn?

### Cloud Dancer

Pantone released its color of the year for 2026: Cloud Dancer, which is basically white.

I decided to add it here mostly because of Callie Holterman’s [description](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/style/pantones-2026-color-of-the-year-cloud-dancer.html?unlocked_article_code=1.6E8.c7H7.F1znL7nuI20R&smid=url-share):

> *This white, in particular, strikes me as a little flavorless. It’s the color of cottage cheese and dental floss, of marshmallows and AirPods. It reminds me of the clothes I put on when I’m in a rush and the foods I eat when I have a stomach ache.*

Might be apt. Looks like toilet paper to me.

### AI Is Hard To Sell?

Microsoft shares slid on news of difficulties in getting customers to pay for AI, so much so they’ve adjusted sales quotas:
