1/3 Resigning, a Hanukkah Message: As of today I have resigned from the antisemitism advisory committee at Harvard. Without rehashing all of the obvious reasons that have been endlessly adumbrated online, and with great respect for the members of the committee, the short explanation is that both events on campus and the painfully inadequate testimony reinforced the idea that I cannot make the sort of difference I had hoped.  Still, there are several points worth making. I believe Claudine Gay to be both a kind and thoughtful person.  Most of the students here wish only to get an education and a job, not prosecute ideological agendas, and there are many, many honorable, thoughtful and good people at the institution.  Harvard is still a repository of extraordinary minds and important research.

2/3

However, the system at Harvard along with the ideology that grips far too many of the students and faculty, the ideology that works only along axes of oppression and places Jews as oppressors and therefore intrinsically evil, is itself evil. Ignoring Jewish suffering is

3/3      Battling that combination of ideologies is the work of more than a committee or a single university.  It is not going to be changed by hiring or firing a single person, or posting on X, or yelling at people who don’t post as you wish when you wish, as though posting is

David, a President is called to lead. She has not lead and in fact is a product of the same ideologies you decry. Harvard needs new leadership. She is not going to fix this. We have the tyranny of the kind, decent and inept leftists here in SF. Change is needed.

It is indeed possible for someone to hold Antisemitic views AND still be a generally likable person, just like it is possible for someone to be afraid of spiders and be a generally likable person.

President Gay is likely unaware of her biases as they are subconscious in nature.

Kind and thoughtful, but couldn't take a stand when being questioned.

She's not on our side.

I wish you would not resign. They need your wisdom and clarity. It will take time but surely remaining on the committee will be better for the @Harvard and a reassurance for the Jewish students on campus.

There exists no internally kind person with those views and with the intent to foster a culture of division and hated.

Kindness means loving other people. Niceness means pleasing for a purpose.

The blessing inside this bad news is that you are there to see and speak on our behalf. Thank you for clarity and spine.

Harvard is a cesspool breeding ground for brown shirts. Shame on you.

“I believe Claudine Gay to be both a kind and thoughtful person.”

How obvious could it be that she is neither? Ask Roland Fryer.

Great decision, Harward turned out to be a citadel of the most vile and unrestrained antisemitism.

Thank you. But, I do not believe “Claudine Gay to be both a kind and thoughtful person.”
