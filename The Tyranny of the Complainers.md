Some years ago, [Dourado and Russell](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/dourado-airport-noise-mop-v1.pdf) pointed out a stunning fact about airport noise complaints: A very large number come from a single individual or household.

> In 2015, for example, 6,852 of the 8,760 complaints submitted to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport originated from one residence in the affluent Foxhall neighborhood of northwest Washington, DC. The residents of that particular house called Reagan National to express irritation about aircraft noise an average of almost 19 times per day during 2015.

Since then, total complaint volumes have [exploded](https://www.flydulles.com/sites/flydulles.com/files/2025-06/Final%202024%20annual%20noise%20report%20no%20quarterly%20plots.pdf) —but they are still coming from a tiny number of now apparently more “productive” individuals. In 2024, for example, one individual alone submitted 20,089 complaints, accounting for 25% of all complaints! Indeed, the total number of complainants was only 188 but they complained 79,918 times (an average of 425 per individual or more than one per day.)

[What I learned recently](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1956858751543058689?s=20) is that it’s not just airport noise complaints. We see the same pattern in data from the [US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights](https://www.ed.gov/about/ed-offices/ocr/serial-reports-regarding-ocr-activities) which enforces federal civil rights laws related to education funding. In 2023, for example, 5059 sexual discrimination complaints came from a single individual–from a total of 8151 complaints. Thus, one individual accounted for 68.5% of all sexual discrimination complaints in that year.

In the annual reports for 2022-2024 the OCR identifies what type of complaint the single-individual with multiple complaints was making, a sex discrimination complaint, while in previous years they just give data on the number of complaints from single individuals compared to the total of all types of complaints. I’ve collated this data in this graph which presents totals compared to multiple complaints from a single individual without regard to the type of complaint. Do note, that there are also single individuals filing hundreds of other types of complaints such as age discrimination complaints so the data from more recent years may actually be an underestimate.

In any case, it’s clear that a single individual often accounts for 10-30% of *all* complaints! These complaints have to be investigated so this single individual may be costing taxpayers millions. It’s as if a single individual were pulling a fire alarm thousands of times a year, mobilizing emergency services on demand, and never facing repercussions.

Does this strategy work? Probably. When complaints are summarized for Congress or reported in the media, are totals presented as-is, or adjusted for spam?

Increasingly, public institutions seem to exist to manage the obsessions of a tiny number of neurotic—and possibly malicious—complainers.
