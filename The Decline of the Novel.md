Do you want to read a bestseller? That sounds like fun, no?

Here are the hottest titles right now (according to Amazon):

Do those look tempting?

I was a bit surprised by this. I’d heard that people had stopped having children—but the bestselling books are all for toddlers.

Something doesn’t add up here. Where are all the books for grown-ups?

Here’s the complete top ten from Amazon’s ranking of bestselling books:

1. _Be Brave Little One_ by Marianne Richmond (picture book, 40 pages)
    
2. _How to Catch a Dinosaur_ by Adam Wallace (picture book, 40 pages)
    
3. _Spooky Pookie_ by Sandra Boynton (picture book, 18 pages)
    
4. _How to Catch an Elf_ by Adam Wallace (picture book, 32 pages)
    
5. _The Message_ by Ta-Nehisi Coates (adult non-fiction, 256 pages)
    
6. _Eight Little Planets_ by Chris Ferrie (picture book, 18 pages)
    
7. _I Love You Like No Otter_ by Rose Rossner (picture book, 24 pages)
    
8. _Melania_ by Melania Trump (adult non-fiction, 256 pages)
    
9. _The Millicent Quibb School of Etiquette for Young Ladies of Mad Science_ by Kate McKinnon (young adult fiction, 256 pages)
    
10. _Spooky Cutie_ by Coko Wyo (coloring book, 88 pages)
    

No adult fiction shows up on the list. There’s nothing resembling a grown-up novel until we get to number twenty in Amazon’s ranking, _Onyx Storm_—a fantasy romance by Rebecca Yarros.

As I continue to scroll down the list, I see more of the same. Tiny books for tiny tots take up most of the top 50. I finally find something resembling serious adult fiction at number 42, where Sally Rooney’s new novel _Intermezzo_ resides.

Just stop and mull this over—not a single serious novel made it into the top 40. Zero! Bupkes! This is the literary culture we’ve created for ourselves—and it’s tinier than the toddlers who now set the tone for the book business.

Of course, book reading of all sorts is in decline—[fewer than half of US adults read a book in the last year](https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/responses-to-the-2022-SPPA/a-time-of-hope-and-worry), according to the NEA. But fiction readership has been hurt most of all, falling 17% over the course of a decade.

The result is that 62% of those surveyed read _no fiction whatsoever_—neither novels nor short stories.

> ### “I’ve become self-conscious about reading in public—something I’ve done all my life, but never before with such unease.”

I’ve personally encountered a growing hostility to book-readers in recent years. If you mention a contemporary novel in conversation, you will hear dismissive comments in response—such as:

_You read novels? Who has time for that?_

That seems innocent enough, but the facial expressions that accompany these remarks are unsettling. I can’t help remembering Pol Pot who, when he took over in Cambodia, killed everybody who read books.

Maybe I’m reading too much into the prevailing vibe of brat culture. But the result is that, over time, I’ve become self-conscious about reading in public—something I’ve done all my life, but never before with such unease.

From the stares and passing comments, I can tell that this is considered odd behavior, and inspires distrust in some circles.

The same day I did this survey of bestsellers, _The Atlantic_ published a scorching indictment entitled [“The Elite College Students Who Can’t Read Books.”](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/)

The author talked to 33 professors about the reading skills of college students today—and their verdict is gloomy.

- A Berkeley professor admits that she has cut required reading in half—and no longer expects students to read entire books, just extracts.
    
- A Georgetown professor complains that students lose focus now when reading a sonnet— 14-line poem.
    
- A University of Virginia professor says that students are now “shutting down” when faced with new ideas.
    
- A Columbia professors sums up the crisis: “It’s not that they don’t want to do the reading. It’s that they don’t know how.”
    

An increasing number of elite students arrive on college without ever having read an entire book in high school. When assigned a book per week—typical of college lit classes for decades—many complain the the assignment “feels impossible.”

But the problem starts long before college.

High schools have shifted away from assigning books in recent years. Instead students read short, informational passages—and then discuss the concepts or facts presented.

The goal is to build conceptual and thinking skills, but the end result is alarming. “We’ve sacrificed young people’s ability to grapple with long-form texts in general,” admits Stanford education professor Antero Garcia.

Earlier this week I read about a student complaining to her school board in Connecticut that [she had received a high school diploma without being able to read or write](https://www.the74million.org/article/this-hartford-public-high-school-grad-cant-read-heres-how-it-happened/). She had been a student in district schools since age 6, but couldn’t even read words of one syllable.

I’ve heard disturbing stories like this before, and you probably have too. But here was a new twist—she was on the honor roll at school.

That’s how severe the reading crisis is now. Students can actually flourish in the system while remaining illiterate.

I don’t think it’s a coincidence that these alarming developments have happened during a period in which scrolling and swiping through phone videos has become the great national pastime—surpassing all other forms of media or communication.

Are these just anecdotal accounts? What would most teachers say?

A [survey from](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/how-to-build-students-reading-stamina/2024/01) _[EdWeek](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/how-to-build-students-reading-stamina/2024/01)_answers that question. Teachers of grades 3-8 were surveyed about changes in reading skills among their student compared to five years ago. Here are there responses:

The key problem isn’t vocabulary and comprehension—although those are suffering too. The biggest deficit is an inability to focus. “It’s not just complexity. I can look at a complex text all day long,” [one teacher explained](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/how-to-build-students-reading-stamina/2024/01), “but if I only read three pages at a shot, it’s not building my stamina.”

That’s an odd word to use in a classroom—_stamina._ I tend to think of stamina as something athletes develop, not students holding a book. But the reality is that even smart youngsters can’t apply their intellect for more than a few minutes without losing concentration.

Some teachers have responded by imposing 20-minute reading periods in class, followed by one minute of reflection and writing—which leads into a class discussion. I’m reminded of my high school coaches, who made us run bleachers or do pyramid pushups. Some literary equivalent of that may be needed to prep the next generation for reading an entire book, cover to cover.

Not long ago, bestselling novels sold tens of millions of copies. I read a lot of bestsellers in 8th and 9th grade, and even signed up for the Book of the Month Club. I remember that _The Godfather_ by Mario Puzo was a monthly selection around the time I joined—not a very good novel, and certainly a lesser artistic achievement than the movie version. But it was a thick book that sold more than 20 million copies.

In my parents generation, _Gone With the Wind_ sold more than 30 million copies. That was a thousand-page-plus novel. The cover price was $3—more than some people earned for an entire day’s work back then.

Harry Potter did even better, selling six hundred million books—but that was a last gasp of youth literacy before the rise of phone culture. Nowadays sale at that level would require magic unknown even at Hogwarts. I doubt we will ever have another long novel achieve that degree of popularity, bordering on mania.

By comparison, the new Sally Rooney book got a first printing of 500,000 copies—extremely impressive for contemporary fiction. But in comparison with bestselling novels of the past, that’s nothing to brag about. There was a day when the Book of the Month Club edition alone could generate that level of sales

The painful truth is that novels no longer impact the culture.

Rooney’s first two novels got turned into miniseries, and reached tens of millions of viewers who would never consider reading the original books.

But Rooney refused to sell adaptation rights for her third book. “I felt like it was just time to take a break from that and let the book be its own thing for a while,” she explained.

That attitude shocks pop culture insiders—what kind of fool turns down a movie deal? But I understand exactly how Rooney feels. It’s like Mario Puzo’s situation with _The Godfather_—everybody gives Coppola the credit, and the book gets treated like a screenplay treatment. But the current situation is far more extreme than anything Puzo ever dealt with. Even a brilliant writer can easily lose identity as a novelist and get turned into a supporting member of the film crew.

That, I’m sorry to say, is the actual ‘State of the Novel’ in our post-iPhone era. It’s a way to get a movie deal. End of story.

The books are even written with that in mind. Novels are filled with incidents ready-made for the screen. But all the submerged currents of the inner life are purged from the narrative The psychological novel—the greatest achievement in the history of fiction, in my opinion—is so over. If you can’t show it visually, it doesn’t belong anymore.

I can’t exempt the major publishers from some share of the blame here. They have accepted a lesser role in the culture, ancillary to Hollywood. But, as a result, the novels they publish are increasingly flat and formulaic.

> ### “It’s a way to get a movie deal. End of story.”

Almost every contemporary novel I read now has a major character who is either

1. A teacher in a writing program, or
    
2. A student in a writing program, or
    
3. A graduate of a writing program.
    

The self-referential tone is claustrophobic—you can almost hear the echoes bouncing off the walls of the MFA echo chamber.

It’s not just the narrow range of characters and settings. The tone of these books is also insulated—often in a manner that is sullen or aggrieved or hectoring. In some ways, new fiction resembles stand-up comedy, only with all the humor removed. But the books hold on to the same irritated observational stance—which both complains about elitism while exuding it at every turn.

If you wanted to discourage people from reading novels, this is precisely the kind of book you would publish. It all feels futile and fatalistic. But the major publishers are apparently in agreement that this is how contemporary fiction is supposed to sound.

Maybe they will get all those film and TV adaptations they dream about. But I fear that I’ve seen that movie too many times already.

> ### “The best we can hope for is fiction that reads like Netlix on the page.”

But one thing is certain. We’ve come a long way since Flaubert and Balzac and Tolstoy. I think I can say with some confidence that if a young writer wrote ambitious works of psychological depth in the tradition of Dostoevsky, Woolf, Proust, or late-period Henry James, they would get nowhere in today’s publishing house of mirrors.

So the best we can hope for is fiction that read like Netflix on the page.

That’s the ugly state of the novel in the current moment. People won’t read ‘em. People can’t read ‘em. And even if they do, they resemble something a streaming service might serve up on their phones or TV screens.

I won’t even touch the larger question. But I will mention it. Here it is:

> **Can you have a rich inner life yourself, if all the stories in your life only operate at the surface level?**

That’s a subject for a different day. But don’t think for one moment that this is a trivial matter. In other words, the crisis is larger than just the schools, or the publishing industry.

Stories hold societies together. To some extent, they hold people together.

That was true in Homer’s day and it’s still true today. If the stories collapse, all the king’s software and digital devices won’t even begin to put us together again.
