Why we are excited about confession! — LessWrong

[^1]: Originally I was going to use the Nigerian explanation for the "delve" example but **NEVER MIND I GOT CLAUDE TO LOOK THAT UP AND IT'S JUST ALL MADE UP! THE GUARDIAN ARTICLE WHICH STARTED IT ONLY INTERVIEWED PEOPLE FROM KENYA AND UGANDA, THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY EVIDENCE THAT ANY PARTICULAR ENGLISH VERSION CONTAINS THE SAME WORDS THAT LLMS LOVE TO USE.**

[^3]: The analogy being between truth:simulator::good-relationship-advice:redditor-simulator. Giving good relationship advice is probably rewarded maybe 80% of the time, but giving an exact simulation of what a redditor would say about a relationship advice is rewarded 100% of the time. Overall, the LLM learns to become a redditor-simulator rather than a good relationship advice giver.
