## Joshua Jahn

#### Investigators piece together background of Joshua Jahn

A 29-year-old man with ties to North Texas and Oklahoma has been identified as the suspect in a Dallas ICE detention center shooting. According to FOX News and FOX 4 sources, the sniper who killed at least one person at the Dallas ICE facility early Wednesday morning was 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.

What we know:

According to FOX News and FOX 4 sources, the sniper who killed at least one person at the Dallas ICE facility early Wednesday morning was 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.

Records show he has family in the Collin County city of Fairview. Dallas police confirmed that Fairview police are assisting with their investigation.

SKY 4 captured images of FBI agents outside that home on Wednesday afternoon and FOX 4 reporters saw what appeared to be frantic family members.

Federal investigators were seen removing a box of possible evidence from the home.

What they're saying:

Sloane Mordecai, a neighbor, had no idea about the attack until she drove upon reporters down the street — and federal agents next door.

"That’s insane to hear," said Mordecai.

"Like I said, very sweet family, so that was really, really surprising to hear."

It took a while for Tim Johnson to learn that he lives down the street from the Fairview home connected to Jahn. He says he only knew of Jahn and no personal details.

"You think just how crazy that is and how close it is to home now," said Johnson.

"But it’s an unfortunate event."

Dig deeper:

Records indicate Jahn most recently lived in Durant, Oklahoma.

"That’s what we are looking into," Chief David Comeaux told FOX 4.

Law enforcement officials were seen parked outside a home connected to Jahn in Durant on Wednesday afternoon. Video shows the FBI and SWAT focusing in on that listed address, but no word as to what was recovered.

A spokesperson for Collin College in McKinney, Texas told the Associated Press that someone named Joshua Jahn took classes at "various times" between 2013 and 2018.

The AP reports that in late 2017, he worked harvesting legal marijuana from a farm in Washington state.

What we don't know:

There's still no word on a motive for the shooting.

## Criminal Background

Joshua Jahn (2015)

FOX 4 could not find any history of violent crime on Jahn's record.

He does not appear to have a violent criminal history, but in 2015 he was arrested for marijuana possession in Collin County.

## Dallas ICE Shooting

The shooting happened around 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday at the Dallas ICE facility located on North Stemmons Freeway.

A gunman shot three ICE detainees. One of those detainees died, and the two others are in critical condition.

Police sources told FOX 4 the sniper was armed with a rifle on a nearby roof. He shot himself as agents approached him, the sources said.

Dallas FBI Field Office Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock confirmed the incident is being investigated as active, targeted violence.

He also said rounds found near the shooter contained messages that were anti-ICE in nature.

Federal investigators have not said what may have led Jahn to develop reported anti-ICE views, or if there’s any other evidence beyond what was written on shell casings found at the Dallas facility.

A sign on a car that reportedly belonged to the shooter reads, "Radioactive fallout from nuclear formations that've passed over these areas more than 2x since 1951."
