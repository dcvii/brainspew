### BREAKING: May 21, 2025

Mooch chats with Stefano Ritondale, the Chief Intelligence Officer for Artorius, focusing on open-source intelligence using an approach that capitalizes on AI-driven data to dissect the operational frameworks of Mexican cartels. His work with Artorius complements his role as the mind behind *[All Source News](https://x.com/All_Source_News)*, where he delves into the influence and operations of cartels, particularly focusing on their social media strategies.

Within the past few years, Ritondale has gained recognition for his work on the social media operations of cartels like Mexico's infamous Sinaloa and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). His research shows how these cartels are not just drug runners but vast, multinational corporations with diverse portfolios. From avocados to lime, fuel theft to human smuggling, their reach extends into legitimate businesses, complicating international commerce and security.

Ritondale gives deep intel on the recent alliance between factions of the Sinaloa cartel—Los Chapitos, the sons of El Chapo Guzmán—and the CJNG. This coalition shifts the power dynamics within Mexico's criminal landscape, potentially recalibrating the efforts of U.S. military and intelligence operations. Alliances like these highlight the ever-changing nature of cartel politics and underscore the complexity of addressing these threats.
