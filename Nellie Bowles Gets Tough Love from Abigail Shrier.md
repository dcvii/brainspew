Dear Abigail,

I’m finding myself overwhelmed with anxiety about the news—and it’s getting in the way of making decisions. I worry about where things are going. I worry about the various political rages. About the extremes that threaten my nice, peaceful life. Calm, sober people I know are talking about coming up with backup plans. I worry about AI causing widespread psychosis, and I worry about masses of unemployed white-collar workers starting a violent revolution (I’m totally serious). And I’m feeling anxious about making any long-term plans because of it.

My instinct is to live as lightly as possible so I can be nimble. If I’m honest, this has always been a problem of mine to some extent. Like, when we moved to New York, I didn’t want to have to buy furniture and commit to a new place, so we signed onto a two-year furnished sublet. This all has downstream effects: We have a 3-year-old and a 1-year-old. I know stability is essential for them. And if I’m really, really honest, I grew up in a family with some instability, so I worry that I’m recreating that by refusing to commit to a long-term home.

But I genuinely, in my bones, think chaos is coming. What do I do? How do I build a stable life when I’m convinced we need to be ready to run? — Love, Your Friend in Need, Nellie

Nellie,

In the ’90s, the most popular driver’s ed class in Potomac, Maryland, was taught by a thirtysomething named Paul. My classmates raved about him and, though I lived nowhere near Potomac, I begged my parents to be allowed to enroll.

What made Paul a fan favorite had less to do with substance than style, which amounted to “No B.S.” He wore coffee-stained T-shirts under rumpled, unbuttoned Oxfords and jeans sprung out at the knees. He always seemed to be jonesing for a cigarette, and gave us driving instructions in the manner of someone leveling with us—of finally letting high school kids in on life’s secrets.

He told us that if a dog ran in front of your car, you needed to run it over. Better to kill a dog than swerve onto the sidewalk and kill a kid, he said. We accepted this news with shocked solemnity. If we wanted to be worthy of a driver’s license, we needed to be ready to hit some dogs.

The lesson I remember best had to do with driving in a snowstorm with limited visibility. Snow was no joke, Paul said. You get snow and ice under your tires, especially on a turn, and you can start to fishtail and spin out. Everything inside you is going to want to hit the brakes. But braking would cause your tires to lose contact with the road. Your car will fly across the ice like a hockey puck.

The key was to let the tires run so that they could regain traction. Don’t touch that brake. Steer gently into the skid. Keep your eyes focused on where you want the car to go.

Your letter, dear Nellie, made me think of Paul’s lesson, and of sliding on ice in a darkening landscape. We expect to feel purchase under our tires, but we can’t manage to get traction, can’t stop the rising panic at the numberless things beyond our control.

You mention the AI comet that seems to be hurtling toward us and the social upheaval it may produce. It’s becoming harder even to contemplate what the future will look like. Record numbers of young people say they do not intend to have children. Record numbers of high school girls are no longer interested in ever getting married at all. Perhaps like you, Nellie, they want to stay “nimble.” Too much attachment makes them feel limited and uneasy.

Recently, New York Mayor Eric Adams offered this ominous warning, apparently referring to what life would be like under his replacement: “If I was a Jewish New Yorker with children, I would be concerned right now.” In case Jewish New Yorkers weren’t already packing their bags, Adams repeated the warning a second time.

*How can we invest in a society that seems to be in precipitous decline?* That’s what I think you’re asking. *Is it foolish to commit to a culture that seems to be falling apart?* Doesn’t it make more sense to hover near the door than to take off your coat, grab a drink, and enjoy the party? But, much like stomping on the brakes in a skid, it would be a mistake.

Ever notice that a peculiar sadness inheres in plastic forks and paper plates? No one ever settles into a folding chair, no matter how sturdy. Couples who live together for years, telling themselves that they’re as good as married, rarely seem to believe it. The fact is, you don’t really tuck into a meal on squeaky Styrofoam. “My girlfriend” neither carries the ring nor commands the respect of “my wife.” Impermanence alienates and unnerves us.

When you signal to people in your life that you have one foot out the door, they will edge away. They will un-invest in *you.* And your children will feel your hesitation too.

Ultimately, it’s your relationships that will give you and your children security in a world that’s teetering.

Let’s say you walk your kids to school every day, get to know their teachers, truck the kids across the city to see old friends, get to know their classmates’ parents, embed yourself in religious community.

What if that still isn’t enough? What if you end up changing schools, moving neighborhoods, or having to leave the city?

Here’s the thing: That time spent won’t evaporate into the ether. It will remain locked in your kids’ memories—the places and people they knew when they were small.

About a year ago, I was having lunch with a young cousin who’s currently a college student. I had grown up with his mother but didn’t know him well. He asked me all sorts of questions. Since he plans to apply to law school, he asked me about that too: what I thought of my clerkship and whether I had been tempted to apply to the Supreme Court.

I really hadn’t considered it, I explained. For one, I had already started dating the guy I would eventually marry. I was making plans to follow that guy to California. I told my young cousin this, assuming that answered his question.

He took this all in for a beat. Then, he said: “And do you regret that decision?”

I nearly laughed out loud. But he wasn’t kidding. He genuinely wanted to know whether I hadn’t considered the failure to pursue another professional opportunity a great loss. He had surveyed my life and read it as a series of purchases you couldn’t return: the husband, the house, the three kids, the community.

He doesn’t know—and how could he?—that keeping yourself “nimble” so that you can always be “ready to run” is no recipe for a life well lived. A life of take-out meals and disposable goods more reliably produces agita than relief. You don’t want to die with your options open.

I have now lived in California longer than I have anywhere else, and yet thoughts of my childhood and adolescence in Maryland still hit me with bouts of longing. Paul’s advice about driving in snow, years later, caught in an unseasonable storm, would save my life. None of it feels like wasted time.

Overinvest, never underinvest, in people around you and in those you love. Particularly in a world with poor visibility, they are the closest thing any of us has to security. Give the community you inhabit a real shot and make a go of ensuring it succeeds.

If crime skyrockets, if you must leave the city, if our great civilization goes bust, you won’t regret the time you spent taking your kids and their friends out for ice cream. You’ll all carry with you memories that will bolster you wherever you go. Do all these things right up until the very moment you decide to make a change.

Here is the tough love you requested: You won’t regret having wholeheartedly invested in your home and community for as long as they are yours. I can almost guarantee, at the end of your journey, you won’t lament, “Civilization collapsed. I needed to flee. And meanwhile, I’d just bought this damn sofa.”

Onward,  
Abigail
