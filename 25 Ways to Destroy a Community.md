Let’s do an experiment.

Let’s imagine that your goal is to destroy a community. You want to keep people isolated, and without any connection to a larger social fabric. You want them depressed, and lacking purpose. That makes them easier to control and manipulate.

It isn’t easy to do.

People exist in a web of relationships—they are embedded in a society with deep emotional ties. They have traditions, dozens (or hundreds) of personal connections, and an instinctive desire to be part of a larger group. They want their lives to have meaning.

It’s hard to destroy all that. Even the most tyrannical dictators have failed at it.

But even if it sounds like *Mission Impossible*, it’s still your job. So how do you do it?

Let me share the ultimate game plan for achieving this impossible goal. Below I describe the destruction of a community in 25 steps. If you can pull all this off (or even most of it), you will have forced the citizens into a closed, isolated life.

They will be helpless and alone.

And then just imagine that all these things might already be happening. Even worse, powerful people and institutions seem to be working daily to create this destruction.

Here it is—25 steps to a closed, meaningless, isolated life.

1. Convince people to cut off ties to their family, and avoid creating new families of their own—so you must also convince them to stop marrying and having children.
2. Make it difficult to have romantic relationships of any sort. If possible, reduce dating and even sexual encounters. Any kind of intimacy must be discouraged. Of course, the ultimate goal is to create a “war of the sexes” so that men and women view each other with anger and hostility.
3. Create a culture of staying at home and staring into screens. All kinds of nightlife, communal entertainment, and partying must be discouraged.
4. Replace the workplace with remote work. Don’t let people connect with colleagues and develop a vibrant community of peers.
5. Do everything you can to destroy people’s trust in democracy. This will increase apathy and disconnection. They will eventually embrace tyrannical authorities out of sheer desperation or just indifference.
6. Whenever possible, replace social activities with apps. Force people to interact with screens instead of each other in every phase of their life.
7. You can isolate people even more if you convince them to stop driving cars and never even get a driver’s license. But to make this work, you also need to stop investing in public transportation of all sorts. People will now stay at home because they won’t have any other options.
8. Get people to stop reading books or even articles. It’s easier to do this if you never teach them adequate reading skills in the first place.
9. Get people to replace reading with scrolling of short, stupid videos. If possible, make this an addictive process—so that the citizens waste hours every day at this.
10. Replace team sports and athletics with watching sports—or, even better, online gambling on sports. Teamwork of any sort must be discouraged.
11. Physical fitness and nutrition must also be discouraged. Defund youth sports. Fill up foods with hyper-processed ingredients. Weak people don’t rebel and will do what they’re told.
12. Teach people to connect with the outside world via an AI chatbot and AI agents. They can now go through an entire day without dealing with a single flesh-and-blood person.
13. The more people rely on AI, the less they think for themselves. This avoidance of thought must be implemented at every opportunity.
14. Decriminalize drug use—people can now get intoxicated without going to a party or nightclub or any social situation whatsoever. If they stay at home and get stoned they won’t put up any resistance.
15. Replace social contact with social media. If you achieve this, even socializing becomes an isolating experience.
16. Promote a culture of hate and antagonism. Attack anyone who encourages cooperation or any kind of social harmony.
17. Encourage violence—or, at a minimum, tolerate it. Anything that makes people fearful of each other will increase their isolation.
18. Get people worked up about canceling each other, even if they have to dig up incidents that happened decades ago. That way they won’t go after the people who have actual power today.
19. Whenever possible, replace people with robots.
20. Flood the market with AI music, images, videos, etc.—so that even art is dehumanized and feels worthless.
21. Tell people that there is no higher purpose or meaning in life. Even better, teach this at college and give it a fancy name (Deconstruction or Post-Modernism or Post-Humanism or whatever). Create the illusion that smart people lead Postmodern (hence meaningless) lives. The ideal, of course, is for college to abandon the Humanities entirely—otherwise people start caring about humans.
22. Let’s be honest, any sort of advanced education is dangerous, because people might start thinking for themselves. So make college ridiculously expensive and ensure that most of the classes are pointless. Young people will soon decide that their careers will be enhanced by skipping it entirely.
23. Convince people that the most important thing in life is money. Everything else must be sacrificed for money—and the material goods it buys. No one will ask how you got it, so just grab all the cash you can.
24. Increase surveillance of all people—not just criminals or suspects—so that you can immediately identify and punish individuals who break out of their isolation and try to disrupt the power structure in any way.
25. Find ways of silencing or censoring or shadowbanning people who speak truth to power. Take away the whistle from whistleblowers. If you punish this behavior with sufficient severity, most people will stay quiet and do what they’re told.

By now, you might have noticed something that’s very disturbing. Yes, all these things are *already happening*. That’s almost impossible to believe, but it’s true.

And most of this has taken place in just a few years. A decade ago, I couldn’t have imagined this. Could you really convince people to stop partying and having sex? Could you get everybody to stay home alone? But that’s exactly what they’re doing.

And it gets worse. [Here’s how Substacker Jay Lesoleil describes it](https://substack.com/@jaylesoleil/note/c-171551340):

> You feel depressed and crazy because in every historical human culture known to anthropology people sang together, danced together and ate food together, and you don’t sing and you don’t dance and you eat alone in the dark.

So even our creative culture gets degraded. Singing, dancing, storytelling—these were things everybody did together. Now they are reduced to digital *content*. They are something to scroll through on a screen for distraction.

How did we get here? Do we really want to live like this?

This is the brutal reality: We have created a monstrous society in which people live a closed life—almost entirely alone and isolated, without any hope of connection. It almost feels demonic.

But all the evidence shows that people have willingly embraced these things. That said, corporations and powerful people have worked hard, like the junior devil Wormwood, to prod and promote the public’s self-abasement.

Those companies and people deserve our blame. The damage they have done is irreparable. They ought to pay some fine, or undergo some punishment—but, at a minimum, they must be stopped. To continue down this path into the totally closed life is insanity.

Maybe we should do a different experiment next time. We can come up with a 20-step game plan for creating a connected life.

That’s always harder—it’s easier to destroy than to create. But strengthening the community is now a necessity, and we don’t have time to waste. Wouldn’t it be great if those huge corporations and powerful leaders helped us rebuild what they have worked so hard to undermine?
