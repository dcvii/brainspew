Here's a chart of interest rates over seven centuries.  
  
But something stands out: Where are all the Jewish loans?  
  
Jews have had a reputation for making loans for centuries, but this analysis explicitly omits them. The reason is simple: Jewish loans were different.  
  
Short🧵

In the premodern world, religious restrictions on moneylending abounded.  
  
Since states were weak and Christians had no ability to charge usurious rates, Christian finance was handicapped. So the enterprise came to be dominated by Jews, who weren't similarly restricted.

Rulers were not unaware of this. In fact, they regularly made attempts to attract Jews to their towns and cities.  
  
Sometimes town representatives would even beseech their lords to let them bring Jews to their towns because, TL;DR: 'think of the poor people!'

But once Jews were permitted into towns, the scale of their lending wasn't kept to the poor who needed a means of obtaining quick cash.  
  
Quite the contrary: large percentages of the population borrowed from Jews!

Another way we know Jewish moneylending was common is the fact that just as there's a Chancellor of the Exchequer today, there used to also just be an Exchequer of the Jews.

The Exchequer of the Jewry had a vested interest in the continuance and development of the Jewish monopoly on moneylending in England.  
  
The presence of Jewish credit was what allowed the king to credibly transact with parties outside of his feudal realm, so they were protected:

Jewish moneylending was needed for markets to work, it was desired by traders and rulers alike, and it was commonly used by all strata of the population.  
  
So how high were the rates? Well, that depended on where you lived and the charters in place. Charters were commonplace:

Charters regulated what Jews were allowed to do across Europe, and a major thing they regulated was moneylending.  
  
For example, in Tirol, the charter enacted by Friedrich IV placed the maximum rate at 64.5%.

Rates varied by the town, and some rates even had progressive ceilings.

Rates were likely higher in northern than southern Europe.  
  
This makes sense, because in northern Europe, there were fewer Lombards who could substitute for Jewish moneylenders.

From various accounts, it seems Jews charged much higher rates than the practically inter-governmental rates rulers sometimes secured.  
  
The interest rate felt by non-governmental entities, non-nobles, small loan recipients, etc. was likely far higher than what's in that chart.

Stalin sent millions of people to the Gulag.  
  
Among them were the "Enemies of the people"—the bourgeois educated elite.  
  
Despite having everything taken from them, their descendants are more educated than their peers today.  
  
Short🧵

The economic benefits of having these immiserated intellectuals' descendants in an area today are visible in other ways.  
  
For example, a one standard deviation increase in an area's "Enemies of the people" comes with 65% higher profits per employee and 22% higher average wages.

In 2021, the Council of Economic Advisers wrote up a brief report on the need to build more houses.  
  
The first thing they noted was the obvious: that housing supply and prices are mirror images of one another, so worse supply, higher prices.

The next thing they noted was that, since the end of the 1960s, population growth has outpaced housing supply growth.  
  
This has made it less affordable to acquire a home.

Then they noted that one of the issues here is construction preferences: people still want single-family homes.  
  
Since they also want to live in dense, urban areas, we need to transition from single-family to greater numbers of units.

Have you ever wanted one page that tells you where Americans have come from over America's whole history?  
  
I just wrote it!  
  
Here's how the U.S. population looked prior to when it began collecting immigration statistics:

Immigration statistics began being formally collected with the passage of the Steerage Act in 1819.  
  
Between then and the passage of the Immigration Act of 1882, here's where immigrants came from:

China has been trying to get young people to player fewer video games for years.  
  
In 2019, they tried to limit players under 18 years of age to 1.5 hours of daily play. Did that work?  
  
The answer seems to be "No".  
  
First, look at total playtime before (red) and after (cyan).

The dataset used here is massive and included 2,486,192,234 unique gamer profiles.  
  
Here's how things look for the percentage of people involved in heavy play (i.e., <4 hours per day, 6 days per week).

Here's the odds of heavy play before and after China's regulation went into place across 50 different countries from another of these authors' datasets.  
  
China doesn't look exceptional at all!

Kids from more deprived neighborhoods tend to have lower GPAs.  
  
But is it because their neighborhood is impacting their learning?  
  
Probably not!  
  
Within families, the effect of neighborhood deprivation on student GPAs is nullified.

This large dataset obviously has data on siblings, so the exposure differences between them can be used to quantify the contributions of things like neighborhoods, schools, families, and more to student GPAs.  
  
The result?  
  
Well, not much neighborhood or school effect.

There are some other interesting details in here, like that the birth order effect seems to be suppressed between families, but it does show up within families, like with fertility and income.  
  
Also, students with foreign backgrounds seem to have higher GPAs.

The Jewish Departure and Expulsion Memorial From Arab Lands and Iran reads  
  
"With the birth of the State of Israel, over 850,000 Jews were forced from Arab Lands and Iran. The desperate refugees were welcomed by Israel."  
  
Here are their populations over time:

As you can tell, these Jews were a major source of Israel's early immigrants, and they composed a large part of the "Other" category in this graph I posted earlier:

There's also more to note.

Firstly, the speed with which this happened is pretty marked. In 1920, Baghdad might've been a quarter Jewish. Tripoli in 1941 was. The expulsion of Jews in Libya was finalized under Muamar Gaddafi.
