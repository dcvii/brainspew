***Welcome to Things Worth Remembering, our weekly column in which writers share a poem or paragraph that all of us should commit to heart. This week, Douglas Century marks International Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27 with a reflection on “Eli, Eli,” a poem sung by millions to honor the murdered—and on the story of the brave young woman who wrote it.***

It was a scorching afternoon in late July 2023, and I was wandering through the deserted ruins of Caesarea, the ancient Roman capital of Judaea—today, a [stunning national park](https://en.parks.org.il/reserve-park/caesarea-national-park/) in Israel. As I walked, I recited a poem: that of a young woman who had been executed by a firing squad nearly 80 years earlier, during the Holocaust.

Her name was Hannah Senesh, and she spent her early adult years in the very area I was walking. As a young woman, she wrote poems inspired by the beauty of her new home. Her most famous poem, written in 1942 when she was 21, is called “Halicha L’Keisarya” in Hebrew—or, in English, “A Walk to Caesarea.” Here it is in English:

> My God, my God, I pray that these things never end,  
> The sand and the sea,  
> The rush of the water,  
> The crash of the heavens  
> The prayer of Man.

The poem is now almost universally known as “Eli, Eli,” or “My God, My God.” That’s largely attributable to the work of composer [David Zehavi](https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/zehavi-david), who set it to music in 1945. Today, it is considered an unofficial second Israeli national anthem and the song most associated with [Yom HaShoah](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ushmm.org/remember/days-of-remembrance/resources/calendar__;!!MbTiNj2pbBzljg!PzNfF0l51r51veVlbOdU_k9VxSm1e4RKFgSbYahXewVsJyXyCAgYGCwHQHdj4R08EzGD12iQQo_DFhkbVCK-jQ09AqxHNWMv$), the nation’s Holocaust remembrance day. Virtually all Israelis—and many Jews in America—know it by heart, and myriad artists have recorded and performed it, ranging from Israel’s first pop superstar, [Ofra Haza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wPDGtmTJ6U&t=1s), to the [Israel Philharmonic Orchestra](https://youtu.be/T4XmNuqhjWQ?si=8g7nQze8RKdIZMfP), to Canadian jazz singer [Sophie Milman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=G6GA7Rmk4p8wl9p6&v=lHAhqfoOHFs&feature=youtu.be).

But “Eli, Eli” takes on special resonance both on Yom HaShoah and [International Holocaust Remembrance Day](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ushmm.org/remember/international-holocaust-remembrance-day__;!!MbTiNj2pbBzljg!PzNfF0l51r51veVlbOdU_k9VxSm1e4RKFgSbYahXewVsJyXyCAgYGCwHQHdj4R08EzGD12iQQo_DFhkbVCK-jQ09ArWCwc5v$) —for on thesedays, every year, millions worldwide sing Hannah’s words. Two years ago, for example, members of the Ukrainian military chorus gave an astonishing rendition [at Babyn Yar](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/youtu.be/s-JOO5jePXM?si=qytQXhRCyFiqWsDc__;!!MbTiNj2pbBzljg!JT0xBtHy3vq6uP5DZxCeK4w0va-2GnPeU4tgeACE4AFtm44iCvbRXK4qz5jADr4rukT8dUTa9mCe14Hx1jrSutQ$), the site of one of the largest massacres of World War II.

Yet, reading her words, it’s clear the poem is neither a liturgical lament nor the apotheosis for some vast collective Jewish suffering. It’s simply a celebration of the natural world’s awe-inspiring and ever-changing beauty; of one 21-year-old woman’s fleeting instant of happiness; and primarily a reminder—to *herself* —to live in the present moment.

How then did “Eli, Eli” become the song most synonymous with Holocaust Remembrance Day?

The answer is intimately tied to Hannah’s story. Born in Hungary in 1921, Hannah immigrated to Israel—then the British Mandate for Palestine—at 18 and lived on a kibbutz near the Mediterranean Sea. When World War II broke out, Hannah, alongside many other Jews in Mandatory Palestine, volunteered to fight in Europe. She was trained as a paratrooper, and on the moonlit night of March 13, 1944, she parachuted into the mountains of Yugoslavia as part of a top-secret rescue mission. For three months, she fought alongside the anti-Axis resistance movement in Yugoslavia, then crossed into Nazi-occupied Hungary in June 1944, where she was almost immediately captured. After months of torture by the Gestapo and Hungarian police, during which she refused to divulge Allied information, she was convicted of treason by a Hungarian military tribunal, and executed on the frigid morning of November 7, 1944.

She could have saved herself. All she had to do was ask the military prosecutor for a pardon. Instead, she said: “I won’t beg from hangmen and murderers.” She then refused the customary blindfold, forcing the three rifle-toting Hungarian soldiers to look her squarely in the eyes as they fired.

The story of her martyrdom spread quickly in [the Yishuv](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-studies-an-anthology-the-yishuv) —the Jewish community in British Mandatory Palestine. A new cultural mythology, with a new pantheon of heroes, was needed for the soon-to-be born nation.

Then, in 1945, a collection of Hannah’s poems and selected diary entries was published for the first time. It was as if a collective spiritual transformation occurred. “Hannah became a consecrated image in her people’s memory,” wrote [Abba Eban](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abba-Eban), a South African–born Israeli diplomat, politician, and author. “A whole generation came to see her as the symbol of a vast martyrdom. The personal symbol was necessary precisely because the Jewish bereavement is quite incomprehensible when its dimensions are measured in six million. It comes far more within the scope of perception when it is distilled into a single life and death.”

But Hannah’s martyrdom isn’t the only reason “Eli, Eli” resonates so strongly. She wrote it in Hebrew, a language she’d only started learning at age 17 when—in the face of Hungary’s stringent anti-Jewish legislation—she embraced Zionism. After moving to British Mandatory Palestine, she fretted in her diary about her fledgling attempts at literature in the new language. “Hebrew has become part of me,” she noted in April 1940. “I write it easily now—thoughincorrectly.”

Indeed, in [the handwritten manuscript](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hannah-senesh-archives-including-handwritten-poems-come-to-national-library/) of “Eli, Eli,” Hannah misspells the final word in the opening line,using the wrong Hebrew vowel. She had meant to say “never-ending,” but instead wrote a word referring to “hall.” Her true intention, of course, is clear to any reader. But it’s hard not to feel that this everyday imperfection only heightens the charm of both the poem and its young author.

The most ironic aspect about the poem’s afterlife, however, is surely its religious resonance. The musical adaptation of “Eli, Eli” has become a part of modern liturgy, included in the Shabbat prayer book of Reform Judaism and sung regularly in hundreds of synagogues across the world.

And yet Hannah was a secular Jew, raised in a culturally Jewish but not particularly observant home in Budapest. And when she wrote the poem at 21, marveling at the beautiful seascape at Caesarea, she used the phrase “my God” only once, and in the same way that we would conversationally say “Wow!”—or the same way my Gen-Z daughter might text *OMG!!!*

When Zehavi set her lines to music, he not only corrected Hannah’s spelling but chose to double her opening word, changing both the poem’s meter and its meaning. “Eli, Eli” is, after all, an allusion to the opening of [Psalm 22](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.22.1?lang=bi): *Eli, Eli, lama azavtani?* (My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?)

That lament, originally attributed to King David, is famously repeated by Jesus Christ in the ninth hour from the cross. Which is why, for millions of Jews and non-Jews around the world, this duplicative use of “My God” is *precisely* what gives Hannah’s poem such power—striking a deep subconscious chord in anyone familiar with the Book of Psalms and Gospels of Matthew and Mark.

And not only in them. For years, while researching and writing my new book about Hannah, *[Crash of the Heavens](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781668035276)*, I’ve encountered many people with personal connections to her. A Canadian friend reminded me that she had portrayed Hannah in one of our elementary school plays, before promptly and perfectly reciting Hannah’s poem. An Argentinian Jewish friend showed me pictures of herself dressed as Hannah for Purim about 10 years ago. [Gilli Messer](https://www.gillimesser.com/), the Los Angeles-based actor who narrated the audiobook edition of my book, told me that she not only idolized Hannah Senesh as a girl, but that she had sung “Eli, Eli” at her own bat mitzvah.

To date, Hannah’s diary and poems have been translated into more than 20 languages. I see her poems frequently online as inspirational quotes, set free from the fetters of religion and nationalism, or adapted by gifted visual artists for [posters](https://voices-visions.org/content/poster/collection-poster-hannah-senesh-rosalyn-schanzer) and [greeting cards](https://www.rlmartstudio.com/product/there-are-stars/).

In his 2004 book, *[Why Courage Matters](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781588363329)*, Senator John McCain devoted an entire chapter to Hannah: “I don’t think Hannah wanted to die for the sake of having her memory exalted in history or to prove herself equal to a romantic image she conceived for herself,” he wrote. “Her purpose wasn’t to die. She died for her life’s purpose.”

Hannah’s own words confirm McCain’s assessment. “I don’t want to die,” she told her comrades around a roaring bonfire in Slovenia in May 1944, when she had decided that she needed to make the dangerous solo crossing into Hungary. “Of course not. I want to live. I still expect a lot from life.” But, she added, “I need to repurchasemy right to life.”

The kind of moral clarity that Hannah Senesh exhibited—the courage to risk her life for a righteous cause—is the primary reason her legacy and words are so revered today.

And that bravery imbues her most famous poem with an ineffable power: five short lines, jotted down with [perfect imperfection](https://einzelganger.co/wabi-sabi-a-japanese-philosophy-of-perfect-imperfection/) by a 21-year-old Hungarian kibbutznik—simple words, written in an ancient language she had hardly mastered, about embracing a fleeting moment of natural beauty.
