The vice mayor of Cudahy is being called “despicable” by a federal agency, and a police union is demanding that she resign and face prosecution after [appearing to call on street gangs to organize](https://www.whittierdailynews.com/2025/06/24/feds-probing-cudahy-vice-mayor-over-video-urging-gangs-to-combat-ice/) in the face of by federal agents in and around Los Angeles.

And federal law enforcement is also investigating her, according to a media report.

In [a video post](https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1937577489099878740) on social media that’s since been deleted, Cynthia Gonzalez, vice mayor of Cudahy, said, “I want to know where all the cholos are at in Los Angeles.”

“You guys are always tagging everything up, claiming hood, and now that your hood’s being invaded by the biggest gang there is, there ain’t a peep out of you,” Gonzalez said.

She further referenced “18th Street” and “Florence,” two infamous street gangs, and questioned why gang members were not protesting or speaking up about the immigration raids.

“We’re out there fighting our turf, protecting our turf, protecting our people and, like, where you at?” she said.

The video comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has aggressively stepped up immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area in recent weeks. Agents from ICE, as well as Border Patrol, have been seen arresting and detaining people at their workplaces, and Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines to protect federal buildings and guard officers making arrests.

The Department of Homeland Security called Gonzalez’s comments “despicable.”

“She calls for criminal gangs — including the vicious 18th street gang — to commit violence against our brave U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement law enforcement,” the department said in a post on X that included Gonzalez’s video. “This kind of garbage has led to a more than 500% increase in assaults against our U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement law enforcement officers. Secretary Noem has been clear: If you assault a federal officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

The Los Angeles Police Protective League sharply criticized Gonzalez, calling for her resignation and prosecution.

“The 18th Street and Florencia street gangs are notoriously dangerous Los Angeles-based criminal enterprises. They rule their ‘turfs’ through intimidation, violence, and murder, and finance their operations through the sale of narcotics and illegal firearms, prostitution, and protection rackets,” said a letter from the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles Police Protective League.

“Both gangs have a known history of murdering police officers. In 1998, an 18th Street gang member murdered LAPD Officer Filberto Cuesta. Recently, several Florencia gang members were convicted of the 2022 murder of LAPD Officer Fernando Arroyos. In 2001, it was reported that 18th Street put a bounty for the wounding or murder of Los Angeles Police Officers,” the letter continued.

“What Ms. Gonzalez urged and taunted these specific gangs to do in her social media post puts police officers and other law enforcement professionals at greater risk. Her actions are deplorable and potentially illegal. She should resign and she should be prosecuted if what she called for broke the law.”

Gonzalez, who is running for a seat on the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, Fox News’ Bill Melugin, who obtained and re-posted Gonzalez’s video, is reporting that federal sources have confirmed that an investigation is underway. Gonzalez also appeared to confirm the investigation with a Facebook post in which she wrote, “I need a lawyer. The FBI just came to my house. If anyone wants to support please DM me.”

According to her biography on the city of Cudahy’s website, Gonzalez grew up in nearby Huntington Park, the daughter of immigrant parents. She has two daughters.

She received a bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara. She later earned two master’s degrees in education from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she also earned an educational leadership doctorate, the website said.

Gonzalez has worked for the Los Angeles Unified School District as a teacher and school principal in the LA area and is currently the director of pilot schools support and innovation, the biography said.

It says Gonzalez “is passionate about creating healthy and safe communities that allow students and families to lead healthy and meaningful lives.”

The school district said in an emailed statement, “As of June 1, 2025, Cynthia Gonzales has been on a leave of absence. We are aware of the situation and are looking into it in accordance with district policy. However, due to the confidentiality of personnel matters, we are unable to further comment on this.”

The city of Cudahy said in a statement Tuesday it was aware of the video.

“The comments made by the Vice Mayor reflect her personal views and do not represent the views or official position of the City of Cudahy,” the statement read. “The City will not be providing further comment.”

Cudahy is home to 22,000 residents about 10 miles south of downtown LA. According to U.S. Census data, 97% of residents are of Hispanic heritage.
