***Last night, the once unimaginable happened: New York City elected a socialist as mayor. Zohran Mamdani is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, an organization [dedicated to](https://www.dsausa.org/strategy/where_we_stand/) “transforming the power relations of global capitalism.” Mamdani’s victory, and the momentum of progressive Democrats, is the latest sign that another profound shift in our politics could be underway.***

***How did we get here?***

***According to Coleman Hughes, you can’t answer that question without reading Thomas Sowell.***

***Sowell, 95, is one of the world’s most influential economists and social philosophers, and has written more than 45 books. But “ [A Conflict of Visions](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780465002054): Ideological Origins of Political Struggles,” which he published in 1987, [is his favorite](https://www.deseret.com/2005/12/15/19927783/thomas-sowell-best-books-open-the-eyes-and-mind-of-the-reader/). In it, he traces the underlying logic behind all modern political divides. Why is it that knowing someone’s position on one issue, say gun control, makes it easy to predict their position on a totally unrelated issue, like abortion? Some people would chalk it up to political tribalism. Sowell, who was a Marxist as a young man before becoming one of the most important conservative thinkers in America, argues it’s something deeper: a clash of instinctive “visions” about human nature and the limits of social engineering.***

***“A Conflict of Visions” is the book that Coleman chose to discuss with Shilo Brooks for the latest episode of “Old School.” Their conversation—recorded well before yesterday’s election—illuminates why some of us buy into utopian projects of remaking society, while others trust the quiet power of incentive structures like free markets.***

***We’re excited to share that episode below, along with a new essay from Coleman on Sowell, Mamdani, and the future of the American left. —The Editors***

It would seem a perfect time for Marxists to celebrate. New York City has elected a proud socialist as its mayor.

But if history is any guide, the celebration may be short-lived. Across the world—from the Soviet Union to Venezuela—the antidote to Marxism has always been experiencing Marxism. Indeed, some of the fiercest and most effective critics of Marxism began as Marxists themselves. This was true, for instance, of Robert Nozick, Irving Kristol, Robert Conquest, Paul Johnson, Deirdre McCloskey, Kingsley Amis, and Eugene Genovese and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese.

Of all the intellectuals that started out as collectivists only to become staunch capitalists, perhaps none is more famous than Thomas Sowell. Sowell was drawn to Karl Marx as a young man because, as [he put it](https://reason.com/2021/06/12/the-conversion-of-thomas-sowell/), the German philosopher explained so much of his “grim experience.” Sowell was born during the Great Depression in Jim Crow North Carolina. [He was raised](https://www.hoover.org/research/thomas-sowell-my-life) by his great-aunt in a small house on an unpaved street, where he spent his early years without hot water or electricity. As a teenager he lived for a time in a homeless shelter, sleeping with a knife under his pillow. Marxism seemed to explain why people like him had so little while others had so much.

What pierced Sowell’s bubble? He summed it up in one word: “evidence.” That evidence was not gleaned from his studies—indeed he remained a Marxist even while he was at the University of Chicago, studying economics under free-market enthusiast Milton Friedman. It came from the real world.

In 1960, a 30-year-old Sowell served as an intern at the Department of Labor, assigned to analyze Puerto Rico’s sugar industry, where a federal minimum wage applied. As he looked at the data, Sowell noticed a troubling pattern: Every time the minimum wage was raised, unemployment climbed. Sowell began to wonder whether the law itself was causing the job losses, as [standard economic theory](https://aier.org/article/the-economics-of-the-minimum-wage-myths-facts-and-consequences/) would predict.

What pierced Sowell’s bubble? He summed it up in one word: “evidence.”

His colleagues disagreed. They offered another explanation: A hurricane had devastated the crops. To find out which explanation was correct, Sowell proposed a test: “What we need,” [he told his co-workers](https://www.city-journal.org/article/the-nonconformist) excitedly, “are statistics on the amount of sugarcane standing in the field before the hurricanes came through Puerto Rico.” If there was plenty of sugarcane before the storms, then the hurricane couldn’t be the culprit. The suggestion was met with a “stunned silence” and promptly rejected. After all, one-third of the department’s funding [was tied to](https://financialpost.com/opinion/thomas-sowell-how-he-became-thomas-sowell) enforcement of the minimum wage law. Sowell’s proposed investigation threatened the very policy that many of these government workers depended on. Sowell realized that government workers tend to pursue their individual self-interest, and because their work is not subject to feedback from the market, they tend to provide subpar services.

For Sowell, it was the minimum wage office. For the Marx-curious denizens of New York City, it may well be Zohran Mamdani’s [government-run grocery stores](https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform) —if they even materialize. Perhaps it will be his free buses that don’t run on time or his rent freezes that cause the supply of housing to dry up. Either way, experiencing socialism may be the fastest way to undo its appeal.

For the most part, Mamdani voters do not come from deep poverty like Sowell does. Indeed, in the primary, [Cuomo outperformed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/25/nyregion/nyc-mayor-election-results-map-mamdani-cuomo.html) Mamdani with low-income New Yorkers. They do, however, come from a generation that feels, rightly or wrongly, that the American dream is [harder for them to achieve](https://www.thefp.com/p/yuppies-socialists-zohran-mamdani) than it was for their parents. Many are saddled with college debt and degrees that are worthless to prospective employers. Even if their experience is nowhere near as grim as Sowell’s, they still feel that their economic reality has fallen far short of their expectations.

Meanwhile, billionaires have never been more conspicuous. No one with an internet connection could miss Jeff Bezos’s [reportedly $50 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/27/jeff-bezos-50-million-venice-wedding-what-we-know.html) wedding, for which parts of Venice [were cleared](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/venice-closes-off-city-district-113429736.html) to accommodate the festivities—or the voyages on his [$500 million superyacht](https://people.com/all-about-jeff-bezos-superyacht-koru-11759497), complete with a carved figurehead of his wife, Lauren Sánchez, on the prow. And while many Americans worry about saving for retirement or paying for childcare, the interest Bezos earns on his fortune in a few minutes could change their lives. It is that feeling of envy that opens the psychological door to Marxism—whether you’re a poor kid in North Carolina or a middle-class millennial working in a cubicle in New York City.

Socialism’s appeal lies in youthful idealism, as well as lack of experience in the real world—variables that reverse with time. So while New York has shifted to the left for now, perhaps the city is simply at the beginning of a painful journey along a steep learning curve that millions around the world—including luminaries like Thomas Sowell—have already completed.
