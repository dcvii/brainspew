Total White Population

Total White alone non-Latino population of the county according to the 2010 Census, Summary File 1, Table P5.

Total Black Population

Total Black alone population, (which may include Black Latinos), of the county according to the 2010 Census, Summary File 1, Table P3.

Total Hispanic/Latino population of the county according to the 2010 Census, Summary File 1, Table P4.

Incarcerated Population

Total incarcerated population according to the 2010 Census, Summary File 1, Table P42.

Incarcerated White Population

Total White alone, non-Latino incarcerated population according to the 2010 Census, Summary File 1, Table PCT20I.

Incarcerated Black Population

Total Black alone incarcerated population (which may include Latinos) according to the 2010 Census, Summary File 1, Table PCT20B.

Incarcerated Latino Population

Total Hispanic/Latino incarcerated population according to the 2010 Census, Summary File 1, Table PCT20H.

Non-incarcerated Population

This is the total population minus the incarcerated population.

Non-incarcerated white Population

This is the total white population minus the incarcerated white population.

Non-Incarcerated Black Population

This is the total Black population minus the incarcerated Black population.

Non-Incarcerated Latino Population

This is the total Latino population minus the incarcerated Latino population.

Ratio of Overrepresentation of Whites Incarcerated Compared to Whites Non-Incarcerated

This is the proportion of incarcerated White people in the county divided by the proportion of non-incarcerated White people. For example, if White people made up of 20% of the incarcerated population, and 40% of the non-incarcerated population. The ratio of overrepresentation would be.5.

Ratio of Overrepresentation of Blacks Incarcerated Compared to Blacks Non-Incarcerated

This is the proportion of incarcerated Black people in the county divided by the proportion of non-incarcerated Black people. For example, if Black people made up of 20% of the incarcerated population, and 20% of the non-incarcerated population. The ratio of overrepresentation would be 2.

Ratio of Overrepresentation of Latinos Incarcerated Compared to Latinos Non-Incarcerated

This is the proportion of incarcerated Latino people in the county divided by the proportion of non-incarcerated Latino people. For example, if Latino people made up of 10% of the incarcerated population, and 4% of the non-incarcerated population. The ratio of overrepresentation would be 2.5.
