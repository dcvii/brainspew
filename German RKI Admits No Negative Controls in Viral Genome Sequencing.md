### Scientific standards abandoned in foundational COVID-19 research.

The German RKI has confirmed they conducted no negative controls during genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and measles viruses. Negative controls—where identical methodology is applied to samples **without the target virus** —are essential for validating results. Instead, they relied solely on **unvalidated** PCR testing to confirm presence prior to sequencing.

Here's the English translation of the relevant abstract:

**“Both the cultivation of measles and SARS-CoV-2 viruses as well as the genome sequencing of such viruses is carried out at the RKI naturally in accordance with the standards of good scientific practice. However, these do not provide for negative samples to be included during virus cultivation or genome sequencing. Rather, virus detection already takes place beforehand by means of molecular detection via PCR and/or sequencing. Therefore, only pre-analyzed samples are used for virus cultivation or genome sequencing itself, where it has already been established that they contain the virus. Documentation and results for negative controls with healthy patient samples during the cultivation of measles viruses and SARS-CoV-2 or the genome sequencing of such viruses therefore do not exist.”**

**Key points from this RKI statement:**

- They claim to follow "good scientific practice"
- They admit no negative controls are used in cultivation or sequencing
- They rely on prior PCR/sequencing to "confirm" virus presence
- Only "pre-analyzed" samples (already assumed to contain virus) are used
- No documentation exists of negative controls with healthy samples

**This confirms circular reasoning - they're using PCR to "prove" virus presence, then using that same assumption to justify not including proper controls in sequencing.**

This also **directly** contradicts findings from my CDC FOIA request, which revealed that no sample has ever been sequenced containing only purified viral genetic material. The CDC confirmed the presence of **contaminating** genetic material during SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, leaving the possibility wide open **that** the sequence **could be** a semi-random construct.

**The methodological problem:**  
This creates a circular reasoning issue. To validate that a genomic sequence is accurate, researchers must either:

1. Sequence a purified sample containing only viral genetic material
	\-or-
2. Obtain continuous sequencing reads spanning the entire claimed genome.

To my knowledge, neither approach has been accomplished & documented.

Here's a summary from Claude AI on why negative controls are crucial:
