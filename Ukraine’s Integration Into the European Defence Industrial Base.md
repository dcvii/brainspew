### In this week’s Europe Dispatch, Minna Ålander takes stock of the latest developments in European and Ukrainian defence industry.

Hi Everyone,

I tried my best to highlight some of the work in progress in Europe to improve Ukraine’s own defence production capacity and to integrate Ukraine into the emerging European defence industrial and technological base. So much is happening on a company-to-company level that I couldn’t include an exhaustive overview of all the innovative joint ventures, but I hope this gives you a sense of the momentum. The sum of the small details makes up a big picture: while European leaders are walking a fine line in the transatlantic rift, government agency- and company-level cooperation with Ukraine is progressing steadily. It has turned out to be a win-win business for both sides and lessons from Ukraine have high potential to help Europe navigate the challenges it faces when trying to scale up military capability as quickly as possible.

Yours,  
Minna

Are Things Looking Up In Europe?

Ukraine’s Integration Into the European Defence Industrial Base

*European and Ukrainian companies are working together for mutual benefit, showing that Europe is both willing and able to keep supporting Ukraine*

It has been a good start into the new week in Europe. [In Romania, a pro-European candidate won](https://www.politico.eu/article/romanian-presidential-election-results-nicusor-dan-george-simion/) the second round of the presidential elections with a clear margin of victory over the pro-Trump far right candidate – after the first vote was annulled in an [unprecedented decision by the Romanian Constitutional Court](https://apnews.com/article/romania-election-president-georgescu-court-585e8f8f3ce7013951f5c7cf4054179b) in December due to allegations of Russian meddling. Turnout at 65 percent was the highest since 1996, giving the incoming president Nicușor Dan a solid mandate. Yesterday, [the EU adopted the 17 <sup>th</sup> sanctions package on Russia](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/fi/press/press-releases/2025/05/20/russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-eu-agrees-17th-package-of-sanctions/), with an emphasis on targeting the Russian shadow fleet. As a side note I am happy to report that I won a €5 bet on this – my bet was on Hungary caving, as always. The EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission (in short: equivalent to an EU Foreign Minister) Kaja Kallas also announced that the EU is already working on the next sanctions package and expects the US to do the same.

Europe is once again showing that much of the prevalent doomerism is unwarranted. Neither the predicted far-right takeover nor an end to the sanctions regime, forced by a move to lift sanctions by the US, materialised. Lifting sanctions on Russia would likely shorten the time Russia needs to reconstitute and to increase its direct threat potential to Europe, which makes the idea conceivably bad from a European perspective. But the public opinion also plays a role: given the solid support for Ukraine and [71 percent support for sanctions on Russia](https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/3215) in the standard Eurobarometer in fall 2024 – the latest Europe-wide poll, lifting them would be an unpopular decision for political leaders in many parts of Europe. That is why [European leaders have kept emphasizing the role of sanctions](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/27/world/russia-sanctions-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html) in their efforts to engage Trump.

What often escapes the public’s notice – partially because so much is happening and it’s hard to keep track of all the news items – is that Ukraine’s defence industry is being swiftly integrated into the emerging European Defence Industrial and Technological Base (EDIB). Most importantly, it is not just charity but a win-win situation: Ukraine’s self-sufficiency is improved by increased own production and European defence companies get in on the latest innovations from the Ukrainian battlefield. A year ago, [in May 2024, the EU hosted the first EU-Ukraine Defence Industries Forum](https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/joint-press-release-eu-ukraine-defence-industries-forum-bolsters-cooperation-between-ukrainian-and-2024-05-06_en) in a series of multilateral defence industrial events that the government of Ukraine launched in 2023. In September 2024, the EU also opened a [Defence Innovation Office in Kyiv](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/defence-cooperation-ukraine-strengthened-eu-defence-innovation-office-opens-kyiv-2024-09-27_en).

In a proper Orwellian sense, the EU has mobilised [€11.1 bn from the European Peace Facility for military support for Ukraine](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/european-peace-facility/), and has an additional [€50 bn Ukraine Facility](https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/funding-technical-assistance/ukraine-facility_en) to bolster Ukraine’s resilience, to support its EU integration process, and de-risk investment in Ukraine. The support is both grant- and loan-based, including a [€35 billion loan to be repaid with revenue from the frozen Russian assets](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20241017IPR24736/parliament-approves-up-to-EU35-billion-loan-to-ukraine-backed-by-russian-assets). In recognition of Denmark’s both significant and innovative support for Ukraine, Denmark has been acting as the implementor of the so-called “ [Danish model](https://www.fmn.dk/en/news/2025/denmark-to-allocate-more-than-800-million-eur-to-ukraine-on-behalf-of-the-eu-in-2025/) ” on behalf of the EU and other countries’ bilateral aid for disbursing windfall profits from the frozen Russian assets. And [Finland just sent Ukraine an ammunition package](https://yle.fi/a/74-20162643) financed by the interest of the Russian assets. And pressure is mounting to [not only freeze, but also seize](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2025/03/11/european-countries-face-growing-pressure-to-seize-frozen-russian-assets_6739046_5.html) the assets. The numbers above do not even include bilateral aid from EU member states and other European countries, which is many times the amount the EU has allocated to Ukraine – and counting. A detailed overview can be found [here](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/united-states-america/eu-assistance-ukraine-us-dollars_en?s=253).

When it comes to the challenges Europe faces in the continent’s rearmament, the various cooperation formats with Ukraine can provide a blueprint for finding efficient and pragmatic ways of making the most of limited resources. For example, when Sweden and Denmark jointly procured new CV-90 infantry vehicles for their defence forces, they added [40 for Ukraine](https://www.government.se/press-releases/2024/12/joint-infantry-fighting-vehicle-procurement-worth-sek-25-billion-signed/) into the order. A similar method could be used to improve air and missile defence in the Baltic states that lack the financial capacity to procure expensive platforms, even if they spend 5 percent of GDP or more on defence (5 percent of the Estonian GDP amounts to about €2 billion). The Swedish Defence Materiel Agency has established a presence in Ukraine to support Ukraine’s procurement more directly. Now, the Swedish agency is testing a new method: the so-called “ [military challenges](https://www.fmv.se/aktuellt--press/aktuella-handelser/ny-utmaning-mojliggor-innovativt-stod-till-ukraina/) ” to tech companies to come up with innovative and quickly materializable solutions to Ukraine’s urgent needs.

Major European arms producers, such as Rheinmetall and Thales, as well as a countless number of smaller enterprises and startups have established joint ventures with Ukrainian counterparts – partially also in Ukraine. A somewhat incomplete overview from late 2024 can be found [here](https://www.iris-france.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ARES_2024_12_107_Ukraine_Defence_Industry_PolicyPaper.pdf). Joint procurement and defence industrial cooperation have usually proven difficult endeavours in Europe, so the experience in finding more innovative solutions when time, not money, is the decisive factor, can be used to improve processes beyond cooperation with Ukraine. Good cases in point is the [Baltic startup](https://frankenburg.tech/) that states as its aim “to develop missile systems that are ten times more affordable, a hundred times faster to produce, and in quantities far exceeding current industry capabilities” and a Finnish company is working on [drone production](https://summadefence.fi/en/our-companies/summa-drones/) and [AI-based solutions](https://defence-industry.eu/summa-defence-and-griselda-partner-to-develop-ai-driven-defence-technologies-in-ukraine/) together with Ukrainian counterparts.

By working together with Ukraine, European companies are not only increasing Ukraine’s own production capacity but also learning directly from Ukraine’s battlefield experience – something that will help Europe not only to replace US capabilities, but to think ahead.
