Building a car and creating a brand that actually stands a chance in the cutthroat automotive world is no small feat. Just ask Elon Musk or [RJ Scaringe from Rivian](https://www.carscoops.com/2025/04/rivian-boss-says-ev-shoppers-need-more-sub-50k-options/), people who, despite their endless resources and connections, are often still figuring it out.

Yet, a pair of engineers in California are aiming to convince driving enthusiasts to shell out almost half a million dollars for their creation. So, who are these engineers, and what exactly have they been up to?

**Meet Shoreline Bespoke**

Behind Shoreline Bespoke are Spencer Beckman and Kyle Krueger. The firm was founded in 2021 and is working on a lightweight, two-seat sports car with retro-inspired styling. The duo presented a rolling chassis of their car last year, much like Lamborghini did with the Miura back in 1965, and have since been working to finish their work.

It’s no secret that modern cars have become big, heavy, and overcomplicated. Shoreline Bespoke wants the LM Coupe to be different. The differences begin with the design, which draws inspiration from several classic racing cars, particularly [the Porsche 906 from the 1960s](https://www.carscoops.com/2024/02/this-is-the-2-2-million-porsche-racing-car-youve-never-heard-of/). It’s a welcome reprieve from the designs of many modern sports cars, combining timeless elegance with modern technologies.

At the core of the LM Coupe is a hand-built, tubular steel spaceframe. The car features adjustable double-wishbone suspension at all four corners, AP Racing brakes, and a custom-built steering system.

All of these elements combine to create a car that could weigh as little as 1,400 pounds (635 kg), because when it comes to lightweight sports cars, less really is more. Not that you need a comparison, but that’s nearly half the weight of an ND Miata, which starts at 2,366 pounds (1073.2 kg)!

Given that Shoreline wants to make the LM Coupe as light as possible, it comes as no surprise that it opted for a small, yet exhilarating, engine. Fitted behind the seats will be a 1.65-liter naturally-aspirated straight-six engine, believed to be derived from the engine uses in the K1600 motorcycle, but rebuilt and upgraded by Ed Pink to deliver as much as 250 hp. Not only will this compact engine pack a punch, but it will also rev to 10,000 rpm.

Shoreline has opted against using a traditional H-pattern manual transmission, opting instead for a sequential gearbox with a clutch pedal.

The cabin also takes inspiration from classic racing prototypes. It’ll feature a pair of carbon fiber bucket seats that are fixed in position while making use of an adjustable pedal box and steering wheel. There’s no infotainment screen, and instead, simply a magnetic phone mount.

Shoreline Bespoke will showcase the LM Coupe at August’s . It hopes to begin customer deliveries in late 2026.
