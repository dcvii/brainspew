MINNEAPOLIS—Minnesota law-enforcement officials said Thursday that the FBI blocked them from participating in an investigation into [the fatal shooting of a woman](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/minneapolis-minnesota-shooting-ice-8bccecc1?mod=article_inline) by an ICE agent, intensifying the dispute between the state and the federal government over the death.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz denounced the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s decision to exclude the state from the investigation, saying any probe that doesn’t include state law enforcement can’t be trusted. “It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said Thursday.

Vice President JD Vance defended the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent and criticized the woman who was killed, Renee Nicole Good, calling her a “victim of left-wing ideology.”

“I can believe that her death is a tragedy while also recognizing that it’s a tragedy of her own making,” Vance said during a lengthy appearance in the White House briefing room on Thursday.

Democratic leaders denounced the Trump administration and its policies and called for a full investigation into the shooting. “The killing of Renee Nicole Good was an abomination,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) said Thursday.

“Blood is clearly on the hands of those individuals within the administration who’ve been pushing an extreme policy,” he said.

The FBI had originally agreed to a joint investigation on Wednesday, said Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. On Thursday, the FBI said it would solely handle the investigation and would no longer provide state law enforcement with access to case materials or evidence.

“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Minnesota law enforcement doesn’t have any jurisdiction in the investigation. The FBI’s Minneapolis office didn’t respond to a request for comment.

In a separate incident on Thursday, a Border Patrol agent [shot two people](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/two-people-shot-by-federal-agents-in-portland-ore-8e07c9ed?mod=article_inline) in Portland, Ore. Homeland Security said the agent fired a defensive shot when the driver attempted to run over agents.

In Minneapolis, the death of Good, who was [37 and a mother of three](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/what-we-know-so-far-about-renee-nicole-good-bb3d847c?mod=article_inline), has sparked protests demanding immigration-enforcement agents leave the city. Meanwhile, local officials have challenged the Trump administration’s account of the incident.

Videos of the shooting, which took place on a residential street south of downtown Minneapolis, were shared widely on social media.

The videos show Good’s car stopped in the middle of a one-way road. Several agents can be seen approaching the car, ordering her to get out before she tries to back it up and drive off. As the car advances, an agent fires shots into the car. Good’s vehicle then travels a few more feet before crashing into a parked car.

Some footage showed an officer firing his gun both while in front of the vehicle and from the side as Good attempted to pull away. On Wednesday, President Trump posted a video to social media from a different angle that appeared to show the officer more squarely in front of the vehicle.

Homeland Security said an agent fired in self-defense after Good attempted to run over officers, but state and city officials have disputed that version of events after seeing videos on social media that seemed to support witness accounts that Good was attempting to flee the scene rather than harm anyone.

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he watched the shooting from a second-floor window in his home. He said he saw two men he believed to be agents surround a maroon Honda Pilot while another pulled on the driver’s side handle a couple of times. The Pilot reversed and then pulled away while one of the men opened fire by the driver’s side door, Perzana said.

“It looked solidly like she was attempting to escape,” said Perzana, a data engineer in Minneapolis.

He said he saw the car drive around 30 feet before drifting into another vehicle and a telephone pole. He said agents ran to the car, but none tried to help the driver.

A man at the scene of the shooting who identified himself as a physician asked federal agents whether he could conduct a pulse check for Good, who can be seen slumped over in her vehicle, according to footage verified by Storyful, which is owned by News Corp, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal.

“We have medics on scene, we have our own medics,” an agent responded.

Homeland Security said the same ICE officer who shot Good was previously dragged by a car in June while trying to arrest a Guatemalan citizen convicted of felony sex offenses, leaving him with deep cuts that required 33 stitches. The name of the ICE deportation officer associated with that dragging is more-than-10-year veteran Jonathan Ross, according to court documents.

Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin wouldn’t confirm the name of Ross but maintained the agent “acted according to his training” on Wednesday.

Dozens of protesters gathered outside the federal Whipple Building on Thursday after overnight vigils where hundreds gathered to mourn Good.

More than 100 heavily armed federal officers were on-site at the federal building’s parking lot. Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who has led militarized immigration operations in [Los Angeles and Chicago](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/greg-bovino-border-patrol-chicago-b5583824?mod=article_inline), walked along the line of officers, prompting taunts from the protesters.

Lauren Johnson, a 40-year-old designer from a Twin Cities suburb, held up a sign simply saying “Renee.” in black marker.

“Remember her name,” she yelled at Bovino as he walked away.

Walz on Thursday authorized the Minnesota National Guard to be ready to support local law enforcement if necessary. He said the Guard would intervene “in the event they are needed to help keep the peace, ensure public safety and allow for peaceful demonstrations.”

Minneapolis Public Schools canceled classes for Thursday and Friday because of safety concerns related to the shooting. Walz said federal immigration officials entered a Minnesota school Wednesday and caused disruptions there.

Speaking at a press conference in New York about an unrelated ICE operation, Noem reiterated her characterization of the woman shot by the ICE officer as an “act of domestic terrorism.”

Some officials in ICE’s headquarters were alarmed that the leadership in the Trump administration quickly labeled the incident an act of “domestic terrorism,” rather than waiting to conduct an investigation into the incident, according to people familiar with the matter.

Officials internally passed around an interview with Tom Homan on CBS News, in which the border czar said he would reserve judgment while an investigation is under way, the people said.

Vance questioned the legality of whether Minnesota officials could press charges against the ICE officer. “The unprecedented thing is the idea that a local official can actually prosecute a federal official with absolute immunity,” Vance said. “I’ve never seen anything like that. It would get tossed out by a judge.”

Officers enjoy significant legal protections for actions they take during the course of their jobs, but those protections can be overcome if prosecutors establish that an officer knowingly engaged in egregious conduct that clearly falls outside of the law.

Law-enforcement officers are prosecuted occasionally for excessive use of force, but it is typically local cops being charged by local prosecutors. Legal observers say it would be rare, though not unprecedented, for local and state leaders to look to prosecute a federal officer over the objections of the federal government.
