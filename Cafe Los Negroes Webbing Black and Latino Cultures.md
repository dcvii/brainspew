> > 
> > ![](https://static01.nyt.com/library/cyber/digimet/0527digimet-flag.gif) Visitors who walk into a bodega in Jackson Heights, Queens, can find cans of Mexican anchiote paste sitting on shelves next to jars of pre-blended Mughal Garam Masala.
> > 
> > But Web surfers turning to the Net for a jolt of the New York experience must think that life here is like a giant episode of Friends -- single, white twentysomethings gossiping, chasing the latest fashions and grousing about their dead-end jobs.
> > 
> > Enter McLean Greaves, mastermind behind [Cafe Los Negroes](https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/digimet/0527digimet.html#1) -- the first Web site to try to capture the spirit and sensibility of black and Latino bohemia in New York. Launched at the beginning of the year, Cafe Los Negroes has so far focused on capturing the work of contemporary black and Latino artists with visual exhibits in the Bed- Stuy Gallery section; QuickTime video of choreographers, dancers and poets performing; a fashion section on "Hood Couture" and a collection of columns, reviews, links, and diaries.
> > 
> > ![](https://static01.nyt.com/library/cyber/digimet/0527digimet-negroes.gif) But Greaves plans to go beyond the current content, turning Cafe Los Negroes into a proving ground for young artists and writers who can't find an outlet in traditional big-time media. Already young artists have drawn attention beyond the site. Marlie Yearby, a choreographer who was featured in the first edition of Cafe Los Negroes, is now working on Rent, this season's most talked about Broadway musical. And the site will soon launch its Cybirdland series of archived jazz performances by young artists taped live at Birdland on West 105 Street.

> > "I was blown away by the talent" in the black avant-garde in neighborhoods like Fort Greene and Bedford- Stuyvesant," said Greaves, a Canadian who moved here 18 months ago. "There are a lot of good writers, choreographers, musicians. At least we can give them a presence on line. A lot of the people who grew up in New York don't realize what they have."
> > 
> > Until now, little of the content generated by New York's new-media has had a racial or ethnic focus, and few of Silicon Alley's creators have been people of color. While Web zines have explored every aspect of the modeling trade and the alternative rock scene, almost none have even tried to explore Asian-American life on Main Street in Flushing, or Dominican life in Inwood. New York's [Latin Music On-Line](https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/digimet/0527digimet.html#1) does a terrific job covering the salsa, merenge and Latino rock scene locally, but keeps its focus on music.
> > 
> > Nationally, there have been several attempts to create racial-theme Web sites -- like [Net Noir](https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/digimet/0527digimet.html#1) or [Melanet](https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/digimet/0527digimet.html#1) -- but none has yet sprung up in New York. (Soon New York will have "The Black World Today," an ambitious news site covering the world from the perspective of black journalists).
> > 
> > But for local content, Cafe Los Negroes remains the only game in town.
> > 
> > Much of Greaves' inspiration comes from the filmmaker Spike Lee, who still casts a long shadow over Fort Greene's artistic community. Like Lee, Greaves hopes to "take New York's flavor and export it to the rest of the planet." Now Greaves will have Lee's help. The filmmaker's 40 Acres and a Mule production company just signed a deal with the Cafe's parent corporation, Virtual Melanin Inc., making VMI Lee's new-media outlet.
> > 
> > So far so good, said the 29-year-old Greaves, who recently left a job at Paper, the downtown fashion magazine, to concentrate on the Web business and his side career as a TV journalist for the Canadian Broadcasting Company. But while Cafe Los Negroes has done a fair job capturing the best of avant-Brooklyn, Greaves doesn't want to ignore the ugly parts of life in and around VMI's Bed-Stuy headquarters.
> > 
> > "I've seen five beat-downs and three shootings since I've been in New York," Greaves said. "I want to put that on line, to let people know that in spite of Giuliani's insistence that New York is a great city -- and it is a great city -- there's a tradeoff for that."
> > 
> > | ![](https://static01.nyt.com/library/cyber/digimet/0527digimet-diary.gif)   **  Negrofile by McLean Greaves is "an unpredictable diary of a   hexadecimal homie entrenched in New York's rapidly growing   cybernegroidal movement -- gossip and all."    ---    ** |

> > 
> > Cafe Los Negroes will soon include a live "Hood Cam" video shot of life along Franklin Avenue in Bedford- Stuyvesant. Greaves hopes the camera will capture Franklin Avenue's crack and prostitution trades. "I want to give a true depiction of what it's like," he said, "to capture the beauty and the ugliness."
> > 
> > The Net can become the ultimate journalistic tool, Greaves said, giving anyone the chance to be a journalist, and giving blacks, Latinos, Asian-Americans and others a chance to define themselves in the new media instead of having their images drawn by white America, as is often the case in traditional media.
> > 
> > For Greaves, the Web site is the first step in a self- described mission is to make laptops as popular in the inner city as beepers are today. That's why he's focusing on developing young talent. That's also why he hopes to take his message into schools.
> > 
> > Virtual Melanin also plans an internship program designed to draw neighborhood kids into new media. "In the neighborhood those kids have a lot of time on their hands," Greaves said. "We'll train them from scratch.
> > 
> > "I'm really hoping that the next Bill Gates will be a kid out of the projects."
