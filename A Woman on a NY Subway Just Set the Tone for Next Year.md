### This is what's coming in 2026

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-z26!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbebe9496-280c-44d9-a49a-15ee49263f13_1057x352.png)

A few weeks ago, a man got on the New York subway wearing his expensive Meta AI glasses. They cost $300, but give users super powers—for example [identifying total strangers](https://www.cdpinstitute.org/news/meta-smart-glasses-can-id-strangers-in-seconds/), and taking [quasi-surveillance videos](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-turning-its-ray-bans-into-a-surveillance-machine-for-ai-2000596395).

It’s a step below Superman. But it’s the best that Mark Zuckerberg can offer right now.

A woman on the subway wasn’t impressed. She stepped up to this tech-loving bro, and grabbed his glasses. Then she broke them in two with her bare hands.

He smugly told her that she would soon “be famous on the Internet.” But she didn’t flinch and just stared him down.

In the aftermath, he posted a protest [video on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@eth8n_____/video/7559441318066310413?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121749182%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121497414%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121811500%2C121960941%2C121860360%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121885509%3Bnull%3Bembed_name&refer=embed&referer_url=www.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2Fimagine-being-based-guy-says-143000399.html&referer_video_id=7559441318066310413) —asking for help in finding this anti-tech vigilante. And he called her a “Karen”—which seems to be the new way of saying *bitch*.

But the response was the opposite of what he expected.

Two million people watched the video, and many responded with enthusiastic support for the woman.

- “She’s a queen.”
- “I’m on her side.”
- “She looks like the coolest person I’ve ever seen. Street justice.”
- “I hope she called him a dork for wearing them before she broke them.”
- “She’s doing God’s work.”

A follow-up news account [called her a hero](https://futurism.com/future-society/woman-hero-smashing-meta-smart-glasses-subway). She didn’t put up with tech surveillance—and not a single person on the subway tried to stop her.

It’s a small incident, but reveals the public’s growing hostility to high tech. Not long ago, new gadgets from Silicon Valley were cool and trendy. Not anymore—if you use this stuff, you’re now just a dork.

A few days after the subway incident, McDonald’s also found itself in the dork category. The fast food chain released an AI-generated TV commercial—and expected people to praise its savvy use of new tech.

But, once again, the opposite happened. McDonald’s faced a [“deluge of mockery.”](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/mcdonalds-ai-generated-commercial) And the company backed down—halting the ad campaign and working to [remove all traces of the commercial from the web](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/mcdonalds-ai-commercial).

Coca-Cola made the same mistake. It released an AI-generated commercial and even bragged that it was [cheaper and faster](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coca-cola-injects-holidays-are-coming-ads-with-an-upgraded-dose-of-ai-bc8921e2?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfWir3awEgR-ctnVfYD0XYFCNY6rMaaxsrkOWkI3mT4mAdmhr-KB6gW&gaa_ts=693dc1b8&gaa_sig=5BBD_zW5l53dGTwnnaUwmVJq7ivbcuUruyaRb_1ds1eVgNNaLW_fSY-KLL_dg6cCXNTdjwGfgsS-qToulPionw%3D%3D) doing it this way. But the ad generated a [“frenzy of bad publicity.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/11/04/coca-cola-sparks-backlash-with-ai-generated-christmas-ad-again/)

Some pointed out [glitches and inconsistencies](https://www.businessinsider.com/coca-cola-ai-holiday-ad-glitches-highlight-ai-shortcomings-2025-11). Others just ridiculed it as slop or garbage. A few people even [called for a boycott](https://x.com/kortizart/status/1985600153093591046), or announced that they were [switching to Pepsi](https://x.com/homosexualmouse/status/1991345832181002307)

The people running these companies are shocked by this hostility. They keep hearing about the marvels of AI from consultants and tech sales reps—so they have no idea how much AI is hated by their customers.

They will soon find out.

Microsoft is now facing a similar backlash. After launching Windows 11 with its integration of AI, a huge number of users complained. ([I was one of them](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-force-feeding-of-ai-on-an-unwilling).) Now we’ve learned (via a recent earnings call from Dell) that [owners of almost one billion computers have simply refused to upgrade](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/nearly-1-billion-pcs-remain-on-windows-10-has-windows-11-adoption-hit-a-wall).

Why don’t they want the new improved operating system? [According to](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/windows-users-refusing-upgrade-windows-11-ai) *[Futurism](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/windows-users-refusing-upgrade-windows-11-ai)*, it’s the bundling of AI:

> Given the widespread backlash over Microsoft’s doubling down on AI features, there’s a good chance a vast number of Windows users are also balking at the idea of the company shoving those features down their throats.

Browser company Mozilla got an even more intense wake-up call a few days ago. It bragged that it would [turn its Firefox product into a “modern AI browser.”](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/outcry-firefox-promises-kill-switch-ai-features) But so many people complained that the company went into damage control mode—announcing that they would let people turn off AI completely.

Have you noticed the pattern? People are now refusing to play along.

“Folks in tech do not appreciate that the entire country is polarized against tech,” commented venture capitalist Sebastian Caliri in a [recent social media post](https://x.com/SebastianCaliri/status/2003272659552149704). “The only thing AI seems to offer most Americans is job loss and more billions for billionaires. We need a better story.”

“Silicon Valley needs to read the room,” [writes Sharon Goldman in](https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/silicon-valleys-tone-deaf-take-on-the-ai-backlash-will-matter-in-2026/) *[Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/silicon-valleys-tone-deaf-take-on-the-ai-backlash-will-matter-in-2026/)*. Right now tech leaders only express smug disdain—the public is too stupid, they claim, to appreciate the miracle of chatbot domination. This will result, Goldman believes in “increasing societal and political backlash.”

That backlash is already playing out in cities across the country.

A few days ago, the citizens in Chandler, Arizona successfully [blocked the construction of an AI data center](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/12/arizona-city-rejects-data-center-after-ai-lobbying-push-00688543) —despite aggressive lobbying from tech interests. AI companies are now running scared. They have lost the battle at the grassroots level so their only hope is intervention from the federal government.

“$64 billion of data center projects have been blocked or delayed amid local opposition,” [according to Data Center Watch](https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report). This is now turning into a hot political issue, and has influenced recent elections in [Virginia](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/13/2025/as-electricity-bills-rise-candidates-in-both-parties-blame-data-centers), [Georgia](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/us/politics/data-centers-electric-bills-georgia.html), and other states. In every instance, the public has rallied around candidates opposed to the AI facilities.

“We would knock 80 to 100 doors \[per day\] and in that process have 15 conversations,” [explained one candidate](https://www.vox.com/technology/471138/ai-data-centers-electricity-prices-populist-backlash-explained). “More than 10 of them would be about data centers in this context—which is remarkable.”

There are legitimate fears that this backlash might escalate into violence. When [Sam Kirchner a prominent AI critic recently disappeared from public view](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/sam-kirchner-missing-stop-ai/685144/), the police department issued a warning. OpenAI even implemented a lockdown at its headquarters.

More reasonable people prevailed at StopAI, the organization Kirchner helped launch. That group promotes non-violent protest (and I do too). But we have seen from similar situations how easily public backlash escalates out of control and how much damage rogue individuals can do.

This is the tense situation we have inherited, and it’s likely to get even more heated in the coming weeks. We are entering an election year where affordability will be a major issue—and the impact of data centers on energy costs will get raised again and again.

Legacy media has failed so far to grasp the significance of this shift in public opinion. It doesn’t fit neatly into conventional political or identity group alliances—which makes it harder for journalists to assess. But this is simply an indicator of how widespread the discontent and unrest are.

But the numbers are clear. Gallup tells us that 80% of the public wants to slow down AI development. Only 9% favor fast acceleration. That’s more than 10-to-1 opposition. And the backlash is still growing—so just imagine what it will look in another 12 months.

So be on the lookout. Tech backlash might just be the biggest issue of 2026.

Silicon Valley has never faced antagonism of this sort in its entire history. I doubt they’re prepared for it.

In the past, they have simply ignored critics—and have focused on lobbying politicians. That’s unlikely to work in this supercharged environment. Sooner or later, the tech power brokers will need to engage with their critics.

They ought to start to preparing for that now—because the longer they delay, the uglier this situation will get.
