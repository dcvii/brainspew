### At the edge of fear, courage becomes the spark that lights the path forward.

In a time when democracy is under siege, at home and abroad, it’s easy to fixate on what we’re fighting against: authoritarianism, disinformation, corruption, apathy. But at the [Renew Democracy Initiative](https://rdi.org/) ’s 2025 Gala last night, something far more radical happened.

We remembered what we are fighting for.

The night’s theme—Back to the Future—wasn’t about nostalgia. It was about vision, a reminder that preserving and rebuilding democracy requires more than outrage. It demands courage, imagination, and faith in what America can still become when it lives up to its promise.

I was honored to be in a room filled with astronauts, journalists, dissidents, diplomats, veterans, and everyday citizens who’ve made extraordinary sacrifices for freedom. As someone who has deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and worked extensively in the Middle East and Africa, I’ve seen what happens when democratic institutions fall. And I remain very concerned about watching what’s unfolding here in our country. At the RDI Gala, I saw a powerful show of resilience, resolve and hope.

This Wasn’t Just a Look Back. It Was a Call Forward.

RDI spotlighted American excellence—not as a museum piece, but as a blueprint for the future and proof of what is possible. That vision is deeply personal for RDI CEO [Uriel Epshtein](https://rdi.org/team/uriel-epshtein/), whose parents were raised in the former Soviet Union. His father, an anti-communist dissident, was born under Joseph Stalin in 1936. His mother came of age in Kiev, amid overwhelming anti-Semitism. That legacy of resistance to authoritarianism is embedded in RDI’s mission—and it showed.

The evening kicked off with trailblazing astronauts [Terry Virts](https://www.terryvirts.com/), [Scott Kelly](https://www.scottkelly.com/), and [Aisha Bowe](https://www.aishabowe.com/) reminding us of Earth’s fragility and our shared fate. “We need to be crew mates, not just passengers,” they urged. Their message was simple: perspective inspires responsibility.

(Yes, that’s U.S. Senator Mark Kelly’s twin brother—also an astronaut. It was a pleasure to meet Scott and his incredible wife and spend time talking with them throughout the evening.)

[Masih Alinejad](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/nyregion/masih-alinejad-iran-guilty-verdict.html), the Iranian-American journalist who was the target of an Iran-sponsored assassination attempt in Brooklyn, delivered one of the evening’s most powerful calls to action. “Do not ever let the dictators put the fear inside your heart,” she said. Her bravery is a testament to the global and deeply personal stakes of this fight—a stark reminder that authoritarian regimes will go to great lengths to silence dissent—even on American soil.

As someone who is routinely targeted here in the United States and has learned to live with the constant awareness of threats, I draw strength from watching Masih press forward with such fierce determination. On the morning of the event, as I arrived at the train station in New York City, a man walked directly toward me, filming me without a word—then ran off. His demeanor was not friendly…so once again, I placed the dreaded call to my family, putting them on alert, not knowing what that incident meant for the days to come. Moments like that are unsettling, but they’re also clarifying. *(My advice: always trust your instincts.)* In this fight, courage doesn’t mean ignoring fear—it means moving forward in spite of it.

For me, one of the most emotional moments was hearing from Venezuelan President-Elect [Edmundo González](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/05/g-s1-41109/venezuela-opposition-leader-edmundo-gonzalez-embarks-on-international-tour) and opposition leader [María Corina Machado](https://worldfellows.yale.edu/person/maria-corina-machado/), who addressed the audience from undisclosed locations, both in exile. María Corina’s daughter, [Ana Corina Sosa](https://www.instagram.com/anacorinasosa?igsh=OGJ3MDY1aXY4dDVm), accepted her award in her place—her mother, still in Venezuela, remains in hiding. Their message: when you are fighting for the soul of a nation, resistance is a moral obligation. Their courage reminds us that democracy is not just about systems. It’s about people.

[Garry Kasparov](https://rdi.org/team/garry-kasparov/), RDI Chairman and former world chess champion, laid it out plainly: authoritarianism is not a distant threat. It’s already here. “The last thing you want to hear from a Russian dissident is ‘I told you so.’ Well—I told you so,” he said. He warned of the “Putinization” of America and called out our government’s growing hostility toward our democratic allies. But he also gave us a roadmap forward: show me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you who you are. His message hit hard—and hit home as he pointed out the United States' current decision to align itself with Russia and against our European allies.

The night ended with [Admiral William H. McRaven](https://www.wsb.com/speakers/adm-william-h-mcraven-usn-ret/), the now retired four-star Navy SEAL who led the mission that took down Osama bin Laden. I’ve been privileged to work with him over the course of my career. *(If you’ve never read his book or heard his [Make Your Bed](https://youtu.be/yaQZFhrW0fU?si=00IQlctCGr72HysJ) speech, I highly encourage you to do so. The advice and lessons he passes on from all of his years as a Navy Seal are timeless. No matter how late I’m running in the morning, I still make my bed. Thanks Admiral!)* When he took the stage, he said, “There’s absolutely nothing I can say tonight that should inspire you more than the stories you just heard from Venezuela.” But his own words—and his choice to speak out at this moment in our country’s history—were inspiring all the same. He reminded us that we can’t sit on the sidelines and let democracy slip away. Here is a clip of his speech from the evening that I felt compelled to share with you.

**Why This Night Mattered—And Why I’m Telling You About It**

When I left the Trump administration, I didn’t do it for attention. I did it because I believed that silence in the face of extremism is complicity. I’ve stood alongside others who made hard choices to speak up—and this night was a reminder: we are not alone. You are not alone.

The Gala reminded me of the America we can still be—a nation of explorers, innovators, and defenders of freedom—a place where truth matters, courage counts, and diverse voices come together for a common good. That's what this night stood for. **Their bravery reminded us that the fight for democracy isn't just about institutions; it's about people willing to defy the odds for freedom.**

We can reflect on the past—I'll certainly be here to remind you of what I saw firsthand and expose the playbook. But if we want to win this fight for democracy, we can't just react to threats. We must lead—with strategy, purpose, and vision. One rooted not in fear, but in the belief that this country is still worth fighting for, not just fighting over.

We know what we’re up against. But we also know what we can become—if we remember who we are, and choose to act. As Kasparov launches [The Next Move](https://open.substack.com/pub/thenextmove/p/garry-kasparov-launching-the-next-move?r=2gt5ox&utm_medium=ios), I’ll be in the trenches alongside him. Alongside these heroes. Alongside you.

Until next time,

Olivia
