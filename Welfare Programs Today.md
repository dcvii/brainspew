What are the names of the current welfare program benefits in the US. I assume that AFDC and WIC are no longer current programs.

The United States offers a wide array of federal welfare programs designed to assist low-income individuals and families with basic needs such as cash support, food, health care, housing, and more. These are administered through various agencies like the USDA, HHS, HUD, and others. Note that the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program was replaced by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in 1996 and is no longer active. However, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) remains an active program as of 2025, providing nutrition assistance to eligible pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children.While there are over 80 federal welfare programs in total, below is a categorized overview of the major ones based on common classifications. This is not exhaustive, as programs can vary by state and may include additional state-funded initiatives.

These programs are subject to eligibility requirements, such as income limits (often based on federal poverty guidelines), citizenship status, and work mandates in some cases. Funding and rules can change annually through congressional budgets, but as of 2025, they remain operational despite ongoing debates about reforms and potential cuts. For personalized eligibility, individuals can check resources like Benefits.gov or contact local agencies.
