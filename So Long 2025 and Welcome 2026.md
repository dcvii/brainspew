As we wrap up 2025 and head into 2026, it’s worth taking a quick look back and taking a sneak peek ahead.

We were proud to show our leadership in the Oracle community by once again being the top-level Titanium sponsor of the ODTUG Kscope25 conference in Grapevine, Texas. Kscope is the top technical event for people working with Oracle EPM, Oracle APEX, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle Database, and other related technologies. It was a lot of fun seeing customers, partners, and friends *in person*.

This past year was also a great one for Dodeca. We added some initial AI capabilities, delivered significant enhancements for EPM Cloud, and introduced direct support for several new data sources such as Oracle Cloud EDM and Parquet. We also strengthened security by enhancing support for both SAML and OAuth authentication.

We had some fantastic customer presentations as well including a presentation where one customer shared how Dodeca helped their organization save more than 1,600 man-days per quarter. That is just one of many similar stories we hear from customers.

To add to our acclaimed technical support, we introduced free, online, hands-on training for Dodeca. In this 3-hour, instructor-guided class, you can try Dodeca for yourself and see what all the hype is about. As a self-funded, founder-led company, our measure of success isn’t profitability. Instead, it is the success of our customers who continue using our products in mission-critical applications year after year.

We did have some sad news this year.In late October we lost our Chief Operating Officer, Michael McCarty, after a short illness. Michael was a friend for 30 years and helped lead our company for the past 25 years. His experience and humor are deeply missed, and we’re grateful for everything he contributed to our team and our work.

Looking ahead to 2026, we’re excited to keep pushing forward. We’ll continue adding capabilities to help customers eliminate spreadsheet chaos and use standardization, automation, and enterprise integration to bring confidence to the accuracy of corporate spreadsheets. And if you’re not yet a Dodeca customer, hopefully this will be the year you discover what Dodeca can do for you.

Here’s to a great 2026.
