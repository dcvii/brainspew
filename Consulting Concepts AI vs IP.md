### Off the cuff.

This week I put out a full 30 year resume. I also put together a review of my volunteering. So I’m thinking at a little bit higher level this holiday season.

Here’s a piece - spontaneously from this morning:

\[00:00:01\]  
**Summary of Consulting Philosophy and AI Integration**

- The speaker introduces a conceptual framework distinguishing **bad consulting** from **good consulting**, specifically in the context of a new AI-driven consulting business model.
- **Vibe coding** is explained as a tool primarily for **error correction** and **syntactical parsing** of code, akin to fixing run-on sentences. It is not creative or generative in the literary sense (e.g., cannot write plays or novels).
- Vibe coding is mainly used for:  
	- Combining small chunks of code or content into larger structures under guided supervision (applying **Gaul’s law**).
	- Translating between languages, analogized to autotune changing a song’s key.
- The speaker emphasizes limiting dependence on vibe coding to **small, modular tasks generated from clear requirements** rather than creative or complex outputs.

\[00:01:37\]  
**Outline of a New Consulting Company Model Based on Self-Service BI and AI**

- The consulting firm model is structured around building a **self-service Business Intelligence (BI) system** that can feed into an **AI “catchment basin”** —a system designed to generate **higher-dimensional insights** beyond current methods.
- This higher dimensionality is expected to have **commercial applications primarily in online retail**, while in other sectors, dimensionality will be reduced or slimmed down via techniques like **principal component analysis (PCA)**.
- The approach involves:  
	- Reversing PCA logic to handle a **longer tail of customers and requirements**.
	- Applying a **“sniff test”** to detect and filter out superfluous or irrelevant requirements.
- The consulting focus is on **long-term industry-specific insights**, using aviation as an example where **economic benchmarks, regulations, and operational details** define performance metrics.

\[00:02:39\]  
**Development of an Ultimate Ontology for Industry Consulting**

- The speaker aims to develop an **ultimate ontology** that integrates:  
	- Regulatory compliance,
	- Economic models, and
	- Operational specifics of any business sector.
- This ontology would serve as the **comprehensive knowledge base** for consulting in that industry, enabling precise performance calculations and benchmarking.
- The ontology acts as a normalized framework that can be **customized and adapted** based on client-specific needs and conditions.

\[00:04:16\]  
**Service Model, Revenue Normalization, and Intellectual Property Considerations**

- The consulting service model would:  
	- Include the ontology as a core deliverable.
	- Account for **uneconomic or unrequested extensions** of requirements that clients may not want to pay for, addressing scope creep and budget constraints.
- The consultant intends to **normalize revenue rates** by juggling three variables:  
	1. Client budget,
	2. Project schedule, and
	3. Delivery speed.
- The model emphasizes **transparency in trade-offs** and clearly tracking what innovative or “blue sky” ideas are overlooked due to budget or time constraints.

\[00:05:02\]  
**Human Resource Strategy: Transitioning Developers to Client Staff**

- The speaker stresses the importance of not retaining key developers or engineers as perpetual consultants. Instead:  
	- The client should **hire these personnel directly**, providing continuity and deep understanding of the client’s systems.
	- This aligns with intellectual property strategy: the consulting firm retains the **ultimate ontology and system framework**, but the human expertise monitoring and operating these systems should ideally be owned by the client.
- This strategy prevents conflicts such as a consultant inadvertently aiding competitors by moving developers between clients.
- Key point: The **consulting firm’s value lies in the knowledge base and system design**, not in holding onto personnel permanently.

\[00:05:48\]  
**Maintaining Awareness of Technological, Economic, and Regulatory Changes**

- The consulting firm must stay **on the cutting edge of shifts** in technology, economics, and regulation that affect industry operations.
- The ontology and consulting model should continuously evolve to reflect these changes, allowing the firm to advise clients on **next steps and emerging opportunities**.
- This dynamic knowledge management ensures the firm’s advice remains relevant and anticipates future trends.

\[00:07:16\]  
**Practical Example: Aviation Industry Case Study**

- The speaker contrasts two airlines’ approaches to technology adoption:  
	- **Delta Airlines** uses a legacy **green bar system** for passenger manifests, prioritizing cost savings.
	- **American Airlines** uses **iPads**, which are more efficient, faster, and more accurate, reflecting a willingness to invest in technology.
- The consulting firm works with both, tailoring solutions to the clients’ budget and strategic choices.
- This example illustrates how the ontology and service model incorporate **operational feasibility and regulatory compliance**, adapting to the realities of each business model.

\[00:07:55\]  
**Concluding Remarks on Consulting Model and Ontology Framework**

- The consulting approach revolves around:  
	- Defining what is **operationally feasible** within a client’s business model,
	- Understanding what is **allowed by regulations**, and
	- Capturing that in a **comprehensive ontology** that underpins consulting services.
- The model promotes transparency, customization, and a long-term partnership perspective rather than ad hoc or proprietary formula-driven consulting.

### Key Insights

- **Vibe coding is a syntactic, error-correcting tool, not a creative AI solution.**
- **Building a self-service BI system feeding an AI catchment basin enables higher-dimensional insights tailored to industries.**
- **An ultimate ontology integrating regulation, economics, and operations is central to effective consulting.**
- **Revenue and project management must balance budget, schedule, and delivery speed while tracking “blue sky” innovations.**
- **Key technical personnel should transition from consultants to client employees to preserve intellectual property and continuity.**
- **Continuous monitoring of technological and regulatory evolution is critical to maintaining consulting relevance.**
- **Pragmatic adaptation to client-specific business models and regulatory contexts is essential, exemplified by the aviation industry case.**
