Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion.  
  
Basically, more time or more people doesn't always mean faster/better results .  
  
This is particularly evident in software development ðŸ‘‡  
  
- Microsoft's Windows Vista Development: The team behind Windows Vista was large, and the project faced significant delays and bloat. Despite having more resources and people, the complexity and coordination issues led to inefficiencies and a delayed release.  
  
- Google's 20% Time Policy: Initially intended to allow employees to spend 20% of their time on side projects, it led to many employees stretching tasks to fill their available time. Google eventually scaled back this policy because it led to inefficiencies and less focus on core projects.  
  
- Basecamp: The GOAT of bootstrapped SaaS. A successful software company that operates with a small, focused team. They attribute their productivity to keeping the team lean, allowing for faster decision-making and less time wasted on coordination.
