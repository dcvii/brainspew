Just out in Harvard Business Review, summary of the Hybrid Experiment results and lessons on how to make hybrid succeed.  
  
Experiment: randomize 1600 graduate employees in marketing, finance, accounting and engineering at [Trip.com](http://trip.com/) into 5-days a week in office, or 3-days a week in office and 2-days a week WFH. Analyzed 2 years of data.  
  
Two key results  
A) Hybrid and fully-in-office showed no differences in productivity, performance review grade, promotion, learning or innovation.  
B) Hybrid had a higher satisfaction rate, and 35% lower attrition. Quit-rate reductions were largest for female employees.  
  
Four managerial lessons  
1) Hybrid needs a strong performance management system so managers don’t need to hover over employees at their desks to check their progress. [Trip.com](http://trip.com/) had an extensive performance review process every six months.  
  
2) Coordinate in-office days at the team or company level. Schedule clarity prevents the frustration of coming to an empty office only to participate in Zoom calls. [Trip.com](http://trip.com/) coordinated WFH on Wednesday and Friday.  
  
3) Having leadership buy-in is critical (as with most management practices). [Trip.com](http://trip.com/)’s CEO and C-suite all support the hybrid policy.  
  
4) A/B test new policies (as well as products) if possible. Often new policies turn out to be unexpectedly profitable. [Trip.com](http://trip.com/) made millions of dollars more profits from hybrid by cutting expensive turnover.
