## What were the tribal affiliations of Arabs in the Palestine Mandate, TransJordan and Syria before 1948?

Before 1948, the Arab populations in the Palestine Mandate, Transjordan, and Syria were often organized along tribal lines, with affiliations playing a significant role in social, political, and economic life. These tribal affiliations were rooted in centuries-old kinship networks, nomadic and semi-nomadic traditions, and regional power dynamics. Below is an overview of the tribal affiliations in each region, based on historical records and anthropological studies up to 1948.Palestine Mandate In the Palestine Mandate (under British administration from 1920–1948), Arab society included both sedentary (urban and rural) and nomadic or semi-nomadic Bedouin populations. Tribal affiliations were more pronounced among Bedouin and rural communities, particularly in the Negev, Galilee, and Jordan Valley. Key tribal groups and confederations included:
- Negev and Southern Palestine:
	- Tiyaha (or Tayaha): One of the largest Bedouin confederations in the Negev, controlling areas around Beersheba. They were semi-nomadic, engaging in pastoralism and trade.
	- Tarabin: A major tribe in the Negev and Sinai, with influence extending to Gaza. They were known for their mobility and trade networks.
	- Azzazma: Another prominent Negev tribe, often allied with the Tiyaha, involved in grazing and seasonal agriculture.
	- Jabarat: Smaller tribe in the Negev, often subordinate to larger confederations like the Tiyaha.
	- Hanajira: Active in the Beersheba region, known for their role in local disputes and alliances.
- Galilee and Northern Palestine:
	- Hanadi: A Bedouin tribe in the Galilee, semi-nomadic and engaged in agriculture and herding.
	- Ghazawiyya: Present in the Hula Valley, known for their interactions with both Arab and Jewish communities.
	- Turkomen: Turkmen-origin tribes in the Jezreel Valley, semi-sedentary and involved in farming.
- Jordan Valley and Central Palestine:
	- Bani Sakhr: While primarily based in Transjordan, some branches extended into the Jordan Valley, engaging in trade and pastoralism.
	- Ta’amira: A semi-nomadic tribe around Bethlehem and Hebron, known for their pastoral and agricultural activities.
	- Jahalin: Bedouin tribe in the Judean Desert, east of Jerusalem, primarily nomadic.
Many Palestinian Arabs in urban areas (e.g., Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa) and settled villages were less tribally organized, identifying more with clans (hamulas) or regional affiliations. However, Bedouin tribes maintained distinct identities and often negotiated with Ottoman and British authorities for grazing rights and autonomy.Transjordan Transjordan (under British mandate, later the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan) was predominantly tribal, with Bedouin confederations dominating the social and political landscape. The Hashemite rulers relied on tribal alliances to govern. Major tribal groups included:
- Bani Sakhr: One of the most powerful confederations, controlling vast areas of central and southern Transjordan. They were semi-nomadic, with influence over trade routes and agriculture.
- Huwaytat (or Howeitat): Dominant in southern Transjordan (around Ma’an and Aqaba), known for their role in the Arab Revolt (1916–1918) alongside T.E. Lawrence.
- Adwan: Based in the Balqa region near Amman, they were influential in the early Hashemite administration and often rivaled the Bani Sakhr.
- Bani Hassan: A large confederation in northern Transjordan, semi-sedentary and engaged in agriculture and pastoralism.
- Sirhan: Nomadic Bedouin in eastern Transjordan, with ties to tribes in Syria and Iraq, controlling desert trade routes.
- Ruwala: A powerful Anaza confederation with influence in eastern Transjordan and Syria, known for their nomadic lifestyle and camel herding.
These tribes were organized into confederations, with sheikhs mediating disputes and negotiating with the Hashemite government. The Bani Sakhr and Huwaytat were particularly influential, often serving in the Arab Legion, Transjordan’s military force.Syria Syria, under French mandate (1920–1946), had a diverse Arab population with significant tribal affiliations, especially in rural and desert regions. Urban areas like Damascus and Aleppo were less tribally organized, but Bedouin and semi-nomadic tribes dominated the steppe and eastern regions. Key tribal groups included:
- Anaza Confederation: One of the largest Bedouin confederations, spanning Syria, Iraq, and Transjordan. Sub-tribes included:
	- Ruwala: Powerful in the Syrian Desert, with seasonal migrations into Transjordan and Iraq.
	- Wuld Ali: Another major Anaza branch, active in central Syria.
	- Hasana: Present in the Homs and Hama regions, semi-nomadic.
- Shammar Confederation: Rival to the Anaza, with influence in northeastern Syria (Jazira region). The Shammar were nomadic and controlled key trade routes to Iraq.
- Tayy (or Tai): Based in central and southern Syria, semi-nomadic and engaged in agriculture and herding.
- Fadl: A smaller tribe in the Hauran region, known for their role in local conflicts and alliances.
- Mawali: Nomadic tribe in the Damascus countryside, often in conflict with settled communities.
In the Hauran and Druze Mountain regions, tribes like the Druze clans and local Bedouin (e.g., Sardiyya) maintained distinct identities. The French administration often manipulated tribal rivalries to maintain control, particularly between the Anaza and Shammar.Common Characteristics Across Regions
- Tribal Structure: Tribes were organized into confederations, with sub-tribes and clans led by sheikhs. Loyalty was primarily to the tribe or clan, though alliances shifted based on resources, conflicts, or political needs.
- Nomadic vs. Sedentary: Bedouin tribes were nomadic or semi-nomadic, relying on pastoralism (camels, sheep, goats) and trade. Sedentary Arabs in villages and cities often retained clan-based identities but were less tribally organized.
- Interaction with Authorities: Tribes negotiated with Ottoman, British, and French authorities for land rights, grazing permissions, and political influence. In Transjordan, the Hashemites integrated tribes into governance; in Syria, the French exploited tribal divisions.
- Inter-Tribal Relations: Rivalries (e.g., Anaza vs. Shammar, Bani Sakhr vs. Adwan) and alliances shaped regional dynamics, often influencing conflicts over water, grazing lands, or trade routes.
Sources and Limitations This information draws from historical studies, Ottoman and British colonial records, and anthropological accounts of Arab tribal structures before 1948. Specific tribal affiliations can be complex due to fluid boundaries, intermarriage, and migration. Exact population figures or comprehensive lists of all tribes are difficult to verify, as records from the period are incomplete, and tribal identities were often orally transmitted. For further details, sources like the works of Norman Lewis (Nomads and Settlers in Syria and Jordan, 1800–1980) or British mandate reports provide valuable insights.If you’d like a deeper dive into a specific tribe, region, or source, let me know!

If you’d like, the **next step** could be:

  

➡️ **A map overlay showing tribal territories 1870–1948**, or

➡️ A **cross-reference of tribal alliances during key conflicts (WWI Arab Revolt, 1936 Arab Revolt, 1948 War).**

  

Which direction would you like?

Absolutely — I’ll give you **both**:

1. A **clear mental map-style geographic breakdown** of tribal territories ca. **1870–1948**, structured like a field intelligence overlay.
    
2. A **cross-referenced matrix of tribal alignments and behavior during major conflicts** (WWI Arab Revolt, 1936–39 Revolt, and 1948 War).
    

  

No modern politics — just historical structure.

## **Distance-to-Power Gradient**

  

**Tribes closest to state structures** (Jordan side):

- Bani Sakhr
    
- Howeitat
    
- Adwan
    
    → _These were ultimately integrated into the Hashemite military/patronage system._
    

  

**Tribes closest to Palestinian notability politics (Husseini vs Nashashibi):**

- Ta’amreh
    
- Jahalin
    
- Hanajira
    
    → _Played auxiliary roles but lacked centralized command._
    

  

**Tribes under French Mandate repression:**

- Ruwallah
    
- Nu’aym
    
- Druze
    
    → _Too constrained or fragmented to intervene in 1948._
