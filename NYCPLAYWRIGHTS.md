A collection of original monologues celebrating the unique challenge of writing for a solo performer and performing solo! This showcase originated as FLYING SOLO with producers Susan Frank and Rob Zonefrelli, directed by Betsy Kruse Craig. The Invisible Theatre has been a longtime proponent of original work and the name GOING IT ALONE was used decades ago for another monologue showcase with Susan Claassen. Managing Artistic Director, Betsy Kruse Craig brought the showcase back to IT in May of 2024. IT plans to make this an annual event, showcasing local and international playwrights. GRETCHEN WIRGES, IT Artistic Associate, will coordinate submissions.

  
Guidelines:  
- Must be original pieces by the playwright submitting
- Performance length – 5-7 minutes (anything longer will be disqualified).
- Monologues only. Must only require one actor on stage.
- Diversity and inclusivity highly encouraged!
- Compensation and Performance:
- Small honorarium paid to chosen playwrights
	- Chosen monologues will be cast with local actors and performed at Invisible Theatre
	- in Tucson Arizona in May of 2026.
  
Process:  

- All submissions will be read blind (without playwright info) by reading committee.
- Script curator will collect all numerical data and narrow the submissions down to 50
- and notify playwrights of making it to round 2.
- Script curator will read 2nd round plays and narrow it down to 25 based on committee
- scores, timing, and overall quality, and notify playwrights of making it to final round.
- Script curator and IT Executive Director will read final round monologues and
- determine which will be part of the 2026 show.
- All playwrights will be notified whether or not they have been selected.
- Chosen monologues will be cast and directed with local actors/directors.
  
Recommendations:  
- Monologues should not be one side of a conversation, pausing for the character to listen to a character we never see or hear.
- Sometimes monologues based on real people from history read like TED Talks, or rote history lessons. Instead of just listing dates and book titles, etc, let us hear what that person thinks, feels, believes, etc. How they’re affected by what’s going on around them.
- Some monologues included a full page preface with information/exposition on the character, what they look like, how old they are, and explicitly what the actor should look like, sound like, etc. If we need to know all of that in order to appreciate your piece you haven’t done the work to show us who this character is through their words/actions.

Email subject: “December 2025 Submission – \[Your Name\]”  
Send to: [editorliteraturetoday@gmail.com](https://www.nycplaywrights.org/)  
  

Seeking One-Minute Plays / Monologues: Up to 2 pieces (max 2 pages each)  
  
All work must be original and unpublished.

  
Simultaneous submissions accepted—please notify if accepted elsewhere.

  
Include a cover letter, third-person bio (≤50 words), and high-resolution photo.

  
Theme: “Offline: Reclaiming Presence in a Hyperconnected World”  
  
We are more connected than ever—yet so many of us feel unseen, unheard, or strangely alone.  
  
In an era of endless scrolling, algorithmic curation, performative identity, and digital ghosts, what does it mean to be truly present? To listen without recording? To remember without archiving? To feel without posting?  
  
For our December 2025 issue, Literature Today invites submissions that explore the quiet rebellion of going offline—not just as disconnection, but as reconnection: to self, to others, to the physical world, to silence, to slowness, to the unmediated moment.  
  
This theme is not anti-technology, but pro-humanity. We seek work that examines the tension between digital life and embodied existence—and celebrates the fragile, necessary acts of attention, intimacy, and stillness that resist erasure.  
  
Possible Angles (not prescriptive):  
  
1\. The Last Unrecorded Moment  
Moments lived fully without documentation—births, farewells, sunsets—experienced only through memory. What is gained (or lost) when we choose not to capture?  
Examples: A child’s first step unseen by a camera; a private grief never posted.  
  
2\. Digital Ghosts  
The spectral traces we leave online—abandoned accounts, unread messages, AI-generated “memories.” Who mourns a deleted profile?  
Examples: Logging into a dead friend’s social media; receiving an automated birthday wish from a defunct app.  
  
3\. Attention as Sanctuary  
The radical act of sustained focus in an age of distraction—reading a book cover to cover, listening without interrupting, watching clouds without checking the time.  
Examples: A student turning off notifications to study; a couple dining without phones.  
  
4\. The Myth of “Always On”  
The exhaustion of perpetual availability—work emails at midnight, instant replies expected, the guilt of silence. When does disconnection become self-preservation?  
Examples: A therapist’s burnout; a teen deleting all apps for a week.  
  
5\. Analog Rituals  
Everyday practices that resist digitization: handwriting letters, using paper maps, brewing tea without a timer, lighting a candle instead of flipping a switch.  
Examples: A grandmother teaching knitting; a writer using a typewriter.  
  
6\. Memory Before the Cloud  
Trusting the mind over external storage—recalling phone numbers, birthdays, recipes, or poems by heart. What happens when memory becomes muscle, not metadata?  
Examples: An elder reciting family history; a poet memorizing their own work.  
  
7\. The Body Remembers  
Sensations that cannot be digitized: the weight of a hand, the smell of rain on soil, the ache of hunger, the rhythm of breath during silence.  
Examples: A dancer’s muscle memory; a refugee remembering the taste of home.  
  
8\. Curated Selves vs. Lived Selves  
The gap between online personas and inner reality—highlight reels vs. hidden struggles, filtered faces vs. unmade beds.  
Examples: A influencer’s breakdown off-camera; a teen comparing real life to TikTok fantasy.  
  
9\. Generational Disconnect  
Elders who’ve never used smartphones; children who’ve never dialed a rotary phone. How do we bridge worlds when our tools of connection differ so radically?  
Examples: A grandfather confused by video calls; a child asking, “What’s a library card?”  
  

10\. Offline Communities  
Spaces where connection happens without Wi-Fi: neighborhood gardens, protest marches, choir rehearsals, AA meetings, subway commutes.  
Examples: Strangers sharing umbrellas in rain; a book club meeting in a café.  
  
11\. The Silence Between Notifications  
The rare, precious intervals of true quiet—when the phone is off, the screen is dark, and thought can unfold without interruption.  
Examples: Waking before dawn; sitting alone in a park at dusk.  
  
12\. Digital Detox as Rebellion  
Choosing to unplug not for wellness, but as political or existential resistance—to surveillance capitalism, algorithmic control, or the commodification of attention.  
Examples: A writer deleting social media; a family banning screens on Sundays.  
  
13\. Lost in the Feed  
The erosion of linear narrative—how endless scrolling fragments memory, identity, and time. Can we still tell our own stories when life feels like a highlight reel?  
Examples: A memoirist struggling to recall sequence; a teen whose diary is a Notes app.  
  
14\. The Future of Presence  
Speculative visions: Will future humans know solitude? Will AI companions replace human touch? What rituals might emerge to protect attention?  
  
Examples: A poem from 2125 about “the last person who read paper books”; a play set in a world without silence.

  
15\. Tending the Inner Signal  
  

Reconnecting with intuition, gut feelings, dreams—the internal “signal” drowned out by digital noise. How do we hear ourselves again?  
  
Examples: A woman quitting her job after a dream; a man meditating to “mute” his anxiety.  
  
These subthemes are designed to be literary, emotionally resonant, and culturally relevant, offering writers rich entry points into the central tension between digital saturation and embodied presence. They avoid technophobia while honoring the irreplaceable value of human-scale experience.  
  
Use them as inspiration—not constraints. We welcome work that interprets “Offline” in unexpected, poetic, or even paradoxical ways.  
  
Let your words be the flame that flickers—not the screen that glows.  
  
Why This Theme?  
  
As AI generates poetry, influencers monetize vulnerability, and virtual spaces replace public squares, literature remains one of the last sanctuaries for unfiltered human presence. This issue is a quiet manifesto: a space to unplug, reflect, and reclaim what cannot be streamed, liked, or saved—but only lived.

[SUBMISSION FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepPQphW0srgY4TuaxLqCKOqGCcdALcjXhzryktBTUPEZ8CRw/viewform?fbclid=IwY2xjawMpsn9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETF5MHIzOUZzWVpaU0JwanJDAR5WZZxTwP0KvT0Or-dMJEAX21K7E76P-fXN7Du4ZrJR1875tGDrLSMoyXWG2g_aem_HnVbNmVG3A9zcjm8ixafEg&fbzx=-36771803891199926)  
  
Atlanta Dramatists is producing The Solidarity Project: a Celebration of Historical Nonviolent Resistance. They seek plays ranging from 10 minutes to 30 minutes which illustrate nonviolent resistance throughout history and all over the world. For the purposes of this project, scripts should be inspired by events that occurred prior to 2015. The focus of this festival is history, and the overall themes will be hope and empowerment. Scripts may be historically accurate, historical fiction, historical fantasy, etc. provided they are inspired by actual events.  
  
The resistance depicted must be non-violent, but the play may contain violence in other aspects, such as if there were a violent reaction to a non-violent protest. Atlanta Dramatists is open to the use of music, puppetry, and dance as well as traditional “straight plays.” No projections or elaborate sets; this is a festival of plays that will all share the same set, though chairs, benches, blocks, and tables may be added or removed between pieces.  
  
Each script may utilize up to 5 actors. Unless ethnic specificity is vital to the plot, please allow for flexible yet diverse casting.  
  
Playwrights will receive royalties for the scripts selected. Performances will be at The Academy Theatre in Hapeville, GA, in 2026. (There is a chance the show will tour to other venues, as well.) Playwrights will receive 2 comp tickets. Playwrights may submit up to two scripts each.  
  
Some examples to inspire your research (but you’re not limited to these!):  
- Haiti 1946
- Indian Independence Movement
- Women of Liberia Mass Action For Peace
- South Africa: Anti-apartheid movement
- Scotland:
- Anti-nuclear power protests
- Holy Loch protests 1960-61
- Ireland:
- Irish Non-cooperation Movement
- 1879 Boycott (Irish Land League)

There is no submission charge and no obligation to participate if chosen. Plus, participants receive 50% of the box office. Artists are held to an audience guarantee equal to one ticket buyer per minute of your show.

Inaugural Playwriting Prize \[Vol. LII - "Gibbous" Issue\]  
  
Playwriting Prize: A competition for twenty-minute stage scripts. Only one playwriting piece will be accepted per issue. The final round will be judged by CMU Drama faculty (ranked #4 globally by The Hollywood Reporter in their 2025 list of best drama schools).

Editors’ Foreword:  
  
Having recently published our half-century issue, the Oakland Review is growing, working, waxing. Taken on its own, “gibbous” represents a concept still in the works, under construction, nearly-there. Perhaps this is what it means to live in a gibbous phase of the decade: something swollen, marked by tension and possibility. How do you—and your work—handle the half-light?

**The Green Room 42 presents CONNECTING DOT: A KINDRED REVUE on OCTOBER 23, 2025.**

  

CONNECTING DOT is an absurdist cabaret musical about the timeless existential crisis known as Jewish womanhood. Amy “Dot” Iaccarino is a starving actress moonlighting as a bartender in Hell’s Kitchen. On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, she is visited by a divine presence, and the encounter flourishes into a miraculous vaudeville revue starring her ancestors. Among them: a grandiose narcissist, a jazz-singing mafiosa, and a rebellious immigrant from the Old World. Dot begins to see herself in their stories and mannerisms, and comes to terms with the centuries-long conflicts that live on through her.  
  
Starring Dara Naomi Gallagher as Dot, with Alyssa “Alyx” Cassese, Kat Siciliano, Ruthy Froch, and Brooke Shapiro. Also featuring Yasmin Ranz-Lind, Claudia Cromley, Madhu Murali, Leah Raquel Petraglia, Zoë Parrish, and Courtney Martin-Cox.  
  

Produced by: Nancy Pop

### NYCPlaywrights seeks monologues.

**THE DEADLINE IS SUNDAY NOVEMBER 30, 2025 at 11:59 PM.  
**  
**The theme is "Black Woman Genius."  
**  
In November 2024, NYCPlaywrights began the " [Resisting Fascism](https://www.nycplaywrights.org/2024/11/nycplaywrights-seeks-monologues-and-10.html) " project. The winning piece was a monologue, [THE 92%](https://www.nycplaywrights.org/2025/03/the-92-by-bryan-keyth-wilson-video.html) by Bryan-Keyth Wilson that highlighted the fact that 92% of Black American women voters did not vote for Trump - and their intelligence and wisdom are [increasingly clear](https://archive.ph/CgpKo).  
  
The murder of Charlie Kirk was horrific, but that does not erase the fact that [he said hateful things like this:](https://archive.ph/fVzcw)  

> *“If we would have said three weeks ago \[...\] that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative-action picks, we would have been called racist. But now they're comin' out and they're saying it for us! They're comin' out and they're saying, "I'm only here because of affirmative action.  
>   
> Yeah, we know. You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person's slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.”*

Kirk [dropped out of community college](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxqnkwerj7o) to become a full-time political pundit, while the Black women he attacked graduated from [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Reid) and [Princeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama) and [Yale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Jackson_Lee).

And so this call for submissions seeks monologues on the theme of **Black Woman Genius**.

**SEMI-FINALIST SCRIPTS  
**  
NYCPlaywrights will select as semi-finalists as many of the scripts that we like and which meet the submission guidelines.  
  
The semi-finalists will be listed on this blog and an excerpt from each monologue (if permission is granted by the playwright) will be displayed in a blog post, one per day, along with any website links or other contact information the author wishes to share.  
  

The semi-finalist script selections will be announced **Sunday, January 4, 2026**.

  

**THE WINNING MONOLOGUE  
**  
The winning monologue will be selected from the semi-finalist monologues. The winning monologue will be recorded with an actor and an excerpt of the recording will be posted on NYCPlaywrights.org and on the [NYCPlaywrights YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nycplaywrights) (if permission is granted by the playwright) along with author and actor contact information, biographies, etc.  
  
The author of the winning monologue will receive an award of $100.  
  
The award-winner will be announced **Sunday, January 18, 2026**. Excerpts from the semi-finalist scripts will begin posting that day one monologue per day, and the winning monologue will be posted after all the semi-finalist monologues have been posted.

  

**💡 THE SUBMISSION GUIDELINES** **💡**

Failure to follow guidelines will result in your script being rejected.  
  
As always, there is no fee for submissions.

- **The deadline is November 30, 2025 at 11:59 PM EST.**
- All rights will remain with the playwright.
- Monologues must be no more than two pages long, using standard 12-point text size and line-spacing.
- Send only one monologue script per author to genius@nycplaywrights.org.
- The monologue script must be submitted by the author of the script, no agents or others may submit.
- The monologue script submission should be sent by email, with the script itself as a file attached to the email.
- The file format of the monologue script should be.pdf because it will retain your original script formatting.
- Make sure you have your name and your email address on the script.
- Plays can be submitted by anybody, from anywhere in the world but must be primarily in English (a few non-English phrases are acceptable, but the phrases must include English translations in production notes or stage directions.)
- A play that has had a production is acceptable.
- A play that has been published is not acceptable.
- There will be no money awarded for selected scripts except for the winning monologue.
- NYCPlaywrights' decisions are final.
- Any questions email info@nycplaywrights.org

PLEASE NOTE: when you submit your play, you should get an automatic response that says:

  

> \*\*\*

> > Thank you for sending your monologue to the NYCPlaywrights “BLACK WOMAN GENIUS” project.  
> >   
> > The semi-finalist script selections will be announced Sunday, January 4, 2026.  
> >   
> > The award-winner will be announced Sunday, January 18, 2026.  
> >   
> > Nancy at NYCPlaywrights

>   
> 
> \*\*\*
> 
>   

If you don't receive the automatic response, email us at info@nycplaywrights.org to check if we received your script.

**Please note:**

- The monologues must be dramatic - we love facts, but the monologue must not simply be a lecture on some aspect of history or current events. A *dramatic* monologue should have an emotional impact and often will tell a story. We'd like to see creativity and invention.
- The call for submissions is open to any person, anywhere in the world.
- Although the theme is Black Woman Genius, the character speaking in the monologue does not necessarily have to be a Black woman.
- Although this is a serious subject, you do not have to be grim. We welcome humor and playfulness, and we are just as interested in hopeful monologues, and anticipating a brighter future as much as we are in the injustices of the past and present.

  

**DATE RECAP**

- November 30, 2025 - submission deadline
- January 4, 2026 - semi-finalists announced
- January 18, 2026 - the winning monologue will be announced and then each day an excerpt from one of the semi-finalist monologues will be posted.

This ten-session course is a combination of lecture, reading, writing prompts, discussion, and most importantly, in-class sharing of your work for feedback. All levels welcome.

We accept previously unpublished fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, scripts for the stage or screen, translation, artwork, and illustrated narrative through our Submittable submission manager.

Simultaneous submissions are always welcome. We only ask that you withdraw your piece as soon as you accept another opportunity.

As a compendium of the rare, intriguing, and unheard, we’re looking for quality writing that is thought-provoking and literary. We are especially interested in work that explores the identities and experiences of writers from the Delta region, BIPOC, immigrant, LGBTQ+, women, disabled, and neurodivergent writers, the resource-poor, writers over 50, those who have experienced or been impacted by incarceration, or anyone whose voices have traditionally been silenced.

Scripts: We’re committed to publishing genres not often featured in literary journals. Whether it’s a 10-minute play or a scene from a screenplay, we’re looking for polished scripts with compelling character motivation and innovative use of dialogue.

We're looking for polished scripts that illuminate truths and push boundaries. We accept ten-minute plays and scripts that are 20-pages or under.

**Deadline: October 15, 2025**

Or until they have received 150 submissions

[Submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuQ0Qc60vhcIiBfVqyVLxSe661Tghz5BwMMyg6xX0dkbbFdw/viewform)

Submissions for some scripts issue 6: nostalgia are open now until 10/15/25 or until 150 submissions, whichever comes first. As always, submissions are free for everyone!

"nostalgia" means a lot... literally. I want to read scripts about aestheticizing Y2K, of cringe millennial culture, of looking back through time, of characters having a moment of self-reflection to see how far (or not) they've come. Give me your nerdiest shit, your grief, your weirdness. Stuff that can never be staged and stuff that has been staged. Plays about memes and emojis and the internet of old. Discord and radio and Zoom plays welcome. I want to see all facets of nostalgia at play and creativity in terms of technology use.

Accepted pieces will be published in an ebook and POD (print-on-demand) physical book. All accepted contributors will receive a token $10 payment; unfortunately, some scripts does not have the funds to pay more even though your work absolutely deserves it. <3

GUIDELINES:

Scripts can be no longer than 45 pages (one-act).

Essays and theatre reviews can be no longer than 1500 words.

Absolutely nothing racist, sexist, homo/transphobic, fascist, imperialist, anti-vax, etc. Get that shit out of here. You can, however, engage with these as themes in your work; if you glorify them, your submission will be rejected on sight.

Any genre is fair game. Sci-fi, fantasy, dystopian, utopian, realism, etc.

**Testimonials**

  

> "Writer's block is real! Sarah helped me get out of my own way. Through our relaxing conversations and visualization exercises, I was able to get out of my head. She's extremely positive and encouraging. We collaborated on my film script. She provided concise feedback and was able to punch up my script with her humor and poise, and bring it to the next level. As a result, my short film has been selected as a finalist in a film festival! I'm so grateful for Sarah's help. You can't go wrong trusting in Sarah!"

  

> *\--- Caryn Whitman, CPA, CEO & President of Vasana Ventures*

  

> "I had a breakthrough in my playwriting after working with Sarah. Her coaching made me realize I had the bad habit of undermining the power of my words.. I saw that after she pointed out one line in my play BIG FAT BABY IN HIS MOTHER'S ARMS which I went on to rewrite immediately and submitted for a serious Playwrights Fellowship. Just yesterday I heard from the UCROSS Foundation that I am the Alternate Fellow in the event one of the winners cannot attend in Spring 2025. I am honored to be acknowledged for the Fellowship and thank Sarah for her important coaching. Sarah will have you grow as a playwright/screenwriter in front of her eyes."

**Deadline: November 17, 2025  
**  

At The Theater Project’s annual virtual one-act play competition, 7 to 10 short plays are selected for 3 pre-recorded broadcast performances. The goal is to give emerging writers in NJ and beyond the chance to platform their work!  
  
After each broadcast, the audience will vote for their favorite play. After the final performance, judges will award Best Play, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Audience Favorite (Play) certificates.  
  
The $500 Grand Prize is given to the playwright selected by the judges at the final performance.  
- Email your script to [OneActFest@TheTheaterProject.org](https://www.nycplaywrights.org/) with the required acknowledgement (below) between October 1, 2025, and November 17, 2025.
- One entry per writer ONLY.
- Online submissions only.
- No submission fee required.
- You MUST include the following acknowledgement in the body of your email: “If my play is accepted and I choose to take part in the festival, I understand that I will be responsible for the casting and rehearsal of my play and that I will be charged a $100 participation fee.”
  

Questions? Email [OneActFest@TheTheaterProject.org.](https://www.thetheaterproject.org/)  
  
Submission Requirements

  

Dramas and comedies accepted.  
Maximum 15 minutes running time. Plays that exceed 15 minutes will not be considered.  
  
Zoom Performances

Live talkbacks with playwrights follow the evening performances  
All ticket buyers vote electronically for Audience Favorite Play at the conclusion of each performance and receive links to all talkbacks and the awards announcement.  
Nominations and winners for Best Actor, Actress, and Director, Audience Favorite (Play), and Judges' $500 Prize are announced post-show Sunday afternoon at our virtual cocktail party (BYOB;D)  
  
How It Works

If your play is selected, The Theater Project will supply a stage manager/technical director to oversee the Zoom recording process.  
Individual playwrights supply the actors and directors and make their own agreements regarding actor and director compensation.  
Production Fee: $100. Participating playwrights (finalists) will be charged a $100 fee to cover the $500 prize as well as the cost of hiring the stage manager/technical director.  
Playwrights invited to participate must have plays that are ready to perform and supply their own actors and directors who are recorded via Zoom by The Theater Project.  
  
Why a production fee?  
  
The Theater Project does not charge a submission fee for its THINK FAST festival. We do, however, charge a $100 production fee to help cover the cost of the $500 prize as well as the hiring of a stage manager/technical director to work with the productions on their technical needs, supervise a rehearsal, and record the final performance on TTP’s Zoom platform.  
  
While we’d rather not charge a fee, we would be unable to offer this showcase without help from participating playwrights. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility!
