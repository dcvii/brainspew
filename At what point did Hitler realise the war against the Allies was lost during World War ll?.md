There’s a story—maybe true—that says a lot. During the bombing of Germany, American bombers were getting hit hard. The problem? Their fighter planes couldn’t fly far enough to protect them deep into enemy territory. The Germans knew this. They waited until the fighters turned back, then attacked the bombers. It was brutal. But when the bombers had fighter cover the whole way, things changed fast. Losses dropped, and the bombing started to work. That moment wasn’t just about tactics—it was a sign the war was turning, and it was turning high up in the sky.

But once the North American Aviation p51 Mustang, a fighter with sufficient range to protect the bombers all the way to Berlin and back entered the war the story changed

The first time Herman Goering saw the p51 over Berlin he is quoted as saying “ The game is up”. Which means they had no effective defense against the allied strategic bombing. Germany could not stop the allies from pounding them into dust.

And effectively the air war over Germany was lost.

There is also a turning point on the Eastern front that effectively destroyed so much German Armour and Artillery that they could no longer mount offensive military operations especially against the growing number of soviet tanks and planes. It was the Battle of Kursk. The germans attacked in force, but the russians know when and where they were coming ( another great story here) and built an extensive defense in depth, which wore down the germans at a far greater rate than planned. After the first day, the german generals realized, after reviewing there losses and the cost of the battle ahead, that this battle and subsequently the war on the Eastern front was lost or would soon turn into a stalemate. Which, would then become a war of numbers ( Tanks, planes and guns) that they could not win. They Germans could not match the combined industrial war production of Russia and the allies. Remember the Allies were shipping vast amount of military aid to the western / Eastern front.
