The recent court filing referring to "the court filing against DOGE" appears to be the Justice Department's January 16, 2026, "Notice of Corrections to the Record" in the ongoing lawsuit AFSCME v. SSA (filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, case involving unions like AFSCME, AFT, and others challenging DOGE's access to Social Security Administration (SSA) data). This filing was submitted by the government (DOJ representing defendants including SSA) to correct prior misrepresentations or inaccuracies in the record about DOGE employees' handling of sensitive SSA data.This is not a new lawsuit "against" DOGE but an update in an existing one (initiated in February 2025 by labor unions and advocates to block or limit DOGE/SSA data access, citing privacy violations under laws like the Privacy Act). The filing admits prior denials were incorrect and reveals improper actions by DOGE team members at SSA.Key details from the filing and related reporting:
- DOGE employees (embedded at SSA) shared sensitive Social Security data (including personally identifiable information/PII) via an unauthorized third-party server (Cloudflare), violating SSA security protocols and potentially a March 20, 2025, temporary restraining order.
- One DOGE team member signed a "Voter Data Agreement" with an unidentified political advocacy group (aimed at finding voter fraud evidence to potentially overturn election results in certain states), in their capacity as an SSA employee. This involved requests to analyze state voter rolls using SSA data.
- Another instance: A DOGE staffer sent an encrypted, password-protected file (believed to contain names/addresses of ~1,000 people from SSA systems) to Steve Davis (described as a senior adviser to DOGE, also a Department of Labor employee).
- SSA made Hatch Act violation referrals regarding two unnamed DOGE employees involved in the advocacy group interactions.
- The filing notes these actions were discovered via SSA's review of records starting in/after October 2025.
Named individuals or entities in this specific filing:
- The DOGE employees involved in the improper sharing and the voter data agreement are not named/publicly identified in the filing (described generically as "DOGE team members" or "then-SSA DOGE Team").
- Steve Davis is explicitly referenced as the recipient of one encrypted file containing suspected SSA-derived PII.
- Broader context: DOGE is led/influenced by Elon Musk (and formerly Vivek Ramaswamy), but neither is named in this particular SSA-related correction filing. Other lawsuits challenge DOGE/Musk more directly (e.g., Appointments Clause violations or FACA transparency issues), naming Musk, Trump (official capacity), agencies like OMB/OPM/Treasury, or DOGE itself.
Other lawsuits involve DOGE (e.g., challenges to its structure, data access at Treasury/OPM, or grant terminations), but the most prominent recent filing matching "court filing against DOGE" (with widespread January 2026 coverage) is this DOJ/SSA correction in the Maryland privacy/data access case.For the primary document: See the linked PDF in sources like courtlistener.com (gov.uscourts.mdd.577321/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321.197.0.pdf). If this doesn't match what you meant, provide more details (e.g., date, court, or parties) for clarification!

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led initially by Elon Musk (with Vivek Ramaswamy co-leading early on before departing), was a temporary initiative established by executive order on January 20, 2025, to modernize federal technology, cut waste, and reduce bureaucracy. It operated until around mid-2026 (with its charter set to expire on July 4, 2026), though its centralized structure wound down earlier amid leadership changes and controversies.DOGE's size varied over time and depended on how one defines the "team":
- Core/central DOGE staff (often referred to as the U.S. DOGE Service or USDS, the reorganized entity where DOGE was embedded, plus direct White House/oversight roles):
	- Early 2025 reports (e.g., from the Washington Post) described about 90 employees, with roughly half inherited from the prior U.S. Digital Service.
	- A March 2025 sworn declaration from DOGE administrator Amy Gleason stated 89 employees with no formal front office or org chart.
	- Other sources cited around 30 (e.g., in White House DOGE office contexts amid early controversies) to 50 (e.g., Politico reporting on initial assembly in late 2024/early 2025, many from Musk's companies like SpaceX).
	- By mid-2025, some estimates reached 79 appointed employees plus 10 seconded from other agencies (Guardian), or more than 70–100 tracked by outlets like the New York Times and ProPublica (with roughly 40 tied to Musk personally).
	- In a March 2025 interview, Musk mentioned around 100 employees with plans to expand to 200.
- Embedded "DOGE teams" across federal agencies:
	- Per the founding executive order (E.O. 14158), each agency head was required to establish a DOGE team of at least four employees (typically a team lead, engineer, HR specialist, and attorney), who could include special government employees. These were embedded in agencies to implement DOGE's agenda.
	- For example, at the Social Security Administration (SSA) (relevant to prior court filings), the DOGE team consisted of 10 members (four special government employees and six detailees from elsewhere), per SSA CIO declarations in March 2025 court records. This was one of the larger embedded units reported.
DOGE was never a massive bureaucracy itself—intentionally small and agile, relying on young engineers (often from Musk-affiliated companies), tech experts, and some experienced aides like Steve Davis. Many staff transitioned to full-time agency roles later, and the effort shifted toward tech modernization rather than broad cuts after early pushback. Exact totals fluctuated due to its decentralized, temporary nature and lack of full public disclosure.If you're referring to a specific phase, agency, or aspect (e.g., the SSA-embedded team from the recent court filing), let me know for more targeted details!
