## Trum HHS

The NYT's coverage of the Trump HHS cuts contains serious inaccuracies.  
  
Just looking at their claims about the NIH cuts, it becomes clear they are misrepresenting the data. Let me count the ways:

1/ First of all, the "disease-to-funding" mapping presented in the chart is heavily dramatized & misleading.  
  
For example - NIH funded research for heart disease research, as of now, doesn't live in one institute - it spans at least 6 different NIH centers + external agencies!  
  
The chart's neat 1:1 mapping exists only in the graphic designer's imagination... not in how medical research actually works.  
  
(Data: NIH RCDC database; 2024 spending)  

2/ The NYT decries: "Kennedy cut 390 chronic disease grants!"  
  
But NIH data actually shows that the FY2024 budget funded 12,600+ active chronic disease projects, with cuts hitting just a fraction of each of the number of grants given out to these chronic disease areas.  
  
It's as if... they just completely ignored the relevance of the denominator here.  

3/ The NYT also goes on to claim "$170 million in cancer cuts will delay cures and cost lives."  
  
...but cancer research gets $7+ billion annually from NIH. That's a 2.4% trim to one of the best-funded disease areas in medical research!

4/ The NYT also plainly overlooks how cancer research funding actually works - it comes from all sorts of NIH sources.  
  
A 2020 Lancet Oncology analysis showed that of the 59 cancer drugs approved 2010-2016, only 31% of underlying NIH funding came from NCI. The other 69% came from immunology, endocrinology, and other institutes.  
  
Source:  (Cleary EG, Ledley FD. "NIH funding for research underlying new cancer therapies.")

5/ The NYT claims DEI cuts were "only 7%" of terminations, implying most cuts hit regular medical research. But they don't explain their methodology, and the number is easily manipulated depending on how you slice the data.  
  
As an example, I went through the GrantWatch data myself and found:  
  
• Title keywords only: 6.5% of canceled dollars  
• Add those same keywords to abstracts: 26.4%  
• Include disparity terms (LGBTQ, racial, minority, underserved): 36.8%  
• Add community health terms (behavioral, socioeconomic, rural): 74.6%  
  
The point here isn't that 75% instead of 7% is the "real" number - it's that the NYT \*seems\* to have cherry picked the narrowest possible definition of DEI to make systematic targeting look like a rounding error.  

Cutting NIH funding by 37% is a legitimate concern worth debating. I know researchers whose labs have been hit by these cuts, and the human cost is real.  
  
But this shock-value journalism uses manipulated percentages, misleading disease funding maps, and emotional death counts to maximize outrage rather than inform. One afternoon of fact-checking pokes serious holes in their claims.

\*Correction: this chart includes grants with frozen funding & "possibly resumed" in along with "terminated grants". The true count of terminated grants is even smaller.
