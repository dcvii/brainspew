### And why it all started in China in November 2025

In November 2025, something extraordinary happened in Hong Kong that most people missed entirely. China issued $4 billion worth of bonds denominated in US dollars; a routine financial transaction on its surface. But when the orders came in, they totaled $118 billion. Thirty times oversubscribed. Investors from around the world were practically trampling each other to buy Chinese government debt.

Here’s the part that should make everyone pay attention: these Chinese bonds began trading at “lower yields” than United States Treasury bonds. Read that again slowly. Global investors were accepting lower returns on Chinese debt than on American debt—despite China holding a lower credit rating (A+ versus America’s AA). In the hierarchy of global finance, this is roughly equivalent to a challenger brand outselling Coca-Cola at a higher price. It simply doesn’t happen. Until it did.

One month later, the United States began mobilizing for potential intervention in Venezuela. If you think these events are unrelated, you’re missing the most important geopolitical story of our generation. This is about the slow-motion collapse of the architecture that has supported American power for half a century: the dollar’s role as the world’s dominant reserve currency. And Venezuela, improbably, has become ground zero in the fight to preserve it.

The Dollar’s Exorbitant Privilege

To understand what’s at stake, we need to grasp what former French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing famously called America’s “exorbitant privilege.”\[^1\] Since the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, and especially after the 1973 arrangement with Saudi Arabia that created the “petrodollar,” the US dollar has functioned as the world’s primary reserve currency. This status grants the United States an almost supernatural economic power.

When you need dollars to buy oil, settle international debts, or participate in global trade, you create automatic demand for American currency. This demand allows the US government to borrow at lower interest rates than any other nation, effectively financing its deficits by printing money that the world is compelled to use. It’s the economic equivalent of owning the toll booth on every major highway in the global economy. The Congressional Research Service estimates this privilege saves the US government between $100-250 billion annually in borrowing costs.\[^2\]

More importantly, dollar dominance became America’s most powerful geopolitical weapon. Control the dollar system, and you control access to the global economy. Step out of line, and the United States can cut you off from SWIFT (the international banking communication network), freeze your reserves held in dollars, or impose sanctions that amount to economic excommunication. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the US demonstrated this power decisively, and for years, it seemed unassailable.

But empires, like species, rarely see their own extinction coming.

The Quiet Revolution

The Chinese bond issuance in Hong Kong represents something far more significant than a successful fundraising exercise. According to analysis from JP Morgan and the World Gold Council, this wasn’t about raising capital at all; China has over $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.\[^3\] This was a proof of concept, a demonstration to the world that an alternative to the dollar system isn’t just possible, it’s already here and functioning.

Consider the mechanics: China raises dollars through bond sales, then uses those dollars to finance Belt and Road Initiative projects across developing nations. But here’s the twist, they’re structuring repayments in renminbi (RMB), not dollars. It’s financial judo, using the opponent’s strength against them. Take Argentina as an example. Since 2023, Argentina has been repaying portions of its International Monetary Fund debts using RMB obtained through currency swap agreements with China.\[^4\] The dollar goes in one door and exits through another, while the RMB quietly expands its footprint.

The numbers tell a stark story. According to the International Monetary Fund’s COFER (Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves) data, the dollar’s share of global reserves has declined from 65.3% in 2016 to 59.3% by Q3 2024, the most sustained decline since data collection began in 1995.\[^5\] That might sound modest, but in the glacial world of reserve currencies, this is a sprint. For context, the British pound’s decline from dominance took roughly forty years, from 1913 to the 1950s. Modern financial infrastructure; digital payment systems, bilateral swap arrangements, and central bank digital currencies; could compress this timeline dramatically.

Meanwhile, China’s Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) processed an average of 9.6 trillion yuan daily in 2024, representing 65% year-over-year growth.\[^6\] The system now connects over 1,700 financial institutions across 180 countries. This isn’t peripheral infrastructure; it’s a parallel financial nervous system being built in real-time, and it’s gaining capabilities with each passing quarter.

Enter Venezuela: The Petrodollar’s Existential Threat

Which brings us, inexorably, to Venezuela. On the surface, American interest in this South American nation might seem driven by concerns about authoritarianism or humanitarian crisis. Dig deeper, and you’ll find something more fundamental: Venezuela represents an existential threat to the petrodollar system, and by extension, to American global power itself.

Venezuela possesses the world’s largest proven oil reserves; 303 billion barrels, exceeding even Saudi Arabia’s 298 billion.\[^7\] And since 2018, Venezuela has sold 100% of its oil exports to China, with transactions settled in yuan, not dollars.\[^8\] Moreover, Venezuela became an official BRICS+ partner nation in 2024, gaining access to the bloc’s alternative payment systems, development financing, and diplomatic protection.

Here’s what makes this particularly dangerous from Washington’s perspective: Venezuela isn’t just surviving outside the dollar system; it’s functioning. Despite what the US Treasury Department characterizes as “unprecedented sanctions,” Venezuela has maintained oil production, secured financing, and sustained trade relationships. It’s become a living, breathing advertisement that the dollar system is optional, not mandatory.

The historical pattern is unmistakable. Iraq in 2000 announced it would accept only euros for its oil; Saddam Hussein was removed from power three years later.\[^9\] Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi proposed a gold-backed pan-African currency to replace the dollar for oil transactions; NATO intervened in 2011.\[^10\] Iran has sold oil in currencies other than dollars since 2012 and faces continuous sanctions pressure and repeated threats of military action.\[^11\] The message couldn’t be clearer: abandon the petrodollar, face consequences.

Venezuela is simply the latest chapter in this pattern, with one crucial difference: it has China’s economic backing and BRICS institutional support. The timing of US military mobilization; just one month after China’s Hong Kong bond proved the viability of dollar alternatives; is no accident. It’s the empire’s immune system responding to a pathogen it recognizes as lethal.

The Domino Effect: Why One Country Matters

The fear in Washington isn’t limited to Venezuela itself. It’s about the precedent and the dominos that might follow. Brazil, South America’s largest economy, is already a full BRICS member and conducts 25-30% of its China trade in local currencies.\[^12\] Argentina, despite its recent political shifts, continues repaying IMF debts in RMB and maintains substantial currency swap arrangements with Beijing. According to a 2025 Bank of China survey, 77% of ASEAN businesses now prefer RMB financing for trade with China.\[^13\]

If Venezuela succeeds as a BRICS partner in America’s traditional sphere of influence; its own backyard under the Monroe Doctrine; the psychological and practical barriers preventing other nations from making the same choice crumble. Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and other resource-rich Latin American nations would have a template for economic independence from Washington. The Western Hemisphere, long considered America’s uncontested domain, could pivot toward the BRICS economic architecture.

Geopolitically, this would be catastrophic for US influence. Economically, it would accelerate the unraveling of the petrodollar system that has funded American power for five decades. When former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger arranged the 1973 agreement with Saudi Arabia to price oil exclusively in dollars, he understood he was building a foundation for American hegemony that transcended military might.\[^14\] That foundation is now cracking, and Venezuela sits on one of the most significant fault lines.

The Multipolar Moment

We’re witnessing something historians will likely mark as an inflection point: the transition from a unipolar, dollar-dominated world to a multipolar, multi-currency system. The BRICS+ coalition now represents 45% of global population, 35% of global GDP (measured in purchasing power parity), and 30% of global oil production.\[^15\] These aren’t marginal players; they’re building parallel institutions that rival Western-dominated ones.

The New Development Bank, headquartered in Shanghai, has issued over $32 billion in loans, with an increasing share denominated in local currencies rather than dollars.\[^16\] The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank announced plans to open a Hong Kong office in 2026, further cementing the city’s role as an offshore RMB hub.\[^17\] These institutions offer developing nations what the IMF and World Bank have long provided; but without political conditionality and with currency options that reduce dollar dependency.

Perhaps most telling is the behavior of central banks. Emerging market central banks have been accumulating gold at a pace not seen since the 1960s, with purchases reaching 634 tonnes in the first nine months of 2025 alone.\[^18\] When central banks diversify away from dollar reserves into gold at this velocity, they’re essentially voting with their vaults. They’re preparing for a world where the dollar is one option among several, not the only option that matters.

The Choice Ahead

The Chinese bond issuance and the Venezuela escalation are two sides of the same coin;quite literally. One demonstrates that economic alternatives to dollar hegemony are viable and attractive. The other tests whether the United States can still enforce dollar dominance through the threat or application of military power.

The outcome will help answer the defining geopolitical question of our era: Can the United States accept a multipolar currency world where it remains powerful but no longer dominant? Or will it fight; economically, politically, and potentially militarily; to preserve the unipolar system that has served it so well since 1945?

History suggests that hegemonic powers rarely cede dominance gracefully. The British Empire fought two world wars in part to maintain the pound sterling’s global role. The transition was ultimately inevitable, but it was neither smooth nor peaceful. Today’s transition carries its own dangers, amplified by nuclear weapons, interconnected global supply chains, and the speed at which financial contagion can spread in digital markets.

Yet there’s also an opportunity here, though it requires a shift in thinking that may prove psychologically difficult for American policymakers. A multipolar currency system could actually enhance global stability by reducing the “weaponization” of finance that has accelerated in recent years. When economic exclusion becomes less existential, when alternatives exis, nations have less incentive to view every disagreement as a fight for survival.

Following the Money

The next time you hear about US foreign policy in Venezuela, look past the stated justifications about democracy and human rights. Those are just a fake front. Follow the money instead. Follow the oil. Follow the currency used to price that oil. And follow the emerging network of nations building an alternative to the system America has dominated for seventy-five years.

China’s $4 billion bond, oversubscribed by a factor of thirty, announced to the world that the exit door from the dollar system isn’t just unlocked, it’s wide open and the view outside looks increasingly attractive. Venezuela walked through that door. The question now is whether the United States will try to drag it back by force, and what that choice will cost in an already fragmenting world order.

The empire isn’t ending with a bang. It’s ending with a bond prospectus and an oversubscription rate that tells us everything we need to know about which way the wind is blowing. Pay attention. This is history happening in real-time, and Venezuela is just the opening move in a much larger game.
