### The Mooch Report—January 6, 2026

Well, the New Year certainly started out with a bang with news of a stunning raid that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in the dead of night on January 3.

Most sources say it was the Army’s elite Delta Force that flew to the “X” and grabbed Maduro and his wife before they were able to seal themselves into a safe room at Fort Tiuna in Caracas. No US military personnel were killed in the operation, though there are reports that several operators were wounded.

Team Mooch was on the case just hours after a White House press conference outlining the operation, [with a quick hit to bring everyone up to speed](https://youtu.be/Yara7bqRem0?si=WLCnFLbWygtpiVBQ) on what went down and what’s supposed to come after.

And that’s where the rubber meets the road. There are lots of question around the post Absolute Resolve Venezuela, so we brought back our friend Antonio Bricio to give us some deep intel on where this is all headed.

Unfortunately the MOOCHIE Awards were a bit overshadowed by the Venezuela raid, but we did indeed deliver the honors on New Year’s Eve! Be sure to watch the **[MOOCHIE Awards Encore](https://www.youtube.com/live/0Xt47ZRaBQ4?si=-e_Ldi4_R9KN_NuF)** to see who earned Guest of the Most Viewed Episode and Guest of the Year…

Former Mexican air force pilot and Latin American expert Antonio Bricio joins Mooch for in-depth analysis of Operation Absolute Resolve, the U.S. military strike on Venezuela that resulted in the abduction of President Nicolas Maduro, and a discussion about what happens next now that President Trump has claimed that his administration is going to run the country.

Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Ted LeClair joins the channel to talk about whether the newly announced Trump Class battleship is a good idea and what the average American citizen should know about the fleet.

While speaking to an auditorium full of every US Navy three and four star admirals at Quantico back in September, President Trump said he wanted to bring battleships back to the American fleet.  
  
The remark was dismissed by navalists the same way they dismissed his order to return Ford Class carriers to steam catapults, but yesterday at Mar a Lago the president along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the U.S. Navy intends to build two new battleships—the Trump Class—as part of the “Golden Fleet” effort.
