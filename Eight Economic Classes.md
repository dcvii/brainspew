Here:

There are eight classes.

Indigent:  
I cannot work at a job. I cannot take care of myself. If nobody helps me, I’ll starve. I can’t afford a football.

Poor:  
I can work at a job, but I can’t keep a steady job. I can take care of myself but just barely. I can afford a football, but I don’t have time to play.

Middle Class:  
I can work at a job, and I can hold a steady job. I can take care of myself and I can take care of my family. I can help an indigent person become poor. But I can’t make a poor person become middle class. I can buy footballs for my kids and enjoy watching them play.

Upper Class:  
I can work at a steady job, save money, take vacations. I can take care of myself easily. I can make a poor person middle class. I can buy season tickets for my favorite football games.

Rich:  
I could work at a steady job, but I don’t need to. I have enough money to take care myself, my family without ever working again. I can make a poor person middle class. I could, with some luck, make a middle class person upper class. I made my money playing pro football.

Wealthy:  
I have so much money, that my primary job is to manage that money and invest it properly. I have enough money to make anyone rich. Taking care of myself is trivial. The difficult part is to make my money work the way I want to make change, but I pretty much only understand one industry - where I made my money. I could buy a pro football team.

Very Wealthy:  
I manage my money with the a team of professionals. I need to take care of my investments. Mostly by buying and selling businesses in several different industries. I could buy every pro football team in the country, but is that really the best use of my wealth?

Ultra Wealthy:  
I’m one of the wealthiest people on the planet. How I manage my money affects multiple industries both in this country and around the world. I mostly work with governments so that I can maintain stability in their economies. If I fail, everyone fails. Football? Get serious.
