The death toll from a powerful explosion at Iran’s biggest port, Bandar Abbas, has risen to at least 60, with more than 700 people injured, state media reported on Sunday, as firefighters worked to fully extinguish the fire.

Saturday’s blast took place in the Shahid Rajaee section of the port, Iran’s biggest container hub, shattering windows for several kilometers around, tearing metal strips off shipping containers and badly damaging goods inside, state media said.

The incident occurred as Iran held a third round of nuclear talks with the United States in Oman.

Chemicals at the port were suspected to have fueled the explosion, but the exact cause was not clear and Iran’s Defense Ministry denied international media reports that the blast may be linked to the mishandling of solid fuel used for missiles.

A spokesperson for the ministry told state TV the reports were “aligned with enemy psy-ops \[psychological operations\],” saying that the blast-hit area did not contain any military cargo.

The Associated Press cited British security firm Ambrey as saying the port received sodium perchlorate in March, which is used to propel ballistic missiles and whose mishandling could have led to the explosion.

The UK Financial Times newspaper reported in January the shipment of two Iranian vessels from China containing enough of the ingredient to propel as many as 260 mid-range missiles, helping Tehran replenish its stocks following its direct missile attacks on its arch-foe Israel in 2024.

Plumes of black smoke rose above the site on Sunday, and pieces of twisted metal and debris lay scattered across the blast area.

By early afternoon, the head of Iran’s Red Crescent Society told state media the fire was 90% extinguished, and officials said port activities had resumed in unaffected parts of Shahid Rajaee.

Iran’s crisis management organization said that of the 752 people who had received treatment for their injuries, 190 were still being treated in medical centers early on Sunday.

A spokesperson for the country’s crisis management organization appeared on Saturday to blame the explosion on poor storage of chemicals in containers at Shahid Rajaee, adding that earlier warnings had highlighted potential safety risks.

Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani cautioned against “premature speculation,” saying final assessments would be shared after the investigation.

Negligence has often been blamed in a series of deadly incidents that have hit Iranian energy and industrial infrastructure in recent years.

These have included refinery fires, a gas explosion at a coal mine, and an emergency repair incident at Bandar Abbas that killed one worker in 2023.

The Iranian government declared that Monday would be a day of mourning for those affected by the port explosion in Bandar Abbas. Iranian government spokesperson Fatima Mohajerani wrote on X/Twitter on Sunday.
