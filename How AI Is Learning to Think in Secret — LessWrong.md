How AI Is Learning to Think in Secret — LessWrong

[^1]: Fun fact: King Alfred is the 33rd great-grandfather of Britain's current monarch, Charles III. As for the translation itself, contemporary prefaces name Alfred as translator, though his actual involvement is debated. The Oxford Alfredian Boethius Project suggests it likely emerged from his educational reform program rather than his personal pen, given that he reportedly learned Latin in his late 30s while simultaneously fighting Viking invasions.

[^2]: [Interestingly](https://www.michiganpublic.org/arts-culture/2013-10-27/the-changing-meanings-of-nice-and-silly), the word “nice” made a similar journey in reverse. When English imported it from French in the 1300s, it meant “foolish” (from Latin nescius, “ignorant”). Imagine the confusion if you could time-travel.

\>”What a nice fellow!”

\>”Did you just call me stupid?”

[^4]: An earlier version of this section mentioned inference-time costs alongside training efficiency. Training efficiency appears to be the more fundamental barrier, so I've de-emphasized the inference discussion. Thanks to [@Brendan Long](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/brendan-long?mention=user) for the correction

[^5]: Thanks to [@Bronson Schoen](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/bronson-schoen?mention=user) for pushing back on an earlier, more rosy summary of this finding.
