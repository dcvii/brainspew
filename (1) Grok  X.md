Is it reasonable to make a political point about the distribution of wealth in the US as something entirely native to American attitudes, when in fact the USD is the reserve currency of the world. What are the GINI coefficients of China and authoritarian countries

No, it is not entirely reasonable to attribute the distribution of wealth in the US solely to "American attitudes" (such as cultural values, policy preferences, or societal norms), as this overlooks significant structural and global factors, including the USD's status as the world's reserve currency. This status grants the US unique privileges, such as seigniorage benefits (profiting from issuing currency used globally), the ability to borrow at low interest rates, and exporting inflation through trade deficits. These dynamics contribute to wealth concentration by amplifying financialization, asset bubbles, and capital inflows that disproportionately benefit the wealthy elite and corporations tied to global finance. While American attitudes and policies (e.g., tax structures, deregulation) play a role in perpetuating inequality, the reserve currency aspect introduces exogenous influences like global demand for USD assets, which inflate US wealth metrics beyond purely domestic factors. Inequality patterns in other countries, including authoritarian ones without reserve currency status, suggest that high wealth disparities can arise from diverse systemic causes, not just "attitudes." Regarding Gini coefficients, note that the Gini index measures inequality on a scale of 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (or 100, perfect inequality). Wealth Gini (distribution of net worth, including assets like stocks, real estate, and debts) typically shows higher inequality than income Gini (annual earnings distribution), as wealth accumulates over time and is more concentrated. The question specifies "wealth," so I prioritize wealth Gini data where available, but include income Gini for context, as it's more commonly reported and often used as a proxy in discussions of economic inequality. Data is drawn from reliable sources like the World Bank, Credit Suisse Global Wealth Databook (via Wikipedia compilation), and others; years reflect the latest available as of mid-2025.Income Gini Coefficients (Latest Available) These measure pre-tax income inequality. Authoritarian countries are selected based on common classifications (e.g., from Freedom House or similar indices, including regimes with limited political freedoms, one-party rule, or strong executive control).

| Country | Regime Type | Income Gini | Year | Notes/Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| United States | Democracy | 0.418 | 2023 |  |
| China |  | 0.474 | 2023 |  |
| Russia |  | 0.360 | 2021 |  |
| Saudi Arabia |  | ~0.450 | 2018 (est.) |  |
| Venezuela |  | 0.407 | 2017 |  |
| Iran |  | 0.362 | 2021 |  |
| Egypt | Authoritarian (military-backed) | 0.315 | 2019 |  |
| Turkey | Authoritarian-leaning (hybrid) | 0.328 | 2022 |  |
| Belarus | Authoritarian (dictatorship) | 0.248 | 2022 |  |
| Cuba |  | ~0.380 | 2019 (est.) |  |
| North Korea | Authoritarian (totalitarian) | N/A | N/A |  |

Wealth Gini Coefficients (Latest Available) These better align with "wealth distribution" and show higher concentration globally. Data is scarcer, especially for opaque regimes.

| Country | Wealth Gini | Year | Notes/Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| United States | 0.852 | 2021 |  |
| China | 0.701 | 2021 |  |
| Russia | 0.873 | 2021 |  |
| Saudi Arabia | 0.822 | 2021 |  |
| Iran | 0.792 | 2021 |  |
| Kazakhstan | 0.776 | 2021 |  |
| Uzbekistan | 0.794 | 2021 |  |
|  | N/A | N/A |  |

In summary, China's wealth Gini (0.701) is notably lower than the US (0.852), but many authoritarian countries like Russia (0.873) and Saudi Arabia (0.822) exceed the US, indicating that high wealth inequality is not unique to democratic or American systems. Factors like resource curses, corruption, and state capture often drive disparities in authoritarian regimes, paralleling how global reserve status influences the US.

The most widely accepted measures of social mobility in academic and policy contexts are intergenerational metrics, which assess how socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education, or occupation) is transmitted from parents to children. The primary standard is the intergenerational elasticity (IGE) of income, which quantifies the percentage change in a child's expected adult earnings associated with a 1% change in parental earnings—a lower IGE indicates higher mobility. Other common measures include rank-rank correlations (comparing percentile ranks of parents' and children's incomes), absolute upward mobility (the share of children earning more than their parents, adjusted for inflation), and transition matrices (probabilities of moving between income quintiles across generations). These are favored because they capture long-term societal equality of opportunity and are supported by longitudinal data from sources like tax records or surveys (e.g., via the OECD or Chetty et al.'s Opportunity Insights project). Intragenerational mobility—movement within one's own lifetime—is less standardized as a "social mobility" measure but is often evaluated through income volatility (year-to-year earnings fluctuations), persistence in income bands (average duration in a quintile), or intra-generational transition rates.Regarding your understanding of Americans spending less time in a given socioeconomic band, this aligns with evidence on intragenerational mobility: U.S. households do exhibit shorter average durations in income brackets compared to Europeans, driven by higher income volatility. This means Americans tend to experience more rapid upward and downward shifts—getting richer faster during booms or job changes but also poorer faster during setbacks—than their European counterparts. This pattern stems from the U.S.'s more flexible labor markets, lower unionization, and thinner social safety nets, which amplify economic dynamism but also instability. In contrast, Europe's stronger welfare systems (e.g., unemployment benefits, progressive taxation) and labor protections provide greater income stability, reducing volatility but potentially slowing upward mobility.Key Comparisons of Intragenerational Mobility (US vs. Europe) Data from studies using panel surveys (e.g., PSID for the US, EU-SILC for Europe) show the following trends, focusing on working-age adults over 5-10 year periods:

| Metric | United States |  | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  | 2-4 years | 4-6 years |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

For context, while intragenerational volatility enables faster wealth gains in the US (e.g., median real wages grew 1.5-2% annually in boom periods like the 2010s, outpacing Europe's 0.5-1%), it also leads to more frequent poverty spells—about 50% of Americans experience at least one year in the bottom quintile over a decade, vs. 30-40% in Europe. Recent data (post-2020) shows this gap persisting, though COVID-era policies temporarily reduced US volatility.
