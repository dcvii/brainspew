### Something has changed in the culture

Nike stock has been falling for almost four years. It never recovered from the pandemic—the company got sicker as people got healthier.

Not long ago, Nike was invulnerable. How could a company with more celebrity endorsements than any other consumer brand in the world ever lose it glamor?

But celebrity endorsements don’t help anymore. Maybe they even hurt.

The same is true of other companies linked to celebrities. Consider the case of Disney—which has also suffered a huge share price collapse during those same four years.

Take a look now at Warner Bros. Discovery, another celebrity-driven business.

Here’s the stock chart for AMC Entertainment during this same period—and it’s even uglier.

What happened to celebrities after 2021? Are they still under lockdown? Did the President slap a tariff on them? Did I miss the memo?

Let’s face it, it’s been a bad four years for superstars. And you can measure the collapse in many ways—from declining ratings for award shows to lackluster ticket sales for big budget films.

Even home prices in Hollywood are falling.

Is there a reason?

Many of you will tell me this is easy to explain—it’s another example of right-wing backlash. The MAGA crowd is Bud-Lighting Hollywood, just like they’re torching Washington, D.C.

But I don’t see this as a political issue—as I’ll explain below.

For a start, Democrats are actually more likely than Republicans to hold “negative opinions” about celebrity activism—55% admit to it. But the larger reality is that no demographic group in America has any deep love for Hollywood stars right now.

During the last four years, celebrities have been attacked on *all* sides—for

- Me-too violations
- Insensitive tweets
- Political activism
- Criminal charges of all sorts
- Out-of-touch lavish lifestyles
- Epstein client list rumors
- and all sorts of other real or supposed infractions

It’s revealing that the most watched Oscar moment in recent years involved a movie star jumping on stage and slapping another movie star. If you want to sum up the whole Hollywood malaise in a single moment, this is it.

Even movie stars hate movie stars.

The movies themselves don’t generate half as much interest. This year’s Oscar-winning Best Picture *Anora* only opened in 6 theaters on initial release, and never generated more than $2.5 million in its best week.

> ## “Brands now embrace micro-influencers, not Hollywood superstars. The meek really have inherited the earth.”

In recent months, Hollywood stars have been invisible in the most popular films—last year’s top ten were mostly animated features. And rest of the list was filled with monsters (Godzilla, King Kong, sandworms, etc.) or superheroes in masks or heavy makeup.

Not long ago, fans went to the movies to look at glamorous stars. Not anymore—in 2024, Sonic the Hedgehog was a bigger draw than Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks or Margot Robbie or Leonardo DiCaprio.

People go to the movies, but don’t want to see movie stars ( [Source](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/2024/) )

Robert DeNiro’s latest film is a [“box office disaster,”](https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/robert-de-niro-alto-knights-box-office-flop-1236345946/) according to *Variety*. Harrison Ford has now [exited three huge franchises with a dud](https://screenrant.com/indiana-jones-5-box-office-harrison-ford-star-wars-blade-runner/). Dwayne Johnson is sinking like a rock—he’s actually gone back to wrestling recently. And don’t even get me started on Johnny Depp.

And when audiences weren’t abandoning the stars, the stars were voluntarily walking away. [More than 40 celebrities](https://econotimes.com/Hollywood-Exodus-Stars-Threaten-to-Leave-US-After-Trump-Victory-Vowing-Dramatic-Farewells-if-He-Takes-Office-1693043) threatened to leave the US in the aftermath of the recent election—and [some have done just that](https://people.com/stars-who-left-the-us-moved-abroad-11700382).

But here’s the strange thing.

During those same four years, influencers and indie creators have gotten bigger and bigger. It almost seems as if these self-made personalities of the tiny screen stole the audience away from the Hollywood stars.

It’s been a great four years if you’re MrBeast or Alix Earle or Joe Rogan or Kai Cenat.

“Consumers trust relatable influencers over celebrities with curated lifestyles,” *[Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-micro-influencers-are-beating-celebrities-at-their-own/486675)* [magazine recently announced](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-micro-influencers-are-beating-celebrities-at-their-own/486675). A whole new language is evolving to describe these people—some call them [micro-influencers](https://www.esbo.ltd/how-genuine-micro-influencer-marketing-is-changing-the-psychology-of-persuasion/) or [niche influencers](https://blog.carusele.com/what-are-niche-influencers-and-why-brands-should-care).

Not long ago, they were just nobodies. Now they’re bigger than Hollywood.

How did that happen?

I said above, that the celebrity backlash is not about right-versus-left. It’s actually the result of down-versus-up.

I first warned about this [eleven long years ago](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-smartest-book-about-our-digital-age-was-published-in-1929/).

And [I shared an update in 2022](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/15-observations-on-the-emerging-vertical), when Hollywood was still naively optimistic about the end of the pandemic.

I wrote:

> The essence of down-versus-up is that a numerically large group of dissenters focus their anger on a small number of elites whom they view as antagonists, perhaps even evil villains.
> 
> These Down movements cut across left-versus-right political ideologies, and thus encompass seemingly incompatible groups such as Occupy Wall Street, the truck convoys, Black Lives Matter, the Tea Party, ANTIFA, cryptocurrency fanatics, and a host of other cohort groups in the news.
> 
> In every instance, these groups have proven capable of mobilizing intense energy among members—much greater energy than the Ups can ever hope to match. Participants seem to appear out of nowhere, leaping almost instantaneously into action.

I focused here on politics, but the same power shift is happening in movies, music, media, and every other sphere of culture.

And that’s why—contrary to all the conventional wisdom—brands now embrace micro-influencers, not Hollywood superstars. In an unexpected turnabout, the meek really have inherited the earth.

Did you have that on your bingo card?

All the energy and enthusiasm right now is coming from the Down side of the equation. It’s a true underground movement, and is now larger than the mainstream.

In 2025, YouTube is more powerful than Hollywood. TikTok is bigger than any TV network. Substackers and podcasters now shape the public discourse in ways that no mainstream outlet can match.

All the action is happening in the flyover states. MrBeast runs his influencer empire out of Greenville, North Carolina. Kai Cenat lives in Marietta Georgia. Alix Earle is in Florida. Joe Rogan (like me) moved from California to Austin, Texas—where there’s a veritable army of influencers in residence.

I know some of you are unhappy about this. Whenever I say the name MrBeast, I get angry responses. I’d have better luck selling you on the [Mark of the Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_\(Revelation\)).

But don’t blame me, I’m just the messenger.

I’m not here to serve up spin. I put that Honest Broker sign in front of my shop for a reason—I keep it real. I tell you what’s happening right now, and try to anticipate the future.

And the future will be driven by outsiders and their Down supporters. Their power is not diminishing—it’s getting stronger. The only way to have meaningful impact right now is by tapping into that energy.

Traditional celebrities don’t know how to operate in this brave new world. That’s why they look so confused.

And it won’t get better for them.

That’s because there are a half-dozen *other* trends that also threaten celebrities.

1. **Tech is making it easy to replace celebrities with AI equivalents** —and the entertainment industry is (perhaps foolishly) excited about the potential. The anticipated cost savings have stirred up their greed.
2. **Web platforms are deliberately creating a passive audience** —which lets the algorithm choose. This maximizes the technocracy’s power. In their ideal universe, Netflix and Spotify are bigger than the superstars themselves.
3. **The corporatization of culture has turned everything into interchangeable digital** ***content*** —spreading stagnation and blandness over the whole creative landscape. Celebrity glamor is negated by this process.
4. **The shift away from large screens (movie theaters) to small screens (smartphones) has robbed celebrities of their larger-than-life presence**. Nobody looks imposing when reduced to the small dimensions of a phone screen.
5. **Other tech trends—such as crowd-funding and blockchain and decentralized finance—are shifting wealth and power away from LA and NY** and into the hands of unruly outsiders. This further levels the playing field, and undermines legacy status markers.
6. **The dehumanization of creativity has led to other strange anti-celebrity trends—such as a preference for masked or anonymous creators.** This is everywhere—Banksy, Elena Ferrante, Daft Punk, *The Masked Singer,* etc. It’s almost as if the glut of digital images has created this reaction, giving the most allure to creative talent you never see.

In other words, the game is over for traditional celebrityhood. At best, it’s a depreciating asset. At worst, it’s a toxic commodity—which will eat up your budget and never pay it back.

In this environment, those expensive Nike endorsement contracts are huge liabilities. When you’re paying stars $1.5 billion to shill for you, they damn well better shine bright. In a world of falling stars, this spending spree must soon come to an end.

Hollywood is finally figuring this out—after four years in the desert.

Just look at how Hollywood now depicts itself. Not long ago, the studios tried to create their own legend. Just look at *La La Land* or *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* —where filmmakers cultivated an idealized image of their own craft.

But not anymore.

So it’s no coincidence that the same director who glorified the movie business in *La La Land*, turned around and slammed it in *Babylon*. Quentin Tarantino was planning to do the same in his next (and supposedly last) film, *The Movie Critic*. But he got so fed up with Hollywood that he decided to [write a stage play instead](https://awardsradar.com/2025/01/28/quentin-tarantino-is-writing-a-play-as-his-likely-next-project/).

He gets it. Others do too—at long last.

And that’s why the hottest thing in Hollywood this week is *The Studio* —a streaming series in which movie stars and filmmakers ruthlessly ridicule their own industry. All the hot celebrities are signing up for cameo appearances.

But what will those same celebrities do in a post-star culture?

This is an easy question to answer. The savvy celebrities will reinvent themselves as digital influencers. They will abandon their Up elitism, and pretend to possess Down gritty realness. They will hide their Hollywood connections and private jets, and ride the subway—or maybe even (horrors) eat at a Subway.

Many of them will launch podcasts and Substacks. (Some already have—but more are coming.)

You can see it happening in real time. The Duchess of Sussex is now doing a homemaking and cooking TV series—and never goes near Buckingham Palace. [Harrison Ford pretends that he drives a Jeep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70kJFIpfbAQ) and lives in a cabin ( [here’s his real home](https://www.echofineproperties.com/harrison-fords-california-home/) ). A friend of mine insists that he saw Mark Cuban at a bowling alley recently.

Forget the Met Gala. In 2025, you get more street cred by attending a NASCAR race or tossing darts in a smelly pub.

It’s gonna be tough for these celebrities—they all have to go slumming now. But I will shed no tears for them.

They had a nice run. And now it’s time for the next thing.

And that *next thing* will come from the Down underground.

So you are advised to listen to the rumblings from below. Those unruly outsiders will have much more impact than anything happening in a duchess’s kitchen or movie star’s log cabin.

Let me make one last prediction. Now that the meek have inherited the earth, they won’t be quite so meek anymore.

In stage one, the influencers got their influence. In stage two, they will start using it—for better or worse. And I don’t even want to imagine what stage three will look like.

But we will soon find out.
