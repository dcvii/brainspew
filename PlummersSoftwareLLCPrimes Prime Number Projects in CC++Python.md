## Primes | A Software Drag Race

**Note:** You're currently looking at the community contribution branch of this repo, which is now the default. The original branch can be found [here](https://github.com/plummerssoftwarellc/Primes/tree/original).

Source code to [Dave's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/c/DavesGarage/featured) video benchmarking the same prime number sieve in Python, C#, and C++.

## Build status

[![example workflow](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=drag-race)](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=drag-race)

## Community contributions

Community contributions, fixes and improvements are accepted on this branch. If you want to add your own solution, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes/blob/drag-race/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Running the benchmarks

The vast majority of benchmarks (solutions) in this repository can be built and run with one Makefile. This is described in [BENCHMARK.md](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes/blob/drag-race/BENCHMARK.md).

## Viewing results

The [PrimeView web application](https://plummerssoftwarellc.github.io/PrimeView/) can be used to view, filter and sort results generated by Dave's benchmark machine. It is our intention to add results of other systems in the future. **Note** that any feedback, suggestions, PRs concerning PrimeView need to be made on [the application's own repository](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/PrimeView).
