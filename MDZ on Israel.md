There's nothing here for me to disagree with...

A few observations on anti-Israel ferment in the West:

1. The manifest goal of Hamas and its global allies is nothing less than to literally destroy Israel. Not as a theory, but in practice. Accordingly, Hamas is playing a long game and is willing to make massive tactical sacrifices in order to further that aim, including subjecting Gazans to great suffering, understanding that the resulting propaganda narrative weakens Israel's image. October 7 was not a spontaneous event, it was the culmination of decades of belligerency and is just a foretaste of what Hamas (and compatriots) wish to repeat at a national scale with the sweep of years - if they are left with the means to do so.

2. Depriving Israel of Western support is a necessary predicate to its pined for destruction - particularly U.S. support. Everything we are seeing (both from the likes of the DSA on the left and the likes of Tucker on the right) now appears calculated, with that as the ultimate aim. The objective is to tar Israel as some kind of amalgamation of Apartheid South Africa and Nazi Germany - which, far from being worthy of support, should be pressured to the point of collapse. THIS is the game and millions and millions of people are being actively conditioned to believe that Israel is evil. If we had, say, a President AOC within a few years, would the U.S. be there to provide Israel with aid and support during an existential crisis? It's very doubtful. As noted in the excellent new book "While Israel Slept" - imagine if Biden had not provided munitions and deterred Hezbollah and Iran in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7. For all his weaknesses, Biden did the right thing at the most critical moment.

3. Antisemitism is an ever present virus and of course predates Israel's independence by millennia - but it also today strategically serves the aim of weakening Israel and it's clearly being churned up with that objective. If Jews are responsible for all social ills (be it capitalist excess, illegal immigration, pedophilia, you name it), all the more reason to disregard and indeed spurn the polity of the Jews, as well as diaspora advocacy for defending Israel as a bastion of the West and, in particular, calls for preserving the U.S.-Israel special relationship with all its mutual (yes, mutual) benefits.

4. Anti-Israel activities absolutely reflect an erosion of Western values. A small democracy is waging a just defensive war against a literal terror army with eliminationist aims, and it is the democracy that is reviled among Western youth and "liberal" elites. Indeed, of all the "causes" on earth, this is the one that has coalesced into a transnational mass movement, replete with its own religious like doctrine, iconography, and catechisms. All of this is less a reflection of Israel's behavior than a mirror evidencing a very deep societal malaise, indeed, a kind of self-hatred. This explains how not 25 years after 9/11, an Israel hating socialist would be the leading mayoral candidate in a metropolis that is the global center of capitalism and the jewel of the crown of the Jewish diaspora.
