Before Donald Trump’s decisive election victory last week, Reddit witches on r/WitchesVsPatriarchy were trading notes on what spells to cast to prevent him from getting re-elected.

Some members were advising against it, claiming he has a form of protection surrounding him:

My guess is that warlocks are not casting protection spells for Trump; rather, something else is happening:

Prayer versus magick[1](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/prayer-trumps-magick?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=34046&post_id=151554639&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-1-151554639)—the raging skeptics will dismiss this claim as “woo,” while meta-intellectuals may see it as a useful metaphor, but those with traditional or post-skeptical views will believe it is real. In any case, whether your metaphysics allow openness to such a claim, there are people out there who do believe this perspective. Their numbers are increasing, and these believers are using their spiritual practice of choice to promote their political candidate of choice.

Perspectives shape reality, and the view that the culture war is a spiritual war is now the dominant one, or will be very soon, with the Culture War Left employing **woke occultism** and **[snot](https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/on-millennial-snot) scientism**[2](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/prayer-trumps-magick?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=34046&post_id=151554639&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-2-151554639), while the Culture War Right relies on **based Christianity** and **edgelord vitalism**[3](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/prayer-trumps-magick?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=34046&post_id=151554639&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-3-151554639). Within each culture war pole, there are fundamental tensions—witches and skeptics don’t always get along, nor do Christians and Nietzscheans—but for now, they have a common enemy in the opposing pole.

This claim echoes one made by druid John Michael Greer after Trump was first elected: magick, understood as the art of causing changes in reality in accordance with will, would become a prominent and explicit feature in politics. In documenting the “Kek Wars”[4](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/prayer-trumps-magick?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=34046&post_id=151554639&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-4-151554639) of 2016, where memes became sigils, Greer observed how Pepe the Frog and chaos magick merged in support of Trump’s election. This meme magick from the Culture War Right sparked the [#MagicResistance](https://www.vox.com/2017/6/20/15830312/magicresistance-restance-witches-magic-spell-to-bind-donald-trump-mememagic) backlash from the Culture War Left, with Wiccans casting spells against Trump and his administration.

As an illustration, a coven of New York witches attempted to place a hex on Brett Kavanaugh after his appointment to the Supreme Court, which was countered by a San Jose exorcist, Father Gary Thomas, who held a Mass to protect Kavanaugh on the day the hex was taking place[5](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/prayer-trumps-magick?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=34046&post_id=151554639&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-5-151554639). If Trump was accidentally meme’d into office through magick in 2016, as Greer claims, prayer now seems to be the spiritual practice increasingly used by the Culture War Right leading up to his reelection[6](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/prayer-trumps-magick?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=34046&post_id=151554639&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-6-151554639).

Jordan Peterson and Russell Brand recently leading a crowd of 25,000 in the [Lord’s Prayer](https://x.com/LibertyLockPod/status/1840494160039620970).

**Magick is defined as aligning reality to one’s will, and prayer as aligning one’s will to God**. Trump’s victory was undeniably historic, and after surviving years of cancellation, lawfare, and literally dodging a bullet, many of his supporters who believe in God—and who see themselves in dialogue with Him through prayer—believe their prayers were answered, and something has lifted, as if a spell was broken.

Prayer may have trumped magick for this election, but the spiritual war has not ended; it has simply become conscious again.
