## On the case of the State of Illinois to the lastest SCOTUS decision that references NAGR v Naperville and Harrel v Raoul, etc



Background

- Harrel v. Raoul: This case, consolidated with others like Barnett v. Raoul, challenges Illinois’ statewide ban on “assault weapons” and large-capacity magazines under the Second Amendment. Plaintiffs, including the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC), Second Amendment Foundation (SAF), and Illinois State Rifle Association (ISRA), argue the bans violate the right to keep and bear arms, citing District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and NYSRPA v. Bruen (2022). On November 8, 2024, Southern District of Illinois Judge Stephen McGlynn ruled PICA unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction, but stayed it for 30 days to allow an appeal. The Seventh Circuit granted a stay, keeping the ban in place pending appeal.
- NAGR v. Naperville: This case challenges both Naperville’s ordinance and Illinois’ PICA, arguing they unconstitutionally restrict commonly used firearms. The National Association for Gun Rights (NAGR) sought preliminary injunctions, which were denied by the Northern District of Illinois and the Seventh Circuit. The Seventh Circuit, in Bevis v. Naperville (2023), concluded that the banned firearms (e.g., AR-15s) may not be protected by the Second Amendment, classifying them as “militaristic.”

SCOTUS Involvement

- Petitions for Certiorari: Multiple petitions were filed with SCOTUS, including Harrel v. Raoul (No. 23-877), Barnett v. Raoul (No. 23-879), NAGR v. Naperville (No. 23-880), and others, distributed for the May 16, 2024, conference. These petitions ask whether the Constitution permits bans on semiautomatic firearms and magazines “in common use” for lawful purposes and whether Illinois’ bans should be enjoined.
- SCOTUS Actions:
	- In December 2023, SCOTUS denied NAGR’s request for an injunction pending appeal in Bevis v. Naperville, leaving the bans in place. Justice Amy Coney Barrett had earlier requested a response from Naperville, indicating interest but not resulting in immediate relief.

Current Status

- No SCOTUS decision has been issued on the merits of NAGR v. Naperville or Harrel v. Raoul. The cases are still in the appellate process, with the Seventh Circuit reviewing the district court’s rulings. The permanent injunction in Harrel is stayed, so Illinois’ and Naperville’s bans remain enforceable.
- The Supreme Court may take up these cases if the Seventh Circuit issues a final judgment, especially given the circuit split potential with cases like Bianchi v. Brown (Maryland’s assault weapons ban).
- The legal debate hinges on Bruen ’s text-and-history test, with plaintiffs arguing that semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15 are “in common use” for self-defense, while Illinois and Naperville claim they are “militaristic” and outside Second Amendment protection.

Notes

- The issue is politically charged, with posts on X reflecting strong pro-Second Amendment sentiment and frustration with the Seventh Circuit’s rulings.

**What are the faults with the Bevis analysis, and what is the 7th's injuction as regards 'assault weapons'?**

1. Misapplication of Bruen and Heller:
	- The Supreme Court’s NYSRPA v. Bruen (2022) and District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) established that the Second Amendment protects arms “in common use” for lawful purposes, such as self-defense, and that regulations must be consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Critics argue that Bevis deviates from this framework by creating a “militaristic” versus “non-militaristic” distinction not grounded in Supreme Court precedent. Justice Thomas, in his statement on the denial of certiorari in Bevis (July 2024), called this distinction “unmoored from both text and history” and “nonsensical,” arguing that it improperly excludes commonly owned firearms like AR-15s from Second Amendment protection.
	- The Bevis court’s reliance on a military-civilian divide ignores Heller ’s clarification that the Second Amendment’s prefatory clause (“A well regulated Militia”) does not limit the operative clause’s protection of individual rights. The DOJ’s June 2025 brief in Harrel v. Raoul emphasized that even United States v. Miller (1939) protects arms suitable for militia use, which AR-15s arguably are, contradicting Bevis ’s exclusion of “militaristic” firearms.
2. Erroneous “Militaristic” Test:
	- The DOJ argued that Bevis ’s test conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, which does not require plaintiffs to prove a weapon is “non-militaristic” but rather places the burden on the government to justify restrictions with historical analogues. The Bevis analysis, by contrast, shifts this burden to plaintiffs, requiring them to prove a weapon falls within Second Amendment protection.
3. Ignoring Common Use and Factual Evidence:
	- The Bevis majority also failed to engage with historical evidence that semiautomatic firearms have civilian analogues dating back to the 19th century, such as repeating rifles, which were used for self-defense and not deemed “unusual.” The DOJ noted that Bevis overlooks this history, focusing instead on modern machine gun regulations (e.g., the 1930s Thompson submachine gun bans) that are not analogous to semiautomatic rifles.
4. Inconsistent Application of Precedent:
	- The Bevis panel’s 2-1 decision (Judges Wood and Easterbrook in the majority, Judge Brennan dissenting) has been criticized for selectively applying precedent. For example, the majority relied on Friedman v. City of Highland Park (2015), a pre- Bruen case upholding an assault weapons ban, despite Bruen ’s rejection of the interest-balancing approach used in Friedman. Critics, including Judge Brennan’s dissent, argue that Bevis clings to outdated reasoning that Bruen overruled.
	- The decision also conflicts with other circuits’ interpretations. For instance, the Fourth Circuit’s upholding of Maryland’s assault weapons ban in Bianchi v. Brown (August 2024) used a different rationale, creating a potential circuit split that critics say Bevis exacerbates by misreading Bruen.
5. Procedural and Evidentiary Shortcomings:
1. Bevis v. Naperville (November 2023):
	- In Bevis, the Seventh Circuit (2-1) vacated a preliminary injunction issued by Judge Stephen McGlynn in April 2023 that had blocked enforcement of PICA and Naperville’s ordinance. The court ruled that the state and city were likely to prevail, as the banned firearms were “militaristic” and not protected by the Second Amendment. This allowed both bans to remain in effect pending further litigation.
	- The Supreme Court declined to issue an injunction pending appeal in May 2023 and again in December 2023, leaving the bans enforceable.
2. - On November 8, 2024, Judge McGlynn issued a permanent injunction in Harrel v. Raoul, declaring PICA unconstitutional after a September 2024 bench trial. He stayed the injunction for 30 days to allow Illinois to appeal.
	- On December 5, 2024, a Seventh Circuit panel (Judges Easterbrook, Brennan, and St. Eve) granted Illinois’ motion to stay McGlynn’s permanent injunction, keeping PICA in effect pending the appeal’s resolution. The panel noted that their prior Bevis ruling (denying a preliminary injunction) supported maintaining the status quo, as “the laws have enough support to remain in place pending the final resolution of plaintiffs’ suit.” They also criticized McGlynn for procedural noncompliance in his injunction order.
	- The Seventh Circuit’s order emphasized that PICA cannot be valid in some parts of Illinois and invalid in others, justifying the stay to preserve statewide consistency. The court has not yet ruled on the merits of PICA’s constitutionality, and oral arguments or a final decision are pending.
3. Current Status:
	- As of June 27, 2025, the Seventh Circuit has not lifted the stay on McGlynn’s permanent injunction from Harrel v. Raoul. Therefore, PICA and Naperville’s assault weapons bans remain enforceable across Illinois.
	- A separate challenge to Cook County’s assault weapons ban (Viramontes v. Cook County) was argued before the Seventh Circuit on November 12, 2024, but no decision has been issued. This case also tests Bevis ’s framework.

Summary

- Faults with Bevis: The Bevis analysis is criticized for misapplying Bruen and Heller, creating an unsupported “militaristic” test, ignoring the common use of AR-15s, relying on outdated precedent, and mishandling evidentiary burdens. These critiques are echoed by Judge McGlynn, the DOJ, Justice Thomas, and gun rights groups, who argue it undermines Second Amendment protections.
- Seventh Circuit Injunction: The Seventh Circuit has consistently declined to enjoin PICA or Naperville’s bans. It vacated a preliminary injunction in Bevis (2023) and stayed a permanent injunction in Harrel (December 2024), keeping the assault weapons bans in effect pending appeal. No final merits decision has been issued.

Next Steps

The Seventh Circuit’s upcoming rulings in Harrel, Barnett, and NAGR v. Naperville will determine whether PICA is upheld or struck down. If the bans are upheld, the Supreme Court is likely to grant certiorari, given Justice Thomas’s signaled interest and the potential circuit split with cases like Bianchi v. Brown.

**In which way has it been argued that PICA could be unconstitutional?**

- Argument: PICA bans firearms and magazines “in common use” for lawful purposes, which violates the Second Amendment as interpreted by District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and NYSRPA v. Bruen (2022). Heller held that the Second Amendment protects arms commonly used by law-abiding citizens for self-defense, and Bruen clarified that such arms are presumptively protected unless the government proves a restriction is consistent with historical tradition.
- Details:
	- Large-Capacity Magazines: PICA’s ban on magazines holding more than 10 rounds for rifles and 15 for handguns is challenged as restricting accessories integral to protected firearms. McGlynn’s ruling noted that magazines with capacities of 17-30 rounds are standard for many commonly owned handguns and rifles, making them protected under the Second Amendment.
	- Criticism of Bevis: The Seventh Circuit’s Bevis v. Naperville (2023) decision, which upheld PICA by classifying banned firearms as “militaristic,” is argued to misapply Bruen by ignoring common use and imposing an unsupported military-civilian distinction. The Department of Justice’s June 2025 brief in Harrel supported this view, arguing that Bevis conflicts with Heller ’s focus on civilian use.
- Argument: PICA lacks a historical analogue in the nation’s tradition of firearm regulation, as required by Bruen. The government must demonstrate that the ban is consistent with regulations from the Founding or Reconstruction eras, but plaintiffs argue no such tradition exists.
- Details:
	- Lack of Historical Bans: In Harrel v. Raoul, McGlynn found that Illinois failed to provide evidence of 18th- or 19th-century laws banning entire classes of commonly owned firearms or magazines. Historical regulations cited by the state, such as 1930s machine gun bans, were deemed non-analogous because they targeted fully automatic weapons, unlike PICA’s semiautomatic firearms.
	- Burden on the State: Bruen places the burden on the government to justify restrictions, but plaintiffs argue that Illinois relies on modern policy arguments (e.g., public safety) rather than historical evidence. The DOJ’s brief criticized the Seventh Circuit for not requiring Illinois to meet this burden, instead shifting it to plaintiffs to prove the arms are protected.
	- Civilian Militia Use: Some plaintiffs, citing United States v. Miller (1939), argue that AR-15s are suitable for militia use, a purpose explicitly protected by the Second Amendment’s prefatory clause. This undermines PICA’s claim that such firearms are exclusively “militaristic.”
- Due Process (Vagueness):
	- Argument: PICA’s definitions of “assault weapons” and banned accessories are unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The statute’s language, which lists specific models and features (e.g., pistol grips, adjustable stocks), is argued to be unclear, leaving gun owners uncertain about what is prohibited.
	- Details: In Harrel v. Raoul, plaintiffs argued that PICA’s complex criteria for banned firearms and attachments fail to provide fair notice, risking arbitrary enforcement. For example, the ban on “copies or duplicates” of listed firearms is seen as ambiguous, potentially encompassing a wide range of semiautomatic rifles. McGlynn’s ruling noted testimony from Illinois State Police officials admitting confusion over enforcement standards.
- Equal Protection:
	- Argument: PICA’s exemptions for certain groups (e.g., law enforcement, military personnel) violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by treating similarly situated individuals differently without a rational basis.
- Argument: PICA is overly broad, banning an entire class of firearms and magazines that are disproportionately used for lawful self-defense, thus infringing on the core Second Amendment right.
- Details:
	- Trial evidence in Harrel showed that AR-15s and high-capacity magazines are often chosen for home defense due to their reliability, accuracy, and capacity, which are critical in high-stress situations. Banning these tools, plaintiffs argue, unduly restricts the right to self-defense recognized in Heller.
	- The ban’s scope—covering numerous firearm models and standard magazines—sweeps too broadly, capturing arms that are not “dangerous and unusual” under Heller. McGlynn’s ruling emphasized that PICA’s “blanket prohibition” fails to account for the lawful uses of these firearms.
- Argument: PICA may conflict with federal law or be preempted by statutes like the National Firearms Act (NFA) or the Gun Control Act, which regulate but do not ban the firearms and magazines covered by PICA.
- Details: Some plaintiffs argue that PICA’s outright bans exceed federal regulations, which allow possession of semiautomatic rifles and standard magazines with proper licensing or compliance. This claim is less prominent but appears in briefs, such as those filed by the Illinois State Rifle Association, asserting that state bans cannot override federal frameworks for lawful firearm ownership.

Supporting Context

- Judicial Support: Judge McGlynn’s November 2024 ruling in Harrel v. Raoul declared PICA unconstitutional, finding that the banned firearms and magazines are protected under Heller and that Illinois failed to meet Bruen ’s historical test. He issued a permanent injunction (stayed by the Seventh Circuit in December 2024), reinforcing these arguments.
- DOJ Position: The DOJ’s June 2025 brief in Harrel supported plaintiffs, arguing that Bevis ’s “militaristic” test misapplies Bruen and that PICA’s bans lack historical grounding, bolstering the unconstitutionality claim.
- Supreme Court Interest: Justice Thomas’s July 2024 statement in Bevis (denying certiorari) signaled skepticism of the Seventh Circuit’s reasoning, suggesting that PICA’s constitutionality is ripe for SCOTUS review if the Seventh Circuit upholds the bans.
- Public and Legal Sentiment: Posts on X and amicus briefs from gun rights groups (e.g., NAGR, SAF) emphasize that PICA infringes on fundamental rights, citing the widespread ownership of AR-15s and the lack of historical bans on similar arms.
