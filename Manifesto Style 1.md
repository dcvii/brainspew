A manifesto is a public declaration of intentions, motives, or views, often political in nature, but also can be artistic or philosophical. Its writing style is characterized by several distinctive features:

1. **Direct and Commanding Tone**: Manifestos are often written with a strong, authoritative voice. They are intended to inspire, mobilize, or persuade others, thus employing a tone that is both confident and commanding.

2. **Clear and Concise Language**: The language used is typically straightforward and aimed at being understandable to a wide audience. Manifestos avoid unnecessary jargon or complexity, making their points clearly and directly.

3. **Emphatic and Persuasive**: They are designed to be persuasive documents, often using rhetorical devices such as repetition, parallelism, and emotional appeals to make the argument more compelling.

4. **Ideological and Visionary**: Manifestos usually express a clear ideology or vision, outlining a critique of the current state of affairs and proposing a future direction or solution. They are often idealistic, aiming to stir readers towards a new or refined way of thinking.

5. **Structured and Organized**: While the length and structure can vary, manifestos typically follow a logical organization, starting with a declaration of principles or grievances, followed by a discussion of objectives or theories, and concluding with a call to action.

6. **Urgent and Proactive**: The language often conveys a sense of urgency and calls for immediate action. Manifestos are not passive documents; they seek to provoke change or action.

Manifestos can vary widely depending on their context (political, artistic, technological, etc.), but these features are commonly found across different types of manifestos. They are meant to be impactful, inspiring readers to think differently, act, or join a cause.
