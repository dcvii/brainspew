### In this week's Europe Dispatch, Minna Ålander reflects on Europe's Russia problem.

Hello Everyone,

This week I wrote some more personal musings about how it feels to be a European millennial. We had a good run for a while: overcoming the Cold War division of Europe, the EU’s big bang enlargement, the early 2000’s tech boom (it was particularly good for us Finns, with Nokia), and an overall sense that things were continuously getting better. Until they started getting worse: first with the 2008 financial crash, then Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine, rise of populism in the wake of the migration crisis, the pandemic, and now an all-out war on our continent. Never to forget the increasingly tangible effects of the climate change, the Trump-induced collapse of the global trade regime, and the creeping breakdown of the rules-based international order. Oh and likely nuclear proliferation in the future.

Apropos nuclear proliferation, if you want to read something more upbeat, I wrote for the [European Correspondent](https://europeancorrespondent.com/en/r/are-you-ready-for-nordic-nukes) about the internet-joke-turned-semi-serious-debate on the revival of the 15 <sup>th</sup> century Kalmar Union that united all Nordic countries in one kingdom. But now with a nuclear twist.

Yours,

Minna

**War In Our Time**

My generation of Europeans, born towards the end or right after the Cold War, had it good for a couple decades. We grew up in a Europe where Russia was largely irrelevant and the whole continent was becoming accessible in completely new ways, thanks to the free mobility granted by the [Schengen system](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/schengen-area/). The cheap flight era enabled spontaneous trips to all kinds of European cities on short notice. Granted, job security has always been a thing of the past and the climate change was always looming in the background. But war? It seemed like a very far-away phenomenon – Europe had made a supreme effort after World War II to overcome war among European nations, after all.

The needle to the European bubble was Russia. After the Cold War, Russia could never accept the core idea of European integration: that natural differences in territory, population size and economic power are compensated for in the design of the EU to give small members a stronger voice, and to force larger members to consider smaller states’ interests. For Russia, and Vladimir Putin personally, it remained unthinkable to treat little countries like its Baltic neighbours as equals.

I am not a Russia expert by any means but my pet theory of Russian superiority complex is that Putin simply couldn’t stand the idea that a whole generation of Finns and other people of (in the Russian view) inferior nationalities grew up, never thinking about Russia, knowing nothing about Russia, and disinterested in Russia. By choosing violence, Putin forced people like me to think about Russia. I am often deeply annoyed about it because fundamentally, Russia still does not interest me particularly. There are so many other fascinating countries in Eastern Europe I’ve always been much more interested in, such as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus, as well as Moldova and Ukraine.

Given its superiority complex toward most of Europe, and persistent delusions of grandeur, Putin has been obsessing over the US as a more suitable rival – nevermind that Russia is far from on par with the US. At the same time, it has been much more convenient for Russia to have a weak Europe as a neighbour, dependent on the US and with a question mark hovering over US commitment to Europe. Although it is good for Russia’s goals in its war against Ukraine to cut off the US from aiding Ukraine and to drive a wedge between Europe and the US, in the long run it’s worse from a Russian point of view if Europe actually becomes capable to operate independently from the US. It has already been a nasty surprise that Trump has not been as good an agent as Putin has hoped for, not being able to coerce Ukraine or Europe into accepting Russian terms for a ceasefire or peace. In the long run, a Europe that can easily overmatch Russian military capability and industrial output will be a big headache for the Kremlin that chose to make Europe its enemy.

And what enemies Russia has made along the way! I wrote [last week](https://phillipspobrien.substack.com/p/a-tripp-to-the-south-caucasus) that Russia is always its own worst advocacy, and this habit has been particularly impressively at display with France. Macron has gone from talking about off-ramps and [not humiliating Russia](https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-putin-ukraine-invasion-mistake/) to calling Putin “ [a predator, and an ogre at our doorstep](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/world/europe/macron-putin-predator-russia-ukraine-war.html) ”.

Now, my generation of Europeans are facing war in our time, on our continent. Many are aware that the war can one day reach them personally. I, for one, am happy if we can push it back as many years as possible, for time is precious for Europe as it is building up its military capability. If (and that’s a big if) we can avoid a war altogether, Europe will be fine when all is said and done. The US probably not so much, after the havoc Trump’s second term has already wreaked - and it’s only been 7 months.
