Four years ago, I explained to *Quillette* readers why I am “ [Against Land Acknowledgements](https://quillette.com/2022/01/12/against-land-acknowledgements/).” As most will know, these are sombre declarations testifying to the historical existence of Indigenous tribes that were once situated in this or that geographical region (and, in some cases, that may still have an ongoing demographic presence). Such statements have become fashionable in North America and Australasia, particularly among progressive-minded academics and [local politicians](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15477199/toronto-canada-lawmaker-land-acknowledgement-city-council-meeting.html?ref=quillette.com).

At the University of Washington (UW), where I teach computer programming, we have a [standardised version](https://www.washington.edu/omad/about-omad/?ref=quillette.com) that runs as follows: “The University of Washington acknowledges the Coast Salish peoples of this land, the land which touches the shared waters of all tribes and bands within the Suquamish, Tulalip, and Muckleshoot nations.”

According to explanatory text on the university’s web site, it took “several years” to craft this 31-word land acknowledgement—as input (apparently) had to be solicited from “tribal elders, elected tribal leaders, attendees of the annual UW Tribal Leadership Summit, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, UW Native American Advisory Board and others across our community.”

The Office of Minority Affairs and Diversity notes that this model land acknowledgement should be “spoken by UW leadership”—which is to say, senior administrators—“during events to acknowledge that our campus sits on occupied land.”

But in 2019, things went further. The Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at UW, where I work, revised its *Best Practices for Inclusive Teaching* to recommend that all instructors add an Indigenous land acknowledgement to their course syllabi. The above-cited standardised UW land acknowledgement (which had been adopted four years earlier) was offered as an example to be followed. This was not a formal “prescription,” we were assured, but just an “idea” that would help us be “more effective teacher\[s\] and better role model\[s\].”

As I saw it—and still see it—land acknowledgments are a form of political speech, aimed (at least implicitly) at advancing the idea that a debt of some kind is owed to Indigenous groups. The word “occupied,” in particular, suggests that the presence of UW, its staff, and its students in this part of the world is morally illegitimate.

> People are free to hold pro-Indigenous political views. But expressing them with ‘inclusive’ spoken-word rituals doesn’t change their political character—even if the claimed goal is to improve pedagogical ‘effectiveness.’

The use of such language also suggests that we all have some (ill-defined) duty to restore the land to (by the university’s description) “the original caretakers”; or at least channel the beliefs of Indigenous constituencies in making day-to-day land-use decisions.

People are, of course, free to hold such political views. But embedding them in “inclusive” spoken-word rituals doesn’t erase their political character—notwithstanding the disingenuous conceit that the objective is merely to improve our pedagogical “effectiveness.”

Like [others](https://x.com/integrity_to/status/2014010967084982784?s=20&ref=quillette.com), I decided to strike a blow against such policies through satire—specifically, by including a parody version of a land acknowledgement on my course syllabus in January 2022. Instead of using the university’s version, I wrote:

> *I acknowledge that by the labor theory of property, the Coast Salish people can claim historical ownership of almost none of the land currently occupied by the University of Washington.*

The “labor theory of property” originates with seventeenth-century English philosopher John Locke. In *Two Treatises of Government*, he argues that when one’s labour is mixed with shared land, the land loses its public character, because people own the products of their work. Or as Locke originally [put it](https://books.google.ca/books?id=7kwUAAAAQAAJ&ref=quillette.com): “Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property.”

For example, the land on which downtown Seattle sits was once an Indigenous village—which gives the tribes in question a claim of ownership according to this theory. But UW’s main campus was carved out of dense forest, and therefore would not qualify.

My land acknowledgement quickly became a hot topic within UW’s reddit community, with many social-justice-minded students expressing outrage. UW officials pronounced themselves “horrified,” censored my syllabus, and offered my students an alternate course section if they wanted a different instructor. The university then began an investigation, which could have led to the termination of my employment.

With the support of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), I filed a lawsuit in July 2022, arguing that these actions constituted a violation of my First Amendment rights. I also argued that the university was engaged in retaliation and viewpoint discrimination; that I was owed monetary compensation for the harm done to me; and that the university’s “Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action” policy, known as Executive Order 31, was facially over-broad and unconstitutionally vague. (EO-31, which purported to “promot\[e\] an environment that is free of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation,” stipulated that UW could discipline “any conduct that is deemed unacceptable or inappropriate, regardless of whether the conduct rises to the level of *unlawful* discrimination, harassment, or retaliation” (my emphasis).

We lost at the district-court level. But in a split decision filed on 19 December, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [reversed](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/12/19/24-3518.pdf?ref=quillette.com) the lower-court judgment. Circuit Judge Daniel Aaron Bress wrote:

> A public university investigated, reprimanded, and threatened to discipline a professor for contentious statements he made in a class syllabus. The statements, which mocked the university’s model syllabus statement on an issue of public concern, caused offense in the university community. Yet debate and disagreement are hallmarks of higher education. Student discomfort with a professor’s views can prompt discussion and disapproval. But this discomfort is not grounds for the university retaliating against the professor. We hold that the university’s actions toward the professor violated his First Amendment rights. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.

Many people have asked me how I feel now that I’ve been vindicated. The obvious answer is that I am quite pleased. And I recommend that anyone interested in the issues I’ve raised read the [entire decision](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/12/19/24-3518.pdf?ref=quillette.com) (or the shorter [summary](https://www.stuartreges.com/case/facts.shtml?ref=quillette.com) of the case that I’ve [posted](https://www.stuartreges.com/case/facts.shtml?ref=quillette.com) online, along with an [excerpt](https://www.stuartreges.com/case/defense.shtml?ref=quillette.com) from the judgment). Of particular note, Judge Bress (who was joined by Judge Milan D. Smith) noted that

> *The public university occupies a central place in the law of the First Amendment… When we place limits on what professors may say or impose punishment for the views they express, we destock the marketplace of ideas and imperil future generations who must be exposed to a range of ideas and readied for the disharmony of a democratic society… if student anxiety or outrage toward a professor’s academic speech could justify restricting what a professor says, then universities would cease to occupy any ‘special niche’ in our First Amendment traditions.*

“The dissent would seemingly grant college students the power to restrict their professors’ academic speech in the name of avoiding distress,” he added. If such a principle were invoked, it would be “a surefire way to silence unpopular or controversial speech that the First Amendment robustly protects.”

Likewise, “the dissent’s focus on student ‘distress’ fails for the same reason, as it would allow students’ emotional reactions to academic speech to ‘cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.’”

Those last eight words, it should be said, are quoted from a 1967 case called [*Keyishian v. Board of Regents*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/385/589/?ref=quillette.com), in which the US Supreme Court found that it was unconstitutional for the State University of New York to demand that faculty formally renounce the precepts of communism.

In his decision, Judge Bress mentioned my penchant for taking controversial stands, and specifically cited my 2018 *Quillette* article, [*Why Women Don’t Code*](https://quillette.com/2018/06/19/why-women-dont-code/). That article generated so much heat that it now has its own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Women_Don%27t_Code?ref=quillette.com) (much like my [court case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reges_v._Cauce?ref=quillette.com)), in part because several academics assign it as reading in their courses.

In that article, I note that we’ve made significant progress in increasing the percentage of women pursuing degrees in computer science and careers in software engineering. But I also argue that we’ve probably reached a natural plateau. Going forward, men will continue to outnumber women in these programs to some extent, not because of societal prejudice or conditioning (the ideologically preferred explanation), but because men and women, taken as groups, tend to have different academic interests. I quote from an *Atlantic* [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/the-more-gender-equality-the-fewer-women-in-stem/553592/?ref=quillette.com) by Olga Khazan: “It could just be that, feeling financially secure and on equal footing with men, some women will always choose to follow their passions, rather than whatever labor economists recommend. And those passions don’t always lie within science.”

I’ve been vilified for writing that article—which I wouldn’t mind if the hate were based on what I actually argue. But I regularly run into students and others who say, “Aren’t you the guy who said that women *can’t code*?”—despite the fact that I’ve never claimed, in *Quillette* or anywhere else, that women have less programming ability than men. (At oral arguments, the dissenting appellate judge, Sidney R. Thomas, [signal-boosted this error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI4aaynXYVc&t=2700s&ref=quillette.com) when he [asked](https://www.courtlistener.com/audio/99070/reges-v-cauce-et-al/?ref=quillette.com) my lawyer, “Do you think if he had put on ‘women can’t code’ as part of his syllabus, that would have been disruptive?”)

> I would have enjoyed exploring issues such as ownership claims on land, and the performative nature of land acknowledgements. But I had no takers. Instead, the incident was instantly politicised.

When my land acknowledgement suddenly garnered significant attention, I was similarly disappointed that nobody wanted to discuss the actual substance of the issue. I would have enjoyed exploring issues such as ownership claims on land, and the performative nature of land acknowledgements. But I had no takers. Instead, the incident was instantly politicised.

The director of the Allen School [wrote](https://mynorthwest.com/jason-rantz/rantz-uw-admin-war-seattle-professors-land-joke/3301858?ref=quillette.com) that “the invocation of Locke’s labor theory of property dehumanizes and demeans Indigenous people, and is contrary to the long-standing relationship and respect the UW has with and for the Coast Salish peoples and the federally recognized tribes within the state of Washington.” A few days later, the student senate passed an emergency [resolution](https://www.dailyuw.com/news/governance/asuw-votes-to-call-for-increased-diversity-in-cse-department-and-beyond/article_daa2d2bc-74f9-11ec-bf9c-dfd0c0bfd41c.html?ref=quillette.com) that called on the university to “commit to a 3% annual increase in the student population of Alaska Native/Native American students, leading to an Alaska Native/Native American student population of at least 24% by 2030.” A group of native faculty and staff [wrote](https://www.stuartreges.com/case/native.shtml?ref=quillette.com) that drawing on John Locke is “directly extolling the concepts of manifest destiny and slavery, which have long been used to support white supremacy,” and that my “commitment to the rhetoric of settler colonialism is not conducive to learning.”

I anticipated that I’d be criticised for satirising a performative practice that now functions, in many progressive milieus, as a form of secular prayer (and while invoking a philosopher who heavily influenced the Declaration of Independence, no less). Satire, like all forms of humour, is anathema to religious and ersatz religious movements, since it is (correctly) feared as an ideologically subversive force. After all, if even a single person is permitted to laugh at a sacred dogma without punishment, what’s to stop everyone else from following suit?

But I was optimistic that things would be different once the legal system got involved. Jurists focus on facts; as opposed to the improbable rumours that had been circulated on campus in a bid to vilify me.

It had been claimed, for instance, that an Indigenous student in my program had taken a leave of absence because of me—and that a second had dropped out entirely. In his judgment, Judge Bress wrote that, “the first student—who was not a student in Reges’s class—described other factors influencing the decision to take a leave of absence… As for the second student, it appears undisputed that this student does not exist.” Notwithstanding the fact that I had to take this case to appeal, it’s gratifying to see the truth finally come out.

So how *do* I feel about this outcome? Grateful but also somewhat numb, almost like I was reading about something that happened to someone else. From the time I first approached FIRE in early 2022, this process has dragged on for four years. And the psychic strain has taken its toll.

During this period, I have continued to be employed at UW, and am currently in the second year of a three-year teaching contract. While the university’s leaders have never publicly apologised to me, I’m guessing that, by now, it must have occurred to them that they overreacted to my act of satire. Last summer, they quietly rescinded the policy they’d weaponised against me (the aforementioned [Executive Order 31](https://policy.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EO31-%E2%80%93-Nondiscrimination-and-Affirmative-Action-%E2%80%93-rescinded-07-23-25.pdf?ref=quillette.com)). As noted above, we’d argued that the policy was overly broad. So I count this move as a victory, even though UW got rid of the provision before the Ninth Circuit released its judgment.

Moreover, it must have been sobering to see PEN America filing an [amicus curiae brief](https://www.thefire.org/news/civil-liberties-orgs-line-support-professors-appeal-land-acknowledgment-lawsuit?ref=quillette.com) in my support; as well as the favourable response from the editorial boards of the [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/23/washington-first-amendment-land-acknowledgement/?ref=quillette.com) and [*Wall Street Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/university-of-washington-land-acknowledgement-ninth-circuit-professor-stuart-reges-c5b4e474?ref=quillette.com) following my legal victory.

Nevertheless, the university’s administrators may well try to drag out the process further, on the (hollow but well-practised) claim that punishing DEI apostates is necessary to protect students from “harm.” UW has requested a 45-day extension for filing an appeal, and is likely to request that the case now be heard *en banc* (with eleven presiding judges instead of just three) before it goes back to the lower court on remand.

These are stubborn institutional actors, reluctant to eat crow, eager to protect their professional reputations as zealous social-justice stalwarts, and equipped with an essentially unlimited litigation budget. Neither the fact that they’re swimming directly against the anti-DEI tide, nor the fact that they’ve already decisively lost the PR battle surrounding my case, may be enough to deter them.

I get the occasional student wandering into my office with questions about all this. One talented undergraduate opened by asking, “Why do you say these things when you know they’ll get you in trouble?” In such cases, I try to explain that this is part of a larger struggle.

My university has changed, and not for the better. Students used to stay up until the wee hours debating dicey topics without having to worry about their friends [reporting](https://www.washington.edu/civilrights/making-a-report/make-a-report/?ref=quillette.com) them to in-house commissars. Faculty would invite a wide range of speakers to campus, often while keeping their own political views private. Campus was a place where you’d often encounter vigorous debate, in which participants disagreed without being disagreeable.

In this kind of environment, academics could employ satire to pierce some hallowed but dubious principle insisted upon by the other side—without worrying that doing so might get them taken up on charges of heresy.

This young man told me he was hoping to become a social-science researcher. But the more he sees of campus life, the more he’s become convinced he should find a different career path. I’d love to convince him he really does have a bright future as an academic. But, in light of my own saga, I’m just not seeing it.

While I’m grateful to the Ninth Circuit, I also know that not every academic has the desire or means to spend years in litigation just to backstop their right to author a single satirical barb. Ultimately, restoring the broad-minded liberal spirit that once animated higher education is a project that will have to originate from within universities, not from the courts.
