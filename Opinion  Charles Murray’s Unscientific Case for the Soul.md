Charles Murray interprets anecdotes of “terminal lucidity,” unresponsive neurological patients coming to life for a final goodbye, as evidence for an immaterial soul (“ [Can Science Reckon With the Human Soul?](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/can-science-reckon-with-the-human-soul-76cdb7b6?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcpG6qK7AFGwfNFzzRNggU68JwcVB8I4i_YVN5qktp2BXyoFyagrVH1JOOeyho=&gaa_ts=6901272a&gaa_sig=R4X9YlncJ5Z1WRMY5lJi22LGeyM8AYLiUZNd_XmCYtpnrIzXmaGmnxLXRKbdhjcbdI2WPXT-xO0PlTlcTbFOVA==&mod=article_inline),” Houses of Worship, Oct. 17). He admits that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Yet his “soul of the gaps” argument—there’s something we don’t understand, therefore the soul did it—is extraordinarily weak.

The human brain, with 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections, is the most complex object in the known universe. No neuroscientist claims we understand its workings. Memory and intelligence are distributed across noisy, redundant circuits, which excite and inhibit each other in intricate networks and feedback loops. If one circuit deteriorates, another circuit it suppresses can rebound, including long-dormant copies. Many unpredictable eruptions of activity are possible. None of this implies a ghost in the machine.

But must we accept Mr. Murray’s reports as scientific data? Psychologists know that people are credulous about the cognitive abilities of those who matter to them, overinterpreting simple responses as signs of cogitation. In the 1960s, a primitive chatbot that mindlessly aped a therapist had people pouring their hearts out to it. With “facilitated communication,” parents were convinced they were liberating the trapped thoughts of their autistic children through a keyboard, unaware they were manipulating their children’s hands.

When there is desperation to commune with a loved one, any glimmer of responsiveness can be interpreted as lucidity, exaggerated with each recall and retelling. What Mr. Murray doesn’t report is documentation of any objective indicator of intelligence in these patients, such as a neurological battery or a test of verifiable autobiographical details.

The theory of the soul is itself incoherent. If a dybbuk can re-enter a ravaged brain as a gift to loved ones longing for a last goodbye, why are only a few people blessed with this miracle? Why did the soul leave in the first place, sentencing the loved ones to years of agony? Why can’t the soul stay put, making everyone immortal? What about patients who decline gradually: Do they have half a soul, then a quarter, and so on? How does the soul move the muscles of the tongue and throat? Might a patient with an empty skull become lucid? If so, why do we need a brain at all?

The scientific consensus that the mind consists of intricate activity in an unfathomably complex brain, which, like all organs, is vulnerable to disease and decay, suffers from none of these paradoxes.
