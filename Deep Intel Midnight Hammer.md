### The Mooch Report—June 23, 2025

## An Immaculate Deception…

Team Mooch has been diving deep into the details of the strike against the Iranian nuclear program, including B-2s dropping GBU-57 bunker busters and American submarines deploying a fusillade of TLAMs two hit three key sites simultaneously.

It was a meticulously-planned operation that coordinated more than 100 aircraft, some deploying from bases in the US on 18-hour flights. More than just the coordination of so many assets over such great distances was the intricate deception campaign that accompanied Operation Midnight Hammer, including decoy flights of B-2 Spirit bombers flying west, while the strike package launched stealthily east.

While the Israeli strikes preceding the US hit were extremely complex and difficult, Operation Midnight Hammer seemingly took Rising Lion to the next level. Suffice it to say, the story of this complex mission is still unfolding.

Stay tuned for more updates. And as always, keep us posted on your thoughts and feedback.

**ENCORE:** The first sorties of Rising Lion involved more than 200 aircraft including F-16s, F-15s, and F-35s (notably launching without radar reflectors, which means they did the mission in stealth mode) loaded with GBU-24 and GBU-31 bunker busting precision guided bombs that hit over 100 targets across Iran.
