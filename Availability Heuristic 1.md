The availability heuristic, also known as availability bias, is a cognitive bias that influences decision-making by favoring information that is more readily available or easily recalled. This heuristic operates under the principle that if something can be thought of, it is considered important or more likely to occur. It is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision. The bias is inherently biased toward recently acquired information, and the mental availability of an action's consequences is positively related to those consequences' perceived magnitude. In simpler terms, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something, the greater those consequences are often perceived to be [1][2][3][4].

This heuristic was first coined by Nobel-prize-winning psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1973. It suggests that information that is more easily brought to mind is assumed to reflect more frequent and/or more probable events, while information that is more difficult to bring to mind is assumed to reflect less frequent and/or less probable events [2][3].

The availability heuristic can lead to systematic errors in thinking, as it often causes people to overestimate the likelihood of relatively uncommon events. This can affect decisions and may even impact well-being if it leads to distress and worry [3]. The heuristic stems from how the brain works, relying on shortcuts to help make understanding the world faster and easier due to limited attention and information-processing power. The trade-off for this ability to make snap judgments is that sometimes our assessments and decisions are inaccurate [3].

It's important to note that the availability heuristic is sometimes confused with the representativeness heuristic, which is a different mental shortcut where we estimate the probability of an effect based on how well the current example matches an example we already have in mind [3].

While awareness of the availability heuristic alone cannot change personal thought processes, it can help ensure systematic changes in regard to supporting or implementing policies. For instance, taking measures to identify and remove biased information in our legal system is crucial for ensuring fair treatment for everyone, especially minority groups that are disproportionately affected by the availability heuristic [1].
