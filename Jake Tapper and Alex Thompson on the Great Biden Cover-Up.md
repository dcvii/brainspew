In 2023 and 2024, there were many things that were unsayable. Perhaps the most unsayable—at least in legacy media circles—was this: The President of the United States was not capable of being president because he was no longer mentally fit.

Those people who did break the taboo—who dared to notice Biden’s countless gaffes and stiff gait, those who recognized the reality of old age—including special counsel Robert Hur—were written off or smeared. Videos of the president—clips of Biden tripping and misspeaking—were rebranded by *The New York Times* as “cheap fakes.” People were told to disbelieve their eyes and ears.

It’s now the spring of 2025. Donald Trump is the president. And now the unsayable things are being said—most dramatically in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s new book, *[Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9798217060672)*.

Tapper, a CNN anchor, and Thompson, an *Axios* reporter, interviewed more than 200 people for this book, which illuminates Biden’s mental decline, his enablers, and how the country was effectively run by committee in the midst of his clear cognitive impairment.

For those of us who thought it was bad—it was actually so much worse than anyone could have imagined.

Alex and Jake have chosen to call the effort to hide Biden’s decline a “cover-up.” Those are choice words from two mainstream media insiders, invoking memories of Watergate and Iran-Contra. And the cover-up they are referring to, of course, is that of the Biden family and the close circle of advisers around them, many of whom are still delusional about Biden’s state.

But *cover-up* might be the term that many Americans would use to describe the press’s coverage of Biden. How did ordinary people see more than people with White House press passes? And what does this all say about human nature, transparency, and groupthink?

This is a really illuminating conversation about presidential power, the lengths some will go to keep it, and how the media failed to report the story of a lifetime.

***On how Biden hid the truth about his deterioration:***

**Bari Weiss**: For people that haven’t read *Original Sin*, tell us a little more about the crutches that allowed a nonfunctioning Biden to work.

**Alex Thompson**: All politicians prefer certain reporters at press conferences, and are usually directed to call on them. What started as an effort to make Biden look good grew more pronounced as he struggled. Every time Biden had a press conference, the White House press team handpicked the reporters. It became a crutch—they chose reporters who’d ask about topics he was comfortable with.

I covered the Biden White House for four years and never got a question. Once they picked you, the press team would cozy up and ask, “What are you interested in?” And sometimes reporters were just a bit too honest.

They filtered what the public saw by handpicking reporters. On the note cards—members of the cabinet told us there were scripts for cabinet meetings, not just when cameras were on, but even off-camera, before the meetings. This goes back to 2021. Aides, worried about him going off script, would go to cabinet secretaries and ask, “What do you want to ask?” or “If he asks this, what’s your answer?” One cabinet secretary literally described them as scripts. And sometimes the off-camera meetings were even weirder and more stilted.

**BW**: How so?

**AT**: Without cameras, they stuck to preselected answers. The White House would say cabinet meetings are always stilted, but even by that bar, they were odd, at times discursive, and troubling.

**Jake Tapper**: Just to pick up on that—these things evolve or devolve. In October 2023, they had their last cabinet meeting for almost a year. That’s shocking.

**BW**: How often are cabinet meetings typically held?

**JT**: Maybe four or five times a year. Depends on the president.

**BW**: And they’re usually sites of debate or passionate conversation about major issues?

**JT**: They should be. Not every presidency is like that, but if you’re the leader of the free world, it’s a key way to learn what’s going on in your administration. One-on-ones may be more productive, sure, but not having any meetings for a year is stunning.

**AT**: They were also shielding cabinet members from smaller meetings too. Several told us that.

**JT**: It started with teleprompters in the basement during the 2020 campaign. In 2021, it continued—understandable, we were still in Covid. But by 2023, he had teleprompters set up in the homes of donors for fundraisers. For meetings with 40 or 50 people.

Bari, if you were speaking to that size crowd—for *The Free Press* or a bar mitzvah—you’d speak for ten minutes. Anyone could. But the president couldn’t. And by 2023, this wasn’t the exception. It was the rule. People started getting alarmed—but privately.

***On how Biden and his aides squashed internal dissent:***

**BW**: Where were the voices around Biden—people like Jake Sullivan or Antony Blinken? People with integrity who understand the stakes of having a commander in chief who can’t function past 4 or 5 p.m.? What were they saying in 2022 and 2023?

**AT**: Two things. Even though the foreign policy team saw it, their view was distorted. If Biden got the right topic, he could clock back in. He was more engaged on foreign policy than other areas.

**JT**: Sometimes a lot more. Toward the end, when unrest in Syria and Assad’s fall happened, Biden was engaged. We’re not saying he was a vegetable. But he had really bad moments.

**AT**: Still, we talked to cabinet secretaries who didn’t believe he could handle a crisis that might unfold at 2 a.m.

**BW**: You quote a secretary saying, “If you expect the president to be woken up at 2 a.m., Biden was not capable of that in 2024.” Your reporting suggests he wasn’t capable of it in 2022 either.

**AT**: Definitely not in 2023. The secretary said 2024, but the signs were earlier.

**BW**: So how is no one internally saying, “This is not normal”? Where are those people?

**AT**: In Biden World, the defining virtue is loyalty. Dissent isn’t a conversation—it’s seen as disloyalty. Two things happened: People like pollster John Anzalone, who raised concerns, were sidelined. He raised questions about a real reelection process, and was told, “No, thanks.” He’s not part of the reelection.

That happened to many. Loyalty is enforced by Biden and Anthony Bernal, who was Jill Biden’s chief of staff. People got the memo: Don’t speak up or you’ll be pushed out.

Some things were done quietly—Bob Bauer, Biden’s longtime lawyer, had the Democratic National Committee get Hunter’s laptop, create a dossier of the worst details, and present it privately to Joe and Jill Biden. The message: This time, it’s all coming out. It will be painful.

**JT**: And that evidence would be introduced at trial.

**AT**: Exactly. But those were subtle gestures. No one, despite concerns about Biden’s ability to beat Trump or serve until 2029, got in his face.

***On how Biden’s condition affected his decision-making:***

**BW**: There were failures in Biden’s presidency—Afghanistan, the border, inflation. To what extent were those failures tied to his acuity?

**JT**: In June 2024, Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, goes to the White House for an immigration event. Biden glitches—not just forgetting Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas’s name, but something deeper.

Bennet leaves thinking, “This is why our immigration policy is such a mess—he can’t manage the competing interests.” Mayorkas expected a 2021 order to secure the border. Obama deported many—he was called “deporter-in-chief.” But that crackdown never came. Bennet thought Biden simply couldn’t handle it.

When it comes to the [American Rescue Plan](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/fact-sheet-the-american-rescue-plan-will-deliver-immediate-economic-relief-to-families), Biden’s big 2021 spending bill, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned it would be inflationary. We don’t know how much of that Biden was briefed on. His team wasn’t just hiding him from the world—they were hiding the world from him. Poll numbers, information—it was unhealthy. So yes, quite a bit was tied to his acuity. And we’re still reporting for the paperback.

***On the role of Hunter Biden:***

**JT**: I don’t have high regard for Hunter based on his role here. It’s tragic. His addiction and chaos caused a lot of his father’s decline. The plea deal falling apart in summer 2023, then the trial and conviction in 2024—those were moments of real deterioration for Biden.

It’s not just fear of Hunter going to jail—it’s fear of relapse or suicide. Biden already lost his wife and daughter in 1972, his son Beau in 2015. Losing his last child? He couldn’t recover from that.

Hunter, meanwhile, saw this as a chance for redemption—standing up for his dad, pushing him to run again, fighting back against Special Counsel Robert Hur and anyone trying to push him out.

At one point, Hunter talked about running for mayor of Wilmington. He wanted to show he had what Beau and his dad had. But in pushing Biden to run again, he couldn’t see what was happening.

The best advice—obvious in hindsight—was to take the legacy of one term and let a new generation of Democrats step forward. But he pushed his dad to stay. In 2023 and 2024, he wanted the White House to be the Hunter Biden defense organization. They said no. He and his allies were sidelined.

After the poor debate performance, the family blamed senior communications adviser Anita Dunn. She left the White House and joined the super PAC. There’s a price for crossing the Bidens—excommunication. Even loyal aides like Dunn and Bauer lost that battle with Hunter.

***On what made Biden drop out:***

**BW**: Given the drama, the three weeks after the debate feel anticlimactic. In the book, Schumer paints himself as the hero who finally speaks truth to power. But where was he before?

**JT**: He’s the only one we found who told the president not to run. Not Obama, Pelosi, Jeffries, Katzenberg—only Schumer.

**BW**: And that’s what made Biden finally decide?

**AT**: It was a combination. He didn’t want to divide the party. Maybe he could win the nomination, but it would be ugly. Then he caught Covid, was isolated in Rehoboth.

**JT**: And it really sucked. If you’re 81 and have Covid, it’s serious.

**AT**: Schumer being blunt—saying the majority of senators didn’t think he should run—meant something to Biden. He spent 36 years in the Senate. Other operatives made the case there was another path, that he couldn’t win anymore. I also think there may be more we don’t know yet. This is the first draft, not the last.

**JT**: We’ll add more in the paperback. He was so—

**AT**: So defunct. He still thinks he could’ve won. He believed it was winnable. And if you think Trump is a threat, why drop out? Was it just Covid?

**BW**: Or was it that he has metastatic prostate cancer?

**AT**: I wasn’t speculating that, but—

**BW**: Because that’s the perfect transition. Right before your book drops, they announce he has stage four prostate cancer. And people like Dr. Zeke Emanuel—hardly Biden critics—say there’s [no way it was a recent diagnosis](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-prostate-cancer-zeke-emanuel-morning-joe-2074140). He’s probably had it for 5–10 years. Did they lie?

**JT**: We don’t have reporting that contradicts their version: diagnosed Friday, announced Sunday.

**BW**: Right before the book drops.

**JT**: People are skeptical—we get that. Even people in the Biden White House are skeptical. But we don’t have the reporting.

What it underscores is how opaque this all is. These are the most sensitive, personal subjects. We believe presidents should disclose everything—every medication, every test result. But that’s not how it works. There’s sympathy for leaders on health. We’re on the honor system. Is it possible he hasn’t had a [PSA test](https://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/psa) since 2014? Maybe. But that’s the blood test relevant to the prostate, and for someone running the country—not the average 70-year-old—you’d think they’d want to know.

***Jake Tapper’s response to online criticism:***

**BW**: The backlash that I’m seeing is largely coming from X. I don’t go on Bluesky. I’m sure it’s happening there too.

**JT**: I had to get off on October 8, 2023, for obvious reasons.

**BW**: Right, so a lot of what I’m seeing, Jake, is not directed at Alex, who has been reporting on this.

**JT**: I’m seeing some nasty stuff about Alex. I’ll share it with you later.

**BW**: I would say it’s largely focused on you, perhaps because you have a huge show on CNN every night, perhaps because they’ve read Alex’s wonderful reporting in *Axios*—who knows. But it’s more focused on you and there are some specific clips that are getting circulated a lot, specifically one where [Lara Trump is on your show](https://youtu.be/1qD0WtSpfAc?feature=shared).

**JT**: It was October 2020, it was four and a half years ago.

**BW**: She basically suggests what the reporting in this book suggests—that she’s looking at an enfeebled president who’s not fully *compos mentis*. And you sort of glibly dismiss her. And I wondered if you could reflect on that a little bit. I know you called her, but when you’re watching that clip, what version of yourself do you see?

**JT**: I don’t want to make excuses for it. We live on TV and so we die on TV. Things that we say age well or age poorly—and that one aged poorly.

I see somebody who is interviewing a member of the Trump family right before an election, and I think that Joe Biden is old, but I do not have any reports suggesting that he is in cognitive decline. I know that I have been shocked by the things that members of the Trump family are saying about President Biden—then Vice President Biden. Don Jr. is out there literally suggesting he’s a pedophile on Instagram and such. I didn’t think much of what she was saying, but she was right and I was wrong.

I think that there is a big, big difference between the Joe Biden of 2020 and the Joe Biden of 2024, as our reporting bears out. And there’s also a big, big difference between what I am saying now—having reported this book—and the information she had. Although again, our reporting suggests that there were moments of cognitive impairment that he was having as far back as 2015.

I would also say, in terms of my reflection on this, just in the last couple weeks, some of those clips that you mentioned—the Lara Trump one is totally fair. That’s fine. It’s accurate. I said it. I did it. I own it.

But some of the clips are deceptively edited. I’m not going to call them “cheap fakes,” but they are me saying what *The* *Washington Post* is accusing somebody of doing, and they edit out me citing *The* *Washington Post*. Or it’s me interviewing Franklin Foer about his book on Biden and making it sound as though I am saying what I am paraphrasing Franklin Foer saying. And on and on. Whatever—this is the world that we’re in.

But when the publicists for the book went to *The* *Wall Street Journal* editorial page or Fox News—when I reached out to a Republican senator—who all used these clips without even researching them or anything like that and said “These are out of context,” they were not greeted with the response of, “Oh, I’m so sorry, I’ll correct the record,” or “That’s not true,” or “Let me see what the reality is.” What was the response? They don’t care. They ignore it. It doesn’t matter. Moving on.

I’m okay reflecting and looking back and saying, “I wish I’d done this better.” I wish I had been more aggressive. What Lara Trump said turned out to be accurate based on my reporting. And here is our book showing this reporting. And I think this book is important. The reason why this book is getting attention is because airing those clips and making fun of President Biden is not actually reporting. It’s commentary—and it’s fine, and I’m not criticizing it—but what we do in this book is actually show what was going on behind the scenes.

But I’m fine being the person that reflects and says, “You know, I got that wrong,” or “I could have done that better,” in contrast to these critics who, in the name of media criticism, are being untruthful and don’t care.

**BW**: But would you say that, looking back at the body of your work during the Biden White House, you could have brought a level of skepticism, scrutiny, and curiosity to this story?

**JT**: Of course. There are very few members of the legacy media that I don’t think could say that. But I will say that in October 2020, I interviewed Joe Biden, and I asked if he would take a pledge to be transparent about his health. And in October 2022, the only time I had an interview with him during his presidency, I pointed out that the American people think he’s too old. Whenever he’s asked about that, he says, “Watch me.” They’re watching him. They still think that.

I had skeptical interviews with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in 2023. And I was not a Robert Hur basher. I completely thought that he was accurate. And I didn’t understand what I was seeing from the White House or from other journalists that didn’t see what we were all seeing.

So I think that there is reporting that I’m proud of that is also part of the record. But on the whole, I wish these 200 sources had talked to us two years ago. And I wish I’d known what I know now. I would not say I was incurious. I would say that I was one of the many people who was asking about this and was lied to—over and over.

You have to remember, the Biden people were not only lying to the press and to the public—they were lying to donors, cabinet secretaries, Democratic members of Congress. A cover-up, and almost a successful one. Even though we all saw him aging, we didn’t know he had these moments of nonfunctioning. It suggests that there’s a lot of people in on something. And whether they were doing it because they believed it or they had been told it, at the end of the day, the Democrats did this. At the end of the day, the Biden family and the politburo—his senior aides— did this.

And yes, there were those of us who should have pushed back more. But if you can’t get officials to tell you it’s really bad behind the scenes—let me tell you how bad it is—I don’t know what more we could have done. And I wish that those people had been more willing to talk to the press.

***On continued Democratic reluctance to blame Biden:***

**JT**: I think that one of the things that’s been surprising is that I would think that there would be a Democratic presidential candidate in 2029 or whatever who would come out and say something along the lines of: “We have to be honest with the American people. We can’t let that happen again.”

And you have seen glimmers of it from Rep. Ro Khanna, Senator Chris Murphy. Pete Buttigieg said something about how it was obvious that Biden shouldn’t have run again. People just dipping their toe in it.

I think that there are a lot of Democrats who still don’t want to talk about this and still don’t want to confront the fact that Joe Biden and his team were part of a cover-up and a deception campaign that ended up delivering Donald Trump back to the White House.

They just don’t want to accept it. They want to blame me, or *New York Times* reporter Maggie Haberman, or Trump, or Fox, or whatever. But there’s no degree among the Democratic base to reckon with what they are part of.
