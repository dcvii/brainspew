[Did slavery lead to racism in America?](https://www.quora.com/Did-slavery-lead-to-racism-in-America)

Yes. Slavery first, racism next.

Students of history know that difference in the rights of African slaves in the colonies was established in the Virginia House of Burgesses. Slavery was normally practiced all over the world. And just like abortion today, some people were vehemently against it and others based on the economics of the situation escalated it to a ‘right’ in law.

To say that racism causes slavery is ridiculous. Slavery existed because people had no individual rights under feudal lords and kings. That was the way of the world for thousands of years. Nigerians enslaved Nigerians

. Russians enslaved Russians, Romans enslaved Romans, Egyptians enslaved Egyptians. Poles, Albanians, Serbs, Croats, Ukranians and dozens of other ethnics in Europe were and are known as Slavs. That’s not coincidence.

American slavery began just like every other slavery. But unlike everywhere else, Americans started writing and changing laws all over the place to justify their economic and personal interests. And so in the House of Burgesses laws

were passed for economic reasons to expand slavery. After these laws came bogus racial theories to justify slavery.

Slavery and indentured servitude came first. Laws expanding slavery came next. Ideological racism came after.

It's worth noting that the Spanish normalized the importation of Black slaves decades before America because the native population had been decimated by their Spanish rulers and they needed more laborers.

I wonder why you don’t mention the slavery of the Jewish people who were forced into first in Egypt, and then many years later in Germany That would make them the most enslaved people on earth, so what would be the reason you mentioned every other group yet left them out? Why???[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

No reason whatsoever. I can make my point without including the Jews, but certainly Jews were slaves

Thank you for your honest reply.

Sure,okay. There were feudal lords and kngs in the antebellum South.[Michael David Cobb Bowen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen)

Are you suggesting that slavery only existed in the antebellum South, or are you suggesting that feudal lords and kings did not own slaves?

Vivian Turnage Leese

No to both conjectures. There was no difference in the choices one had, whether it be as the indentured servants or as the slaves if one lived under the rule of feudal lords and kings.FYI: There were more slaves sold in New York City than there ever were in Charleston. Even Lincoln owned slaves. Slavery was legal then. It was accepted in society and was quite the norm in the 1800s.

Racism started after slaves became free, many of whites didn't want them here, they wanted them to go back to Africa because they did not want retaliation, and many did retaliate and that's what caused racism[Sophia Dawkins](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sophia-Dawkins-12)

This is not remotely true. It was widely held that Africans were inferior as far back as the mid 1700s. There is a ton of textual evidence including the writings of the Founding Fathers that attests to this. And no, black “retaliation” after the end of slavery was not common at all. White retaliatio…

American slavery began for 1 reason and 1 reason only. Economics. It was the only time in all of recorded human history that slavery had been instituted solely for economic reasons. Africans were chosen as the “victims” because Africans came from a land that was naturally hot, year round and the Euro…
