What actually happened with Net Neutrality? Who predicted correctly?

---

## Executive Summary

Net neutrality in the United States has followed a **regulatory pendulum** rather than a single decisive outcome. The dire predictions from both supporters and opponents largely **did not fully materialize**. Instead, the broadband market evolved in more incremental ways shaped by competition, platform power, and state regulation.

Below is a clear timeline and an assessment of who was closest to correct.

---

## Timeline: What Actually Happened

### 2005–2014: Early Principles and Legal Fights

- The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopts early “Internet Policy Statement.”
- Courts repeatedly limit FCC authority when broadband is classified as an information service.
- Major cases:
	- Comcast Corp. v. FCC (2010)
	- Verizon v. FCC (2014)

**Reality:** The legal foundation was unstable from the beginning.

---

### 2015: Strong Net Neutrality Rules (Title II Era)

Under FCC chair Tom Wheeler:

- Broadband reclassified under Title II (common carrier).
- Bright-line bans on:
	- Blocking
	- Throttling
	- Paid prioritization
- General conduct rule added.

**Context:** Heavy political pressure after the “fast lanes” controversy.

---

### 2017–2018: Repeal (“Restoring Internet Freedom”)

Under FCC chair Ajit Pai:

- Title II classification removed.
- Rules largely repealed.
- Enforcement shifted toward the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

**Key point:** This is when most predictions were made.

---

### 2018–2023: Post-Repeal Reality

What actually occurred:

- No widespread blocking of major websites.
- No systematic paid prioritization market emerged.
- Internet speeds continued to increase.
- Investment trends were mixed but generally stable.
- States (especially California) passed their own net neutrality laws.
- Edge platforms (Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc.) gained far more power than ISPs.

---

### 2024–2025: Re-regulation Attempts

- FCC moved again to restore Title II classification (another swing).
- Ongoing litigation and political uncertainty remain.

**Bottom line:** The U.S. is in a **policy oscillation**, not a settled regime.

---

## Who Predicted Correctly?

### Prediction #1: “The Internet Will Break Without Net Neutrality”

**Advocates included:** many digital rights groups and some tech companies.

**What they predicted**

- ISPs would block websites.
- Widespread paid fast lanes.
- Startups would be crushed.
- Prices would spike.

**What actually happened**

- Large-scale blocking: ❌ did not occur
- Paid prioritization market: ❌ largely did not materialize
- Startup collapse: ❌ did not occur
- Catastrophic price spikes: ❌ not observed

**Verdict:****Mostly overstated in the short to medium term.**

However, they were directionally correct that:

- ISPs retained the technical ability.
- Regulatory uncertainty persists.
- Zero-rating and subtle prioritization issues did arise.

---

### Prediction #2: “Repeal Will Have No Meaningful Effect”

**Advocates included:** many ISPs and deregulatory economists.

**What they predicted**

- Investment would rise.
- Innovation would flourish.
- Market competition would discipline ISPs.
- Regulation was unnecessary.

**What actually happened**

- Investment: mixed evidence, not a clear surge
- Competition: still weak in many U.S. regions
- ISP behavior: mostly restrained (but partly due to scrutiny and state laws)
- Market discipline: limited where broadband monopolies exist

**Verdict:****Also overstated.**

They were correct that:

- The Internet did not immediately degrade.
- Catastrophic harms did not appear.

They were wrong that:

- Competition alone would strongly discipline ISPs everywhere.
- Repeal would clearly boost investment.

---

## The Quiet Reality Most People Missed

### 1\. The Power Shift Happened — But Not Where Expected

The biggest structural change since 2015 has been:

- ISPs did **not** become the dominant gatekeepers.
- Large platforms did.

Companies like:

- Google
- Amazon
- Netflix
- Apple

now exert more practical control over traffic visibility and monetization than most ISPs.

**Many early debates misidentified the future chokepoint.**

---

### 2\. Technical Reality: Paid Prioritization Is Hard to Monetize

One underappreciated factor:

- Modern CDNs
- Edge caching
- Peering agreements
- Encryption (HTTPS everywhere)

These reduce the leverage ISPs have over specific content flows.

This dampened the feared fast-lane market.

---

### 3\. State Net Neutrality Laws Blunted the Experiment

Especially:

- California net neutrality law (SB-822)

Large ISPs often chose **nationwide compliance** rather than fragmented behavior.

This materially limited observable effects.

---

## So Who Was Closest to Right?

### Short-Term Accuracy: Deregulation Skeptics Were Too Alarmist

The Internet did not immediately fragment or degrade.

---

### Structural Analysis: Both Sides Missed Key Dynamics

**Most accurate nuanced view (in hindsight):**

- Immediate catastrophe: unlikely ✔️
- Long-term incentive risks: real ✔️
- Competition problems in broadband: persistent ✔️
- Platform power would eclipse ISP power: underappreciated ✔️
- Policy would oscillate politically: absolutely ✔️

---

## The Current Equilibrium (2026)

Today’s practical reality:

- Technical neutrality mostly preserved in practice.
- Legal status unstable.
- Broadband competition still uneven.
- Platform dominance far more consequential than ISP throttling.
- Policy remains politically reversible every few years.

---

## If You Want the Strategic Take

Given your Southwall-style architectural thinking:

The net neutrality fight was fundamentally about **where network power concentrates**.

It turned out the more decisive layers were:

- CDN layer
- Cloud layer
- App store layer
- Identity layer

—not the last-mile ISP in most cases.

---

If useful, I can next produce:

- A layered control-point map of the modern Internet stack
- Or a game-theoretic model of ISP vs platform incentives
- Or implications for your agentic / data-pipeline architecture

Just say the word.

---

Did Congress come up with a permanent fix? Are there any bills pending?

---

## Short Answer

- **No**, Congress has not enacted a permanent net neutrality law.
- **No major federal bill is currently advancing toward passage.**
- As of 2025–2026, the issue remains unresolved and largely in regulatory and judicial limbo.

Below is the precise state of play.

---

## 1\. Congress: No Permanent Fix

Despite nearly two decades of debate:

- Congress has **never passed a statute mandating or banning net neutrality**.
- Policy has instead been handled by the FCC through regulatory classification fights.

This is the core reason the issue keeps oscillating.

### Why this matters (structurally)

Without legislation:

- Each FCC majority can reverse course
- Courts keep re-litigating authority
- Industry faces regulatory uncertainty

From a systems perspective, it’s classic **administrative whipsaw risk**.

---

## 2\. The 2025 Court Decision Changed the Game

A major recent development:

### What the Sixth Circuit held

In **Ohio Telecom Association v. FCC (2025)**:

- The court ruled the FCC **lacks authority** to impose net neutrality via Title II.
- The decision leaned heavily on the Supreme Court’s rollback of Chevron deference.

### Practical implication

The court effectively signaled:

> If net neutrality is going to exist nationally, **Congress must write it into law.**

Even FCC leadership has publicly urged Congress to act after the ruling.

---

## 3\. Are There Bills Pending?

### Current federal landscape (2025–2026)

- There is **no major net neutrality bill moving through Congress right now**.
- Historically proposed bills (e.g., Save the Internet Act variants) have stalled.
- The CRS noted no enacted federal mandate and limited legislative movement.

### Why nothing is moving

The issue is politically cross-pressured:

- Democrats generally favor codification
- Republicans generally oppose Title II-style regulation
- Telecom and Big Tech are split stakeholders
- Broadband funding politics have taken priority

Result: **legislative gridlock**.

---

## 4\. What Actually Governs the Internet Today

### Federal level

- FCC authority currently constrained by the 2025 court ruling.
- No durable nationwide neutrality regime.

### State level (important)

States — especially California — still enforce their own rules.

This creates a **de facto partial neutrality regime** because:

- Large ISPs tend to operate nationally
- Compliance fragmentation is costly
- So many providers follow California-style rules broadly

---

## 5\. What Would a Real “Permanent Fix” Require?

For true stability, Congress would need to:

- Amend the Communications Act explicitly
- Define broadband classification
- Specify allowed vs prohibited traffic management
- Clarify FCC enforcement authority

Politically, that is a **high-friction legislative lift**.

---

## Strategic Read (your kind of takeaway)

From a systems and regulatory-risk perspective:

- Net neutrality is **not settled law**
- The FCC alone likely cannot permanently impose it
- Congress is the only durable path
- Near-term congressional action is unlikely
- State regimes will continue to fill the vacuum

---

## If you want the deeper angle

Given your interest in infrastructure control points, I can next map:

- Where neutrality actually bites in modern cloud/CDN architectures
- How ISPs technically could implement prioritization today
- Or the regulatory risk model for a fintech/data platform

Say the word.

---

What materially do ISP providers in California and NY which is special in complaince with their state regulations?

---

## Executive Summary

In **California** and **New York**, ISPs do not typically operate radically different networks. Instead, they implement **policy, product, and compliance controls** to satisfy state net-neutrality laws. The changes are mostly:

- contractual
- traffic-management governance
- product design constraints
- internal compliance monitoring

—not wholesale technical re-architecture.

Below is what materially changes.

---

## The Governing State Laws

- California — SB-822 (strongest state net neutrality law)
- New York — broadband neutrality tied to state procurement rules

California is the **hard constraint**; New York is more **indirect but still influential**.

---

## What ISPs Actually Have to Do

### 1\. Prohibit Blocking, Throttling, Paid Prioritization

**Material requirement**

ISPs must ensure they do not:

- block lawful content
- throttle based on application/service
- sell paid fast lanes

**Operational impact**

- Network policy engines must be neutral by default
- Product teams cannot design “priority internet” tiers
- Peering/CDN arrangements must avoid discriminatory routing

**What changed in practice**

- Many providers froze or removed experimental traffic shaping policies
- Legal review added to QoS rule changes

---

### 2\. Restrict Zero-Rating and Sponsored Data (California Especially)

This is one of the **most material differences**.

California prohibits:

- app-specific zero-rating (e.g., “Netflix doesn’t count against your cap”)
- discriminatory data-cap exemptions

**What ISPs do**

- Avoid app-specific free-data programs
- If zero-rating exists, make it category-neutral or eliminate it
- Review mobile plan marketing carefully

**Why this matters**

Historically, zero-rating was the **most likely monetization lever** for ISPs.

---

### 3\. Formal Network Management Justifications

California requires that:

- “reasonable network management” be genuinely technical
- not commercially motivated

**Material compliance behavior**

ISPs must maintain:

- documented traffic management policies
- engineering justification for congestion controls
- audit trails showing neutrality

**In practice**

This mostly affects:

- internal governance
- legal/compliance overhead
- change-management workflows

—not the packet plane itself.

---

### 4\. Disclosure and Transparency Requirements

ISPs must publicly disclose:

- traffic management practices
- performance metrics
- commercial terms affecting traffic

**Operational effects**

- Expanded FCC-style broadband labels
- Legal review of public disclosures
- periodic compliance reporting

This is more **paperwork heavy than compute heavy**.

---

### 5\. Procurement Compliance (New York’s Special Lever)

New York’s approach is structurally different.

Instead of direct regulation, the state says:

> If you want state contracts, you must follow neutrality principles.

**Material impact**

Large ISPs that serve:

- schools
- municipalities
- state agencies

generally adopt **nationwide compliance** to avoid fragmentation.

This is a classic **market-access enforcement model**.

---

## What ISPs Did Not Have to Change

From a systems architecture standpoint, most of the following remained largely untouched:

- core routing architecture
- CDN interconnect strategy
- peering fabric
- backbone capacity planning
- DOCSIS / fiber access tech
- BGP policy fundamentals

This is important.

Your Southwall instincts are correct: **the packet plumbing largely stayed the same**.

---

## The Quiet Reality: Nationwide Compliance Strategy

Most Tier-1 ISPs chose:

> “Comply everywhere rather than build state-specific behavior.”

### Why

- Operational complexity of geo-policy routing is high
- Legal risk of accidental violation is high
- Consumer backlash risk is high
- California market is too large to ignore

**Result**

California effectively acts as a **national floor** for many providers.

---

## Where the Real Engineering Work Happens

If you were auditing an ISP for CA/NY compliance, you would focus on:

### Control Plane

- QoS classification rules
- DPI policy engines
- congestion-management triggers
- mobile core policy control (PCRF/PCF)

### Business Systems

- product catalog constraints
- billing and data-cap logic
- zero-rating flags
- partner agreements

### Governance Layer

- change management approvals
- legal review workflows
- compliance monitoring
- public disclosure pipelines

---

## Quantifying the Material Burden

For a large ISP, typical incremental cost is mostly:

- legal/compliance staff
- policy engineering time
- product constraints
- reporting overhead

**Not**:

- massive new hardware
- major bandwidth upgrades
- new routing fabrics

---

## Strategic Takeaway (relevant to your architecture mindset)

Net neutrality compliance today lives primarily in:

- policy engines
- billing logic
- product design
- legal governance

—not in the physical network core.

In modern networks, the real choke points have shifted upward to:

- CDNs
- hyperscalers
- mobile OS platforms
- app ecosystems

---

## If You Want to Go One Level Deeper

I can next produce one of the following:

- A packet-flow diagram showing where neutrality enforcement actually sits in a DOCSIS/fiber network
- A PCRF/PCF policy example showing how throttling would be implemented or prevented
- A risk model for a fintech platform relying on ISP neutrality

Say the word.

---

What actions, if any, in violation of these particular state regulations have been brought? What is the net differential in pricing for ISP services in these two states vs those with the looser regulations?

---

## What actually happened with net neutrality

- The US ended up with a patchwork.
- Federal rules have repeatedly flipped based on which FCC majority was in power (2015 Title II “Open Internet Order,” then the 2017 repeal).
- In 2024 the FCC attempted to restore federal net neutrality again (“Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet”).
- In January 2025, a federal appeals court blocked/struck down that 2024 restoration effort on the theory that the FCC lacked authority under the statute (notably in the post-Chevron legal environment after *Loper Bright*).
- Result: meaningful “net neutrality” constraints today are primarily state-based (plus narrower federal transparency rules like broadband labels).

## Who “predicted correctly”

It depends on what you mean by “net neutrality wins.”

- If you mean “we’ll get durable federal net neutrality,” the accurate prediction was: it would take Congress to settle it permanently, because agency authority would keep getting litigated and could be narrowed by courts. That’s essentially the takeaway in CRS legal analysis after the 2025 decision.
- If you mean “states can and will fill the gap,” that also largely happened: California kept its comprehensive law, and other states used procurement / funding levers.

## Did Congress come up with a permanent fix

- No permanent, generally-applicable federal “net neutrality” statute has been enacted that settles the classification / preemption fight across the entire US (as of Feb 20, 2026).
- CRS continues to frame congressional action as the clean way to resolve the underlying statutory problems (and, if Congress wants, to define how much states can do).
- I did not find a major net-neutrality-codifying bill in the 119th Congress with meaningful traction comparable to earlier efforts like the *Save the Internet Act* (116th).

## Are there any bills pending

### Federal (Congress)

- I did not find an active, prominent, standalone net-neutrality-codification bill moving through Congress in 2025–2026 in the way the older 116th-Congress bills did. (There are broadband bills, but not a clear “restore and lock in net neutrality” vehicle advancing.)

### New York (state)

- New York has had procurement-based net-neutrality policy via Executive Order 175 since 2018 (see below), and there is also state legislation activity around net-neutrality concepts (example: NY Senate bill page for S6066, 2025 session, styled as a “net neutrality protection” measure tied to state contracting).

## What ISPs in California and New York must do that’s “special”

### California (SB 822)

SB 822 is a comprehensive behavioral rule set (closest thing to “full net neutrality” at the state level).

- No blocking lawful content/apps/services/devices.
- No throttling (degrading or impairing) lawful traffic based on content/app/service.
- No paid prioritization (fast lanes).
- Restrictions on certain “zero-rating” practices (especially when used to advantage an ISP’s own or affiliated content or to create anticompetitive discrimination).

Practical compliance work this forces inside an ISP:

- Traffic-management policies must be content-agnostic (beyond “reasonable network management”).
- Product teams must vet pricing/bundling so “sponsored data” or zero-rating programs don’t cross SB 822 lines.
- Legal/compliance review becomes part of launch for any new differential-treatment feature (video optimization, gaming fast paths, app-based bundles, etc.).

### New York (EO 175) and NY’s separate affordability law

New York’s “net neutrality” lever is narrower than California’s and is mostly procurement-driven.

- Executive Order 175 directs NYS government not to contract for internet service unless the ISP agrees to adhere to net-neutrality-like principles (no blocking/throttling/paid prioritization) as a condition of getting state contracts.

Separately (not “net neutrality,” but often discussed alongside it), NY has an affordability/rate requirement for low-income plans:

- NY’s Affordable Broadband Act requires qualifying providers (based on size thresholds) to offer low-cost plans for eligible low-income households; it survived major litigation in the 2nd Circuit, and some providers reacted by changing their product availability (for example, AT&T exiting a specific 5G home internet offering in NY rather than complying for that product).

## What enforcement actions (violations) have been brought under these state net-neutrality regimes

### California SB 822

- The public, high-signal record is dominated by litigation over whether SB 822 could take effect (it ultimately could), rather than a long list of published penalty actions against ISPs for specific SB 822 violations.
- That does not mean “nothing happened” operationally; it more likely means compliance was handled quietly (policy changes, internal controls, or dispute resolution without splashy enforcement announcements). I did not find a clear, well-documented example of a major public SB 822 enforcement penalty case in the sources above.

### New York EO 175 (procurement condition)

- EO 175 is enforced mainly by procurement eligibility (you can lose state business if you won’t certify compliance).
- I did not find a well-documented public case of NYS formally debarring a major ISP under EO 175 (as opposed to the EO simply shaping contracting posture).

### New York affordability law (again, separate from net neutrality)

- Here, there is clearly documented litigation and compliance conflict (including product withdrawal decisions).

## Net differential in ISP pricing in CA/NY vs “looser” states

This is hard to answer cleanly as a causal question, because prices vary heavily with:

- Cost of living and operating costs (California is structurally higher-price on many goods/services).
- Market structure (cable vs fiber competition by metro, building density, municipal franchising conditions).
- Promo pricing, bundles, and fee structures (which can swamp small regulatory effects).

What we can say with evidence:

- California state analysis has cited very high “average monthly price” figures for common service tiers (example figure from the CA Public Advocates Office commentary: ~$116.68/month for a common 100–500 Mbps cable tier in California, in their affordability framing).
- National “average plan offer” estimates (not bills paid) are often much lower, commonly in the ~$50–$80 range depending on the methodology (example: Allconnect’s analysis puts average offered plan price around $75.72/month).

What I cannot support confidently from good sources:

- A single “net differential” number (e.g., “CA is X% more expensive because SB 822”) that isolates the effect of net-neutrality rules from everything else. I did not find a rigorous, widely-accepted state-by-state causal estimate in the sources surfaced here.

A reasonable interpretation, based on what’s documented:

- California and New York are expensive broadband markets largely for structural reasons (high RPP/cost base, dense metros with complex competitive dynamics), and the available evidence does not cleanly show that net-neutrality rules are the primary driver of retail price differences.

If you want, I can narrow this to a specific footprint (example: Spectrum/Charter 500 Mbps in Los Angeles vs Dallas vs Phoenix; Verizon Fios in NYC vs DC area) and compare current sticker and “all-in” prices using the FCC broadband labels dataset approach (where available).
