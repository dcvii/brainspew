Mozilla Data Collective is a platform in the truest sense. It’s yours to stand on, and make of it what you will. We have dual roots in two Mozilla projects - Common Voice, a CC0 public dataset to help tech speak your language - and the Data Futures Lab - an experimental space for instigating new approaches to data stewardship challenges. Mozilla Data Collective works by allowing you to share your data, retain ownership of it, and control who uses it.

We imagine and create a better future where AI is built equitably and powered by the people. We do this by providing alternative solutions that challenge extractive data practices by placing the power of how AI data is created and governed in the hands of the people.

Mozilla Data Collective is backed and stewarded by Mozilla Foundation - the non-profit, movement-building, and philanthropy arm of Mozilla.

We partner with organizations and individuals to make their data available through Mozilla Data Collective. You can share openly, using existing licenses like Creative Commons, or you can build your own. You can open up your data for everyone, or just for some types of downloaders, you can set custom constraints, ask for exchange, compensation or recognition. You can govern it as an individual, a co-operative, a trust or something else. After all, it’s your data. The people who access your datasets are authenticated, and held in legally binding contracts, and we have a number of dataset protection features.
