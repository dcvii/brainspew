Since the species climbed down from the trees, ideals of manhood, always and everywhere, have been bound up with physicality and struggle. Each man has been expected to be a *protector*—or provider, which amounts to the same thing. He is the defender of all that is sacred and good, the bearer of virile virtues—courage, strength, loyalty. Thus, the soldier protects the nation. The husband protects the wife; the father, his children.

In the end, physicality prevails.

In modern times, the question arises: What are men supposed to protect *against*? The perils of the ancestral environment probably shaped the human psyche, but today survive mainly as fodder for Hollywood fantasies. Protection against hunger and penury have become the responsibility of the state.

Meanwhile, the mortal enemy of man is, and forever has been, other men. Physical competition inevitably degrades into combat and murder. This is a depressing but ancient progression. The [frozen body](https://www.historyskills.com/classroom/ancient-history/anc-otzi-reading/) of a man 5,300 years old was found in 1991 with an arrowhead in his back, head trauma, and many additional wounds. He was a victim of male violence. Manhood means eternally protecting yourself and those under your care against the bully, the abductor, the rapist, the killer—the devouring Man-Beast at the heart of the social labyrinth.

According to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, [95 percent](https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf) of all convicted murderers in the world are men. For a rough idea of what this means, around 475,000 homicides [were committed](https://apps.who.int/violence-info/homicide/) worldwide in 2019. In the U.S. alone, [there were](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191137/reported-forcible-rape-cases-in-the-usa-since-1990/) 127,216 cases of rape reported in 2023; if sexual assault is included, 376,038 women [were victimized](https://www.statista.com/statistics/642458/rape-and-sexual-assault-victims-in-the-us-by-gender/) that same year. These numbers represent a continuous massacre. They fill the air with the sound of viciousness and suffering. Even as you, good reader, peruse these words, hundreds of individuals just like you are being slaughtered or brutalized.

I have called the perpetrator the Man-Beast. What can we say about him? He is not a figment of fiction or myth. The Man-Beast lives among us but never as one of us—a slave to his darkest impulses and his most sickening fantasies, he is a threat to those unfortunate enough to cross his path. While typically a moral cripple who hides in the dark corners of society, he can lead an outwardly normal life. The American serial killer [Dennis Lynn Rader](https://www.biography.com/crime/dennis-rader), who called himself “Bind, Torture, Kill,” had a wife and two children, held down a job, and was elected president of his church council. Yet he murdered at least 10 people, including an 11-year-old girl whom he hanged from a basement pipe.

The Man-Beast is the nihilist in the raw—a mutilator without a cause. He will kill over the slightest pretext: The outlaw John Wesley Hardin shot a man dead because his snoring annoyed him. One would think such a creature to be a misfire of the selfish gene, but he appears to fill a niche in a certain kind of society—staffing, for example, all the lower echelons of every dictatorship that has ruled by terror and violence. On rare occasions, he rises to high status, as did [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48913377) and [Harvey Weinstein](https://abcnews.go.com/US/harvey-weinstein-indicted-new-york-grand-jury/story?id=113599003). The intense public loathing heaped on these two men probably reflects a general fear that many more like them remain at large, safe within their lairs.

In the normal man’s ideal of manhood, he stands between the Man-Beast and everything that matters in the world. However, an influential line of thought, mandatory among the educated classes, refuses to make a distinction between the two. Man and Man-Beast, this outlook holds, are in truth identical. More: The Man-Beast has been portrayed as the very definition of manhood.

The #MeToo movement that began online in 2017 painted a terrifying portrait of American life, in which women at every turn, whether at work or at home, were harassed, assaulted, abused, and destroyed. The American Psychological Association’s “[Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men](https://www.apa.org/about/policy/boys-men-practice-guidelines.pdf)” (2018) literally treats “traditional masculinity ideology” as a kind of sickness, a psychological disorder triggered by a craving for “social power” and responsible not only for sexist or anti-woman behavior but also for racism, homophobia, and promiscuity. The cure, which is sometimes explicitly stated, always implied, is the eradication of manhood by dissolving it into a fluid menu of genders.

Is every man a Man-Beast? Only in the abstract can this be true. Any given man is far more likely than a woman to be a murderer or rapist, but few are so in fact. Otherwise, the statistics would look quite different. A society in which every man replicates the Man-Beast would be a [Hobbesian nightmare](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3207/3207-h/3207-h.htm)—a war of all against all, with tens of millions of murders per year and hundreds of millions of rapes.

Clearly, this isn’t the place we live in. The Man-Beast is somehow neutralized, and we must ask, by whom? Again, words like “society,” “the state,” or “the police,” are mere abstractions. In the end, it comes down to a physical confrontation. We know the Man-Beast is slain deep inside his labyrinth, and we know only a special type of human, the hero, can perform this deed.

On May Day of 2023, an evidently unhinged homeless man boarded the F train in the New York City subway and began to shout at the people there. Among other threats, he announced that [he wanted to kill](https://www.thefp.com/p/jordan-neely-daniel-penny-f-train-bodycam-video) and was willing to die in the process. A subway car is a closed microcosm. No help can be expected from outside. In this instance, one of the passengers, 24-year-old ex-Marine Daniel Penny, restrained the intruder with a prolonged choke hold; by the time the struggle was over, the man had died of suffocation.

“I saw the looks on the mother, on the school kids, on the other passengers—women, children,” Penny [later said](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/us/daniel-penny-whats-next/index.html). “I felt like the threats were imminent and something had to be done.”

He was a protector of the highest order: a hero. Yet he was [arrested and tried](https://www.city-journal.org/article/what-i-saw-at-the-daniel-penny-trial?skip=1) for second-degree manslaughter, which, had he been convicted, carried a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. Because the dead man was black, Black Lives Matter protesters gathered outside the courtroom and made an uproar. When Penny was found innocent on all counts, a [BLM activist](https://www.newsweek.com/blm-leader-reaction-daniel-penny-verdict-jordan-neely-1997953) called for “black vigilantes” to retaliate, “People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud? How about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us?” Many of the city’s elite class still condemn Penny’s behavior on the train as reckless, lawless, and racist. The hero, in New York, was a tainted man.

In July 2024, at a crowded rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, presidential candidate Trump was [nicked by an assassin’s bullet](https://www.thefp.com/p/salena-zito-assassination-attempt-trump) that sliced his ear open and barely missed killing him. I have been where shots were fired. I can vouch that the overwhelming reflex is to hit the ground and make like a pancake. Trump pushed aside his Secret Service guards, aimed a fist at the sky, and exclaimed “Fight!” to the crowd—a heroic gesture, meant to reassure his supporters despite the horror of what they had just witnessed, that would alter the course of the campaign. The visuals of the Butler shooting [were so striking](https://www.thefp.com/p/in-trump-is-a-combat-leader-assassination-attemp) that cynics claimed it had been staged.

Trump’s heroic hour, however, was one brief moment in a life trajectory that even loyal followers would admit contained many unsavory episodes, particularly when it came to his [treatment of women](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/16/trump-e-jean-carroll-second-lawsuit-00135610). Trump was possibly a hero, but he would [never be a saint](https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0). Within days of the assassination attempt, a hostile media had reverted to labeling him a [potential dictator](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html) and a serial [misogynist](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/trump-nancy-pelosi-liz-cheney-women.html).

The hero slays the monster and so restores the moral balance of society, but he is rarely a bringer of harmony or domesticity. He smolders with an excess of the manly virtues, which he must constantly put to the test. He runs into the burning tower, not away from it. He leaps on the live grenade rather than seek cover. In him, the urge to protect is an almost pathological condition, leading in some circumstances to terrible crimes. Agamemnon sacrificed his own daughter so that the Achaean fleet could sail to conquer Troy. Romulus murdered his brother to ensure the foundation of Rome. James Bond leaves behind him a [trail of corpses](https://time.com/james-bond-spectre-007-deadliest/) and forsaken beauties.

But the hero is indispensable. Let there be no question about that. A society deprived of heroic energy would lack the power of redemption and would soon be overrun by the Man-Beast. But the hero, by definition, is an exceptional man. He is the refutation of the democratic principle. He might be a model of certain virtues for all men to aspire to, but he is also a warning: Even the instinct to protect, central to manhood, can be deformed by a lack of conviviality.

In addition, for all his nobility, the hero, we feel, is missing *something*. He has superhuman courage, strength, charisma, fury, pride, yet he appears somewhat inhuman to the modern eye. In the course of history, this missing quality was supplied by a Christian variant of the pagan hero: the *gentleman*.

With Christianity, and especially its secular offspring, Enlightenment liberalism, protection became the *duty* of all men worthy of their manhood. A very Christian quality—empathy—was important, too, particularly toward the weak and vulnerable: women and children first. Also added: a dash of medieval chivalry, along with another Christian virtue, modesty, particularly with regards to money, as Rudyard Kipling [described](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---) in his 1910 poem “If”:

> *If you can make one heap of all your winnings*
> 
> *And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,*
> 
> *And lose, and start again at your beginnings,*
> 
> *And never breathe a word about your loss…*

The gentleman doesn’t aim for greatness or fame but rather for decency. He is, John Henry Newman [informs us](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-a-gentleman-by-newman-1689960), “tender towards the bashful, gentle towards the distant, and merciful towards the absurd.” The world he builds is competitive but fair, protecting and elevating the voices that, in the Darwinian arena of the hero, would be cowed into silence. When he fights others who share his standards, he will apply the [Marquess of Queensberry](https://www.britannica.com/sports/Marquess-of-Queensberry-rules) rules—otherwise, he’s perfectly liable to bring a gun to a knife fight.

His ideal of manhood is to reduce, by personal effort, the wretchedness and cruelty of life—to push against the weight and wildness of nature until decency appears to be the default condition of the human race. He alone, the silent protector of civilization, stands between the Man-Beast and his prey.

But the gentleman stood at the pinnacle of an unequivocally man-ruled world. Although he opened the door, literally and figuratively, to women and marginalized groups, nothing in his background had prepared him for the consequences. He was, without question, a tad too smug, too condescending to deal with the conflicts and anxieties of postwar existence. Eventually, feminists—along with all right-thinking men—had no choice but to repudiate and deride the principles involved. For all that, the gentleman as a model of manhood perished from self-inflicted wounds, truly a death of despair.

In his place stood a slippery character, the technocrat, morally and sexually neutral but ready to rebuild society on a new basis. Instead of personal decency, we would get state-ordained welfare.

Postmodern manhood became amorphous, uncertain, problematic. But it was even worse for women. Were they supposed to be wives and mothers, ambitious careerists, or some third unique mode of being? Because nobody had the authority to decide, liberation meant confusion—and confusion, let’s be clear, entailed much distress.

The arrival of the internet compounded the chaos. The digital self—a flat, ethereal entity liberated from its own past—could be male, female, or any invented category imaginable. Not coincidentally, unhappy young women in all democratic nations began a [long march](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/16/gen-z-gender-gap-political-left-women) to the extreme identitarian left that soon resembled a war on men. A number of bizarre and arbitrary theses were proclaimed: that women could become men, and vice versa, simply by wishing it so; that children who [demanded genital mutilation](https://www.thefp.com/p/i-thought-i-was-saving-trans-kids) should be assisted by the medical profession and protected by the might of the state; that the “binary” division of the sexes was a snare of capitalist males, which one could escape to revel in a profusion of genders as easily as one could change one’s identity on the web. The enemy of this Eden of fluidity, to be sure, was old-fashioned manhood.

A sustained assault on the male virtues ensued. Because here was a paradox: Although the gentleman had gone extinct, his qualities were still widely admired. Nobody cared if you could do a perfect necktie knot, but you would earn esteem if you displayed extraordinary courage, honor, and decency. Daniel Penny, normal Americans knew, was a hero, not a murderer. Trump’s popularity improved after his brave showing in Butler. Women and children exited first from [the sinking airplane](https://people.com/human-interest/miracle-on-the-hudson-photos/) that went down in the Hudson River in January 2009; it was little different from what had transpired 97 years before, when the *Titanic* capsized.

Physical prowess, the foundation of manhood, is impossible to extinguish—but it can be downgraded and devalued. Standards of fitness for entering the military and various police forces have been [watered down](https://apnews.com/article/army-8107bd2d5ad1db574a72e98dd789fbff) until they are meaningless, to make allowance for women. Predictably, these institutions are in the midst of a profound recruitment crisis.

Deprived of the assurance of protection, the female half of the youngest generation has entered a state of permanent panic. There’s a febrile demand for safe spaces and trigger warnings. There’s an oppressive feeling of loss of agency and meaning—a dogmatic belief that the world will end in their lifetimes, regardless of their actions, from climate calamity or a viral pandemic. [Spiking rates](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/data-dive-gen-z-women-are-struggling-most-stress-mental-health-issues) of anxiety, depression, and suicide have afflicted young women. The number of young transexuals has also increased sharply, [the majority](https://nypost.com/2020/06/27/how-peer-contagion-plays-into-the-rise-of-teens-transitioning/) of them women who wish to be transformed into men. The unifying political issue for this cohort is abortion. [Having babies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/03/millennials-only-children/) has gone out of fashion.

In this desolate landscape, with men banished to the shadows, the Man-Beast waits for his moment. He already controls hundreds of neighborhoods in our urban centers. He recently made an appearance in yet another New York City subway train, where a man [burned a woman](https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/critics-say-bystanders-stood-by-while-illegal-migrant-burned-woman-to-death-on-nyc-subway-daniel-penny-effect/) alive; this time, passengers took video of the horror but refused to intervene. He’s the sniper who almost decapitated Trump. He’s [Luigi Mangione](https://abcnews.go.com/US/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect/story?id=116460289), who allegedly shot a health insurance CEO in the back, an act once considered cowardly but cool enough now to convert this Man-Beast into a sex symbol for fatuous females.

Yet even as the monster wreaked his violence and made the news, a radical reversal was taking place in the realm of politics.

With the advent of the Biden administration, the war on men became official. Biden chose a woman of color as his vice president merely for that reason, appointed a trans woman to be an admiral in the Pentagon, engaged in a legal crusade on behalf of transgenderism. [Sixty-three percent](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/09/how-biden-compares-with-other-recent-presidents-in-appointing-federal-judges/) of his judicial appointments were women. The administration’s favorite buzzword, “equity,” meant the punishment of men to compensate for their past transgressions. A flabbier or more flaccid style of government would be hard to conceive—but that was the spirit of the times. Many states followed suit.

Unlike their women, American men never migrated to the left. Some succumbed to fentanyl. Others embraced a morbid model of non-masculinity, [the “incel”](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9780135/)—men who have given up on physical contact with women. Testosterone levels underwent a [“substantial” decline](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17062768/). One observed little anger, much despair, and a consuming hunger for meaning—for an ideal of manhood that fulfilled the natural impulses to compete and protect. Young males flocked to self-improvement prophets like Jordan Peterson, who [told them](https://calvinrosser.com/notes/12-rules-for-life-jordan-peterson/) to “stand up straight with shoulders back” and accept “the terrible responsibility of life.”

Trump’s election, according to accepted wisdom, signified a revolt of these “normie” male voters against the regime that had demonized them. That’s certainly true. [Men of all backgrounds](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-support-among-men-reshaped-the-political-landscape/) gave the former president his winning margin. But Trump, we know, is a hero figure, in both the admirable and the reprehensible sense of that word. With his usual energy and tenacity, he will clean out the [Augean stables](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Herakles/stables.html) of his predecessor—but he will always show a heroic disdain for honor, respect, and decency. Some of Trump’s virtues can be emulated, but Trump the man is impossible to replicate—and that, let me say, is a good thing. A society made up of aspiring heroes would be like a choir composed entirely of prima donnas. The chaos and the noise would be unbearable.

The election settled the issue on one front of the sexual conflict. Men have regained their political manhood. But beyond vague talk of a “[vibe shift](https://niallferguson.substack.com/p/the-vibe-shift-goes-global),” the culture still considers “traditional masculinity ideology” to be a disease, a form of psychosis mandating immediate therapy. Characters in Hollywood films, when male, are either mutant superheroes or bumbling half-men. A *cultural* ideal of normal manhood is missing. One must be provided if men are to be anything more than eunuchs or buffoons. Such an ideal should connect physicality and combativeness to a higher purpose, and recognize the value of the protector to society. For that, we’ll need a living model. We have agreed that Trump is not it. Where, then, is he to be found?
