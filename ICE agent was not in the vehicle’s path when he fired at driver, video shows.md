A deadly [encounter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2026/01/07/minneapolis-shooting-ice/) in Minneapolis on Wednesday between federal Immigration and Customs Enforcementagents and [a 37-year-old woman](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/01/08/renee-good-ice-who-is/) escalated in a matter of seconds.

In the aftermath, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem said the woman had committed an act of “domestic terrorism,” first disobeying officers’ commands and then weaponizing her SUV by attempting to “run a law enforcement officer over.” President Donald Trump said the woman “violently, willfully and viciously ran over the ICE officer.”

A frame-by-frame analysis of video footage, however, raises questions about those accounts. The SUV did move toward the ICE agent as he stood in front of it. But the agent was able to move out of the way and fire at least two of three shots from the side of the vehicle as it veered past him, according to the analysis.

Video taken by a witness shows Renee Nicole Good’s vehicle, a burgundy Honda Pilot SUV, stopped in the middle of a one-way road in a residential area of south Minneapolis on [Wednesday morning.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/01/07/ice-shooting-minneapolis-immigration/) That footage and other videos examined by The Washington Post do not show the events leading up to that moment.

The agent, who has not been publicly identified, can be seen standing behind Good’s SUV, holding up a phone and pointing it toward a woman who also has her phone out. The two appear to be recording each other.

The agent then walks around the passenger side of Good’s vehicle.

A pickup truck pulls up, and two additional agents exit the vehicle and approach Good, the video shows. A voice can be heard saying to “get out” of the car at least two times. One of the agents puts a hand on the opening of the driver’s side window and with his other hand tugs twice quickly on the door handle, but the driver’s door does not open.

That same agent puts his hand farther in the opening of Good’s window, and almost simultaneously, the SUV begins to back up.

The agent who was first seen behind Good’s SUV reemerges in front of the vehicle, still appearing to hold up a phone. The SUV quickly pulls forward, and then veers to the right, in the correct direction of traffic on the one-way street.

As the vehicle moves forward, video shows, the agent moves out of the way and at nearly the same time fires his first shot. The footage shows that his other two shots were fired from the side of the vehicle.

Videos examined by The Post, including one shared [on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115855701696773990) by Trump, do not clearly show whether the agent is struck or how close the front of the vehicle comes to striking him. Referring to the officer, Trump wrote in his post that it was “hard to believe he is alive.” Video shows the agent walking around the scene for more than a minute after the shooting.

Good’s SUV travels a short distance before crashing into a car parked on the opposite side of the street.

The FBI and Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating the shooting. In response to a request for comment, the White House referred to the president’s past social media posts and Noem’s public statements that the officer was struck. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin replied in an email echoing the Noem’s assertion from Wednesday: “The individual in question hit the officer with the car.”
