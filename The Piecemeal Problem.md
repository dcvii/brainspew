So I was really excited this morning to find detailed data on the state of education in the US. I have heard from a number of reputable people, including [Ian Rowe](https://www.aei.org/profile/ian-rowe/), about the horrifying numbers of students at grade level in math. I’ve also heard from [Larry Sand](https://heartland.org/about-us/who-we-are/larry-sand/) about grade inflation in California. What I don’t have is the data.

So this morning I stumbled upon **NAEP** which is the organization that Rowe was talking about, and I got very excited when I saw that I could download data from their website. Then I did it. I was blown away. Not by the numbers, but by the weedy garden of numbers. In other words, I got a worms-eye view.

The National Report Card website offers transparency. Yeah like looking through a telescope the wrong way. What you see is a huge number of protected classes of students rigorously segregated out in an index of 96 tables. Each on has the following MadLib title in the following form

Table A-35. Percentage of \[fourth-grade\] public school students identified as \[English learners (EL)\] excluded and assessed in NAEP mathematics, \[when accommodations were permitted\] by \[urban district/jurisdiction\]: Various years, 2003–24

Here are the blanks:

- {fourth-grade, eighth-grade}
- {students with disabilities (SD), English learners (EL), }
- {when accommodations were permitted, when accommodations were not permitted}
- {urban district/jurisdiction, state/jurisdiction}

Oh by the way, those ‘various years’ are like {1992, 1996, 2000} So no not every year.

This is a transparency nightmare. This is 1996 level technology. Actually worse than that. I almost want to volunteer to get all of their data together, because there’s really not that much. But their website is just primitive. Those of you who know me know I want to help with all such data issues. I literally want to ask if they’ll pay me. We shall see. It took me 15 minutes to take a guess at which spreadsheets to download via a custom screen and another 10 minutes just to download

Here’s what I’m saying. You should be able to download the entire dataset, which cannot be more than I would guess, 200 MB and have a ***free*** full OLAP client running on your laptop and ask ***any*** question in English to an LLM that would generate SQL and automatically generate ***everything*** you wanted to know. I still don’t know what the actual numbers are. Fortunately Ian Rowe knew. For fourth graders it was between 17-25% of kids could do long division by the time they were in the fourth grade. OK? Pathetic. I’m a professional and I couldn’t get to that number from their website in an hour of digging.

This has to change.

PS. You know that I’ve been telling you that Musa al-Gharbi told me that 90% of American sociologists are only studying inequality. Now you can see materially how they publish their results.
