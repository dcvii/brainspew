The company said it entered into an agreement on Jan. 16 to invest in xAI’s Series E funding round. Tesla shareholders [had previously voted down](https://www.wsj.com/tech/tesla-xai-investment-board-vote-2fd52aea?mod=article_inline) a proposal that asked the board to invest in the startup, with more “no” votes and abstentions than “yes” votes.

SpaceX [also invested $2 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/spacex-to-invest-2-billion-into-elon-musks-xai-413934de?mod=article_inline) in xAI, a competitor to OpenAI, The Wall Street Journal reported last year.

Musk also announced the end of production for its Model S and Model X higher end vehicles, which have seen sluggish sales compared with its other EVs. Tesla will use the Model S and X factory space in Fremont, Calif., to manufacture Optimus robots, Musk said.

“There’s still obviously many who doubt our ambitions for creating amazing abundance, but we’re confident it can be done,” Musk told investors.

Tesla’s revenue fell 3% in the fourth quarter as the company [gave up its EV dominance](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-sales-drop-for-second-year-in-a-row-958dec20?mod=article_inline) to China’s [BYD](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CN/XSHE/002594) [002594 \-1.54% decrease; red down pointing triangle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CN/XSHE/002594).

Tesla reported $24.9 billion in revenue for the quarter, bringing revenue for all of 2025 to $94.8 billion, down 3% from the year before.

Free cash flow was $1.4 billion for the quarter, down 30% as Tesla invests heavily in research and development in robotics and artificial intelligence. This beat analyst consensus of negative free cash flow for the quarter.

Tesla shares rose around 1.3% in after-hours trading.

The results highlight the tough road ahead for Tesla as Musk tries to turn the focus to the company’s artificial-intelligence and [robotics strategies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-optimus-robots-7196d53e?mod=article_inline), putting the electric vehicle business on the back burner.

Tesla EV sales fell 16% during the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The company said it sold 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, a 9% drop for the full year, putting it behind BYD’s 2.26 million in EV sales last year.

Tesla’s business model will be tested over the next few months. Musk is turning his attention to expanding [Tesla’s AI capabilities](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-tesla-strategy-ai-driverless-car-97721be5?mod=article_inline), but the company still has to compete in an increasingly crowded EV market with an aging vehicle lineup and fewer government subsidies to motivate buyers.

Subscriptions of its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software increased 38% to 1.1 million, the company said. It was the first time Tesla broke out subscription numbers for the product, which the company says will, one day, make its vehicles fully autonomous.

Musk said the company still plans to start production on Cybercab, a fully autonomous two-seater with no steering wheel or pedals, in April.

“We would expect over time to make far more Cybercabs than all of our other vehicles combined,” he said. Executives also emphasized that, in the future, Tesla will have a service model, including robotaxi rides, rather than focusing on increasing vehicle sales.

In November, Tesla shareholders approved [a new pay package for Musk](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-vote-9abd5a73?mod=article_inline) that could be worth as much as $1 trillion if he meets a series of goals over a 10-year period. Tesla’s board said the expensive package is necessary to keep Musk engaged at the company as it transforms from selling EVs to focusing on AI and robotics.

The company’s sales had been in a free fall since Musk’s embrace of partisan politics in 2024, which brought protests and [worsened the company’s reputation](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-elon-musk-consumer-backlash-19326a57?mod=article_inline) in regions where Tesla was once popular, including California and Europe.

Tesla has lost market share around the globe, as it faces growing competition from carmakers in the U.S. and China.

The company’s aging vehicle lineup has frustrated some investors. In the fall, after years of hyping new low-cost models, Tesla released pared-down versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan. Despite removing features like a back row screen and an FM radio, the stripped-down cars cost $5,000 less than other models, which means they still cost more than the higher-amenity cars did when purchased with the federal tax subsidy.

In December, Tesla started testing a fully-autonomous version of its Robotaxi ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, where it currently offers Robotaxi rides with a safety driver in the passenger seat. It also offers ride hailing in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it has a person in the driver seat.
