“Tricolor auto securitization” refers to the process by which **Tricolor Holdings** (also known as Tricolor Auto Acceptance, LLC, etc.) packages up its auto loan receivables—particularly subprime or nonprime auto loans—and sells them to investors via asset-backed securities (ABS). Here’s a breakdown of what that means, how it works, and what’s going on recently:

---

## **What is Tricolor?**

- Tricolor is a used-car dealer and auto lender that focuses on people with little or no credit history, especially Hispanic and otherwise underserved consumers. 
    
- They make auto loans and then aggregate those loans into pools, which can be securitized.

## **What is securitization in this context?**

- Securitization is when a lender (originator) takes a bunch of loans (in this case, auto loans) and bundles them into a pool. That pool then becomes the collateral for securities (bonds) that are sold to investors. The income from the payments on those underlying loans flows through to the investors in the securities. 
    
- These securities are divided into **tranches** with different levels of risk and credit enhancement. Credit enhancement means various techniques (like overcollateralization, cash reserves, subordination of junior tranches, excess spread) to make sure that more senior tranches have protection from losses in the underlying pool.

## **The mechanics of a “Tricolor Auto Securitization Trust”**

- For example, **TAST 2025-1** (Tricolor Auto Securitization Trust) is one of their securitization deals. 
    
- Some stats: in TAST 2025-1, the collateral is a pool of fixed-rate auto installment loans, with a weighted average FICO score ~614, average principal per loan ~$21,381, and weighted average APR ~16.64%. 
    
- There are multiple classes (A, B, C, D, E, etc.) in each securitization, with different levels of credit enhancement. For TAST 2025-1, for example, initial credit enhancement ranged from ~44.50% for the most protected (senior) class to ~19.50% for the lowest rating class.

## **What’s new / why it’s being discussed now**

- Tricolor recently filed for **Chapter 7 bankruptcy** (September 10, 2025) in Texas. This means liquidation. 
    
- Because Tricolor is the originator _and_ servicer for many of the auto loan pools underlying its ABS, its bankruptcy (and also allegations of fraud) raises serious concerns about how well those securities will perform. 
    
- Authorities and rating agencies are especially worried about **double-pledging** (i.e. using the same collateral twice) or other misrepresentations about the underlying loans. If the underlying loans aren’t as described (or are compromised), that can reduce cash flows, increase defaults, and/or make recovery from collateral more difficult. 
    
- Rating agencies (e.g. KBRA, Moody’s) have put many of Tricolor’s ABS tranches on **watch for downgrade** given the servicer termination event implied by the bankruptcy, and concerns about operational, legal, and collateral risks.

## **Implications / Risks**

- Investors in Tricolor’s securitized auto loan ABS may face losses, particularly those in junior or lower-rated tranches that have less credit enhancement.
    
- The bankruptcy could trigger servicing transfer issues, since Tricolor may no longer be able to perform its servicing duties, which are critical for collections, repossessions, and overall asset management. 
    
- The transparency and integrity of the collateral pool is under scrutiny; investors will want to see whether loans were duplicated in pledges, whether vehicles were properly reported, etc.
    
- More broadly, this event could affect investor confidence in subprime auto ABS markets, leading to higher risk premiums, tighter terms, and more due diligence.

If you want, I can pull up a simplified example of how much risk exposure there is for various tranches in one of Tricolor’s securitizations, to show concretely what might happen.
