*Welcome back. I loved meeting some of you at the San Francisco debate, where I handed out VIP wristbands to anyone who complimented my cropped trousers—which in SF is as close as we get to shorts—or who brought a book for me to sign (any book, I just like being asked to write my name). Let’s turn to the news.*

**→ The Biden aging cover-up:** There’s a [big new book](https://amzn.to/43ne5gI) out by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson on how Biden World covered up Biden’s senility, and nuggets from it have dominated the headlines all week. Biden’s campaign staged a simple town hall to get some good clips of him talking, and he [couldn’t even muster](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/biden-town-hall-event-new-book-original-sin) coherent lines; members of Biden’s cabinet [wouldn’t see him](https://x.com/Bubblebathgirl/status/1924855829779361921) for months at a time; Hunter Biden [was effectively](https://x.com/KanekoaTheGreat/status/1924931880237031827) “the chief of staff” for the Biden family. (Commander, the German shepherd, ran our Navy.)

Biden’s deterioration was profound, was visible [as early as 2019](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5309451/biden-health-decline-original-sin), and was systematically hidden by a media that simply wanted to guzzle and regurgitate propaganda. Biden’s inner circle reportedly couldn’t believe how easily the mainstream media swallowed campaign lies, with one [anonymous insider saying](https://x.com/EWErickson/status/1925010282633449622): “We were sort of amazed at some of the stuff we were able to spin. You guys should not have believed us so easily.”

And wow, did the media fall for the Biden White House spin. They loved it!

[CNN blasted](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/24/politics/fact-check-biden-teleprompter-corden): “Fact check: Trump campaign runs ads falsely accusing Biden of using teleprompter.” The Associated Press [writes confidently](https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-9084540270): “Biden did not use teleprompter to answer reporters’ questions.” Jen Psaki [in 2021](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-biden-fitness-psaki-trouble-keeping-up): “I can tell you, having traveled with him a fair amount, sometimes he’s hard to keep up with.” Well, maybe when he’s being pushed in his chair by a younger staffer. Here’s *The* *New York Times* [in 2023](https://x.com/DrewHolden360/status/1924557948451266752/photo/3): “Yet people who deal with him regularly, including some of his adversaries, say he remains sharp and commanding in private meetings. . . . He has at times exhibited striking stamina.” Hot. He’s literally [Benson Boone](https://www.instagram.com/bensonboone/?hl=en), a virile, strapping man so fit it’s impossible for any woman to match the pace of his stride, according to the paper of record. He did a cartwheel, you just missed it. All videos showing what you *think* is a totally zonked old man are actually “[cheap fakes](https://x.com/JackPosobiec/status/1924304526737031289).” (Remember that? Real video, but bad vibes, so the media called ‘em cheap fakes.) People have collected more [greatest mainstream hits](https://x.com/DrewHolden360/status/1924946339776917804) if you like that kind of thing. [Here are all the good](https://x.com/newsbusters/status/1924851252766093462) and trusted talking heads tearing into Special Counsel Robert Hur, for example, for having the audacity to suggest Biden was pretty out of it.

Some of the book tour has been profoundly uncomfortable. Here’s Tapper: “Alex and I are here to say that conservative media was right and conservative media was correct and that there should be a lot of soul-searching, not just among me, but among the legacy media.” It’s the kind of [self-flagellation](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/05/20/tapper_conservative_media_was_right_there_should_be_soul-searching_not_just_among_me_but_among_the_legacy_media.html) that would make Opus Dei proud.

**→ Prostate cancer damage control:** A few days ahead of the book launch, [Team Biden announced](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/20/biden-cancer-sympathy-suspicion) that he had Stage 4 prostate cancer. Was it damage control? Probably. Did they think they could use it to undercut criticism? Well, maybe a little. Did it work? Let’s see.

Longtime Dem strategist David Axelrod [certainly assumed](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/18/joe-biden-prostate-cancer-00356411) it would work. He said comments related to the book about Biden’s mental acuity “should be more muted and set aside for now as he’s struggling through this.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says [it’s inappropriate](https://x.com/Breaking911/status/1924568265692418487) to ask questions about Biden’s age and health, and wondering about the timing of this announcement is *conspiratorial*: “Seems to me entirely inappropriate that at this moment in time when President Biden is dealing with a serious and aggressive form of cancer, there are Republicans who are peddling conspiracy theories.” And then Barack Obama thought it was the right moment [to announce](https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1924252774415351999) that Joe Biden is the world’s greatest scientist. He tweeted, “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe.”

Now I guess the last question to ask, and get your conspiracy flags ready and up is: How long did the White House know Biden had prostate cancer? And how much did they do to hide it? Here’s Zeke Emanuel, an oncologist and a brother of Rahm, [on MSNBC](https://x.com/WesternLensman/status/1924436167333744982) saying the obvious: “He did not develop it in the last, 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency, in 2021. I don't think there's any disagreement about that.” Can I just say (putting aside the fact that I believe in every single conspiracy here), there’s a certain indignity in being president that is so sad. He’s 80 years old, of course he has prostate cancer. All old men have prostate cancer. I assume all politicians have crazy things going on inside them and frankly I don’t need to know the details.

**→ What’s the latest, Mr. President?** And returning from a huge trip to the Middle East, President Trump, as far as regards Middle East policy goals on a 20-year time horizon and a reimagining of the JCPOA, had [this to say](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114517718765768352) on Truth Social:

“Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’ ”

**→ Did you think it meant vibes?** Someone opened fire on a group outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., [murdering two](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/shooting-dc-jewish-museum-rcna208427) young Israeli Embassy staffers, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. They were walking into an event for young professionals and the diplomatic community. While being handcuffed, our alleged new terrorist chanted “Free, Free Palestine.” Or as the mainstream media put it the next day: [agencies are](https://x.com/AshleyRindsberg/status/1925577160783536307/photo/1) “seeking a motive.”

The alleged killer, Elias Rodriguez, was apparently a longtime leftist, and a few groups have come out to laud their soldier. Unity of Fields, an “anti-imperialist propaganda front” in the new anti-Zionist movement, is already selling a [little booklet](https://x.com/unityoffields/status/1925619881795354875): *Escalate for Gaza*, *Bring the War Home*. They slapped the image of a machine gun and the name “Elias Rodriguez” to the front just in case you weren’t sure what they meant, which is kill people. Another vocal group in the “pro-Palestine” marches across New York City [posted this](https://x.com/BXAntiWar/status/1925590844343472262):

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabebbd70-26c9-46c1-9ead-5346f2046205_984x160.png)

They’re not wrong. Shooting up a Jewish museum is probably the highest expression of anti-Zionism. Unity of Fields [also mocked](https://x.com/unityoffields/status/1925589092256874822) those who condemn the killing. See, a lot of leftists wear T-shirts celebrating old-timey terrorists like [Assata Shakur](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/joanne-deborah-chesimard), but then when they see some young, hardworking terrorist out there giving it his all, they balk. And you know what, Unity of Fields? You’re totally right. If you’re gonna call yourself a Jacobin, you best be ready to operate the guillotine. Me personally, as someone these people want to kill hypothetically and literally, I’m not saying I’m in favor. I’m just saying Unity of Fields has a point about T-shirts having real meaning.

In other news, a sometime *Bloomberg* reporter [was arrested](https://freebeacon.com/campus/bloomberg-journalist-among-anti-israel-radicals-arrested-for-storming-columbia-library/) earlier this month for storming the Columbia University library as part of another anti-Zionist effort. The writer Salman Rushdie, who has the gall to not die yet, was set to give a graduation speech at Claremont McKenna but [backed out](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/05/22/salman-rushdie-graduation-speech-cancel-culture/83743117007/) amid protests and a selfish desire to keep his other eye. And a man walking around London is [just casually](https://x.com/DovForman/status/1924933515088400426) tearing off mezuzahs with a pocketknife. That’s weird!

I guess I really converted to Judaism just in time for the fun stuff. I thought I was in for jelly doughnuts and lighting candles and funny dances. But I converted just as Warsaw was getting its ghetto, right when Iraqis started looking around and saying “Hey wait, Baghdad is 25 percent Jewish?” I have one tan on a Spanish beach, and boom, King Ferdinand gets an idea. It’s perfect timing.

**→ We do not need an immigrant competition show:** The Department of Homeland Security [wants to develop](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14713113/DHS-Secretary-Kristi-Noem-reality-TV-immigrants-compete-US-citizenship.html) a reality show titled *The American*, where immigrants compete through a variety of challenges “for the honor of fast-tracking their way to U.S. citizenship.” This is real. And the challenges will be incredible: finding the rotisserie chicken aisle at Costco; binge-watching *Yellowstone* without peeing the longest; seeing how fast you can get diabetes. DHS has been working with writer and producer Rob Worsoff (supervising producer of *The Millionaire Matchmaker,* co-exec producer of *Duck Dynasty*), who, in his 35-page show proposal, said that the show will aim to “celebrate what it means to be American and have a national conversation about what it means to be American, through the eyes of the people who want it most.” It’s a *Hunger Games*. It’s a *Squid Game*. But it’s real people, trying to escape gang wars and starvation. By singing a Luke Combs song in front of a studio audience and then doing an obstacle course after eating a Big Mac. I hate myself because I know I’ll watch this.

**→ Trump-onomics:** Trump might be our first true anti-capitalist president. As Walmart works to absorb the shock of the tariffs, which might be softened but are still *a thing*, Trumpo is slamming them for [planning to raise prices](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/walmart-price-increases-trump-tariffs.html). Even though that is quite literally exactly what tariffs are meant to do. Walmart sells lots of cheap goods made in China, and the tariffs are designed to make those goods more expensive. But as Trumpo [puts it](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114523638623110397): “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!”

Speaking of economically strange decisions, the Senate [unanimously passed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/21/no-tax-on-tips-trump-senate.html) the No Tax on Tips Act. A scheme that sounds emotionally right but is in practice bizarre. Anyway, unrelated, the new cost of a *Free Press* subscription is 30 cents—the $9.70 on top of that is simply a tip.

**→ Budget cutting stumbles:** Elon spent a huge amount of political capital trying to streamline the government. Now fully 71 percent of Dems literally want him in prison (maybe Alcatraz?), according to [a Rasmussen poll this month](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/partner_surveys/71_of_democrats_want_elon_musk_in_prison), which does seem extreme. And despite it all, despite those press conferences with little X on his shoulders, [despite even Big Balls](https://nypost.com/2025/05/04/us-news/musk-brings-out-big-balls-to-explain-what-teen-does-at-doge/), government spending [is higher so far](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/data/tracking-federal-expenditures-in-real-time/) in 2025. And after Elon said last month [he’d be stepping away](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/elon-musk-doge-tesla-earnings-call) from DOGE, he [said this week](https://x.com/ElonClipsX/status/1924836602167148666?t=2055) he will be doing “a lot less” political spending. It’s the end of an era. The conservative activist Chris Rufo has [a smart essay](https://www.city-journal.org/article/elon-musk-department-of-government-efficiency-tesla-washington) on why it failed.

Meanwhile, anti-Harvard [funding cuts](https://x.com/RichardHanania/status/1923761145460212189) have been just enough to kill off a number of really good long-running studies that really have nothing to do with Hamas or DEI. There’s the study that began in 1989, investigating the causes of breast cancer; and another longitudinal study on diet and lifestyle factors affecting men’s health going back to 1986. Things such as that. You show ’em, 47!

And DOGE has had [to scale back](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/16/doge-social-security-musk-trump-cuts/) its initial efforts to cut costs and make the Social Security Administration more efficient. Why? Because Social Security is pretty efficient. So they’ve been cutting into bone. The Social Security website crashes almost every day now, and basic sad little office supplies like phone headsets are running out.

I had high hopes for DOGE and Elon, generally. As one of Elon’s wives, I’m always rooting for him. I look at my little R&KLX’s barrel chest and think, a man with these genes can’t go wrong. Call me naive, but I figured that the guy who leads Tesla and SpaceX and Starlink could make a real dent in wasteful spending, but nary a dent could be made. The bureaucracy wins again. There was a lot of trolling though! That was fun, right guys? But yeah, there were no dents. Cutting government spending is never happening in our lifetime. We now know that it is literally easier to settle Mars.

**→ Bring those old boys back:** Trump officials who were too radical a few years ago [are coming back](https://x.com/KFILE/status/1925197353536889066) with a bang.

For example, there’s John Gibbs. He’s leading policy development and research at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. His nomination for a different position failed during Trump’s first term, with senators [questioning his promotion of](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/opm-tweets-conspiracy-theory/2020/09/10/8d243ad8-f383-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html) various conspiracy theories—which senators ask about now but only to make sure you believe in them. He also once created a “think tank” called “the Society for the Critique of Feminism” (a club Bari wishes she founded while at Columbia), which argued that women should not be able to vote and blamed the “unequivocally bad” growth of the federal government on women’s suffrage. Now? Welcome, John. Vibes have shifted. When I look around the world at successful nations, it’s the ones where women can’t vote that are thriving. You might not like it, but Eritrea is what peak human performance looks like.

**→ Japan is another universe:** Japan’s agriculture minister, Taku Eto, [resigned](https://news.sky.com/story/japanese-minister-resigns-after-saying-hes-never-bought-rice-because-he-gets-it-free-13371911?dcmp=snt-sf-twitter) after saying he “never had to buy rice” and that it was always gifted to him by supporters. Amid the country’s rice shortages and rising price of the grain, the comments felt poorly timed, and there was backlash. Welp, what more can be done? “I asked myself whether it is appropriate for me to stay . . . and I concluded that it was not,” he said, and he resigned. Just like that. Imagine coming from a culture with this kind of honor code. This much self-respect. I barely understand what he did wrong. Our politicians get a 30-minute time-out for sexting the interns, and are promoted if they manage to successfully make a move. Senators get a stern no-no for doing a hit-and-run *only* if it kills someone and *only* if the body is found, otherwise a minor maiming or a disappeared wife goes without fanfare. If you send a bomb to the wrong country, you say whoopsies and just sit in a box for the next few basketball games instead of courtside. I’ll show up an hour late to a nice dinner, forget the host’s name, spill wine on the sofa, check the simmering soup and sneeze directly into it, and consider the evening a success. That’s America.

**→ Keir’s still big mad about immigration:** Keir Starmer, prime minister of the UK and the leader of the leftist Labour Party, continues his anti-immigration tirade this week. “If you work here illegally or employ people who do, we’re coming for you. Illegal working raids are up 40 percent. And we won’t stop there,” [he posted](https://x.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1924022034146705420) on X. The British people are getting riled up! I had no idea they had this much pep left. The vim and vigor! But Keir, honey, have you seen London? Places like Stratford-upon-Avon produce one child per five Hugh Grants. Sweet Keir. It’s over. Grow a beard and call it a day.

*More on the Democrats’ search for their Joe Rogan, the hackers overseeing FOIA requests, James Comey’s seashell spectacular, and more. But first: a cartoon from Mr. David Mamet:*

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F110101e2-4e29-4802-b71d-cfa9623349d4_3900x6704.jpeg)

**→ We had Joe Rogan:** At a town hall in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, earlier this month, Arizona senator Ruben Gallego [said that](https://x.com/pennslinger/status/1921344578772152732) while the left is preoccupied with needing to counter “the manosphere,” it isn’t acknowledging its own errors. “We had Joe Rogan. We canceled Joe Rogan years ago. Democrats don’t want to admit this. We did.” Truly, it is one of the great political fumbles. Rogan and also Musk, a literal green tech entrepreneur. And: RFK Jr. The left hates a winner. They hate to see a man with big biceps get too many followers. The Biden White House would [do things like](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-says-biden-administrations-ev-policy-controlled-by-unions-code-conference-2021-09-28/) gather electric vehicle makers for a White House summit but [not invite Musk](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-wasnt-invited-to-white-house-electric-cars-summit-2021-8), perhaps because Tesla’s not a union shop, and that’s his villain (Republican) origin story.

Now there’s an effort to find [the next Rogan](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/democrats-influencers-trump.html), with Democrat donors being asked to spend tens of millions of dollars to help do so. Because nothing says *hip to the kids* more than Democrat donors forming committees to find a podcaster who doesn’t offend anyone and anointing him king. I can’t wait to see who Alex Soros and Laurene Powell Jobs pick for us. A pump of Botox will be sprayed into the air, and we’ll know the Dems have found someone new. They’ll hold aloft a bag of oats. The new Joe Rogan.

**→ Klarna Karma:** Klarna, the “buy now, pay later” company that offers interest-free loans for retail purchases, [saw its losses double](https://www.ft.com/content/6c4bf393-c80b-42b7-993a-35270143f688) this past quarter to $99 million, as consumers failed to repay their loans. What are Klarna loans for? Is this a new sort of mortgage? No. Klarna gives little microloans for Apple Watches and DoorDash lunches. So people can go into debt for their fancy sandwiches. They can default over Nikes. Know that when the debt collector knocks on my door because my teenage son didn’t pay his interest on a quesadilla loan, I will hand him over immediately.

**→ FOIA has been run by actual hackers:** A government contractor tasked with running software services to process government records employed two twin brothers, Suhaib and Muneeb Akhter, both of whom had previously been convicted of . . . hacking into the State Department. Yes, [the hackers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/security-failures-behind-us-contractor-s-data-breach) were then hired by a company overseeing sensitive government data, working there for about a year until a background check led to their termination. While they were still in the process of being fired, Muneeb reportedly deleted several government databases, including one that contained FOIA request data across multiple federal agencies.

Here’s my thing: Are twins ever even permissible this high up in government? No offense, but we all know who twins look out for, and it ain’t the security of their country. It’s their built-in best buddy. Genius twins who can do hacking are a national security threat and this one is on us.

The story comes from *Bloomberg*, which leaves us ominously with this: “More than an hour after being fired, Muneeb Akhter inserted a USB drive into his laptop and removed 1,805 files of data related to a ‘custom project’ for a government agency, the cybersecurity report said. (It’s unknown what the project entailed or what the files contained.)”

**→ This is technically still illegal:** Trump’s Department of Justice opened a civil rights investigation into Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, [alleging he](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5405605/chicago-mayor-calls-doj-probe-the-trump-administrations-latest-diversity-attack) hired city employees solely because of their race, after the mayor gave a speech saying he hires solely based on race. [Here’s Mayor Johnson](https://x.com/UltraDane/status/1925331017109577949): “Detractors . . . will push back on me and say, ‘The only thing the mayor talks about is the hiring of black people.’ No, what I’m saying is, when you hire our people, we always look out for everybody else. We are the most generous people on the planet. I don't know too many cultures that have play cousins. That’s how generous we are.” He then lists all the city leaders who are black and all the reasons the black race is superior for these roles. Anyway, typical MAGA craziness going after a normal American mayor who is simply doing diversity.

**→ Oh, Comey:** James Comey earlier this month posted a photo of seashells spelling out “86 47,” with the caption “cool shell formation on my beach walk.” People quickly interpreted his post as a thinly veiled threat against Trump. He later took the post down and clarified that [he didn’t know](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70nqk9rlxpo) “86’ing” referred to anything violent.

He [later said](https://x.com/JamesAGagliano/status/1925187830348665199) that he and his wife stumbled on the shell formation, and debated its meaning: “I think it’s a clever political message. And she said, ‘You should take a picture of it.’ I said ‘sure.’ And then she said ‘You should Instagram that.’”

Wow. You would throw your wife under the bus just like that? Not very gallant-like, Mr. Comey. I used to be neutral-negative on Comey until I watched the [Martha Stewart doc](https://www.netflix.com/title/81479059), which revealed to me that he led the prosecution (and persecution) of her for her non-crime. Since then I am a full-time anti-Comey activist. 86 7. No, that is not an opaque reference to Comey because he was the seventh FBI director. Why would you even think that? Also I only said that because Bari made me. And I’m sorry but a man posting political messages via seashells? In my America, we send you to jail for that.

**→ Portland’s largest office tower goes to seed:** Poor Portland. A beautiful, cool city that didn’t have any normie lame moderates to combat their communists. Now the premier office building in downtown Portland [is for sale](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial/a-fire-sale-of-portlands-largest-office-tower-shows-how-far-the-city-has-fallen-322e0f2d?st=KGwTaj&reflink=mobilewebshare_permalink) at 80 percent below its previous value. That tower, the U.S. Bancorp Tower, currently sits half empty. Homeless people took over the empty floors, “starting fires in stairwells, smoking fentanyl and defecating in common areas.” But really: They’re just doing the work of community. It’s just not in a way you’re used to—interrogate that.

Shockingly, there are no potential buyers. And while I’m sad to read something like that, you must understand that for others, this is great news. It’s nothing short of the fall of capitalism! May the Bancorp Tower decay! May all industry around you cease and may you return to subsistence farming. The fence we build around Portland is to keep them safe (from capitalism). Sure, you’re all professional tarot card readers right now, but I know you’ll be great at scrounging for little potatoes. I’m sure you can keep sheep alive long enough to make a thin woolen sweater.

But that’s just Portland. Stepping back into the capitalist scrum we all live in, the news is actually great. Violent crime [is falling](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/05/15/violent-crime-is-falling-rapidly-across-america) nationwide. We’re actually on track to have the least murderous year since the 1960s. In heavily Democratic Pittsburgh’s mayoral primary, a moderate Dem [just defeated](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5310723-pittsburgh-mayor-ed-gainey-defeated/) the incumbent progressive mayor. Which is a problem for me because I got out of visiting my in-laws for years by claiming I couldn’t go to “commie cities” and that we’d do the holidays via Zoom. Now what am I supposed to do? Show up to freezing Pittsburgh and sound shocked when a Weiss cousin tells me how Pittsburgh has more bridges than Venice even though someone has told me that five different times? Is it [even true](https://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/does-pittsburgh-really-have-more-bridges-than-any-other-city/)? Eat another slice of the “famous almond torte” and be all “Wow, that IS light!” I don’t deserve it.

**→ I love Marie:** Moderate Washington State Democrat and perfect 10 Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez [announced that](https://x.com/RepMGP/status/1925241813352202334) she would work with a House committee to develop brightness regulations for car headlights. Because on new cars, they’re just too bright! It’s blinding! Ow! It’s dangerous for us all. Or at least, all of us who spend time online discussing car safety standards and watt overreach. As she puts it: “If you spend any time on certain subreddits, some of which have thousands and thousands and thousands of subscribers, you will know about overly bright headlights.” My heart is skipping. I’m batting my eyes. Marie, we would’ve straightened up if we knew you were coming over!

**→ Oh great, space Wuhan:** Chinese scientists discovered a [mysterious bacteria](https://nypost.com/2025/05/20/science/mysterious-bacteria-with-unique-abilities-discovered-on-chinese-space-station/) with “unique abilities” aboard their Tiangong Space Station. It’s similar to a strain of bacteria commonly found in soil, sewage, and human stool, but appears to have mutated in space. Just what we need, the Wuhan of space. Also: Leave it to China’s space station to be the one making new creations with unique abilities. The American space station bacteria is slow, lazy, and just sitting there with the Play-Doh. Sorry, I try not to write about my children here.

**→ Why must you know whether we made Covid?** [This piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html) asks the question the CCP has been waiting for:

Lab leak, no lab leak, what, do you want to marry the lab or something? Why are you stalking it? Find a hobby.

The [story calls](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html) Trump’s Covid origin info site a “conspiratorial slide deck.” That site is many things. Weird, yes. But I thought we’d moved on from calling the lab leak “a conspiracy.” So I’m honestly impressed that in the year 2025 they’re still going for this one. Our author adds that “so many eminent scientists still believe the theory is a dead end” and concludes that it’s good it was suppressed. Otherwise we might stop funding Wuhan labs or, even worse, get mad at China. We must never get mad at China. We love you, China! So I ask again: Do you have a Covid lab kink or something? A disease origin fetish? Seek professional help . . .
