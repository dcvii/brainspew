Last month, *The Free Press* and the Center for Peace Communications sent a team of journalists to south Lebanon. They were there to retrace the steps of Hadi Matar, the 27-year-old Lebanese American man [sentenced last week](https://abcnews.go.com/US/salman-rushdie-stabbing-sentencing-attempted-murder-hadi-matar/story?id=121844226) to 25 years in prison for assaulting and attempting to murder Salman Rushdie.

With Matar found guilty and behind bars, you might think most of the big questions about this case have been answered. But the story of Matar, and the issue of what motivated him to stab the British-American novelist and Booker Prize winner 15 times onstage at a literary festival in western New York in August 2022, is not over.

He faces a second trial on [federal charges](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/new-jersey-man-charged-terrorism-offenses-relating-his-attempted-murder-salman-rushdie) that he provided material support to the Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah. If found guilty, he could spend life in prison. The question of what motivated Matar, of Fairview, New Jersey, has broader ramifications. Was this attempted assassination the work of a lone wolf or was he coordinating with a foreign terror group?

That was the question at the heart of a joint investigation by *The Free Press* and the Center for Peace Communications. Our team retraced the 27-year-old’s travels to south Lebanon and his family home in the town of Yaroun, a Hezbollah stronghold on the border with Israel.

Villagers and religious leaders there provided us a dramatically different picture of Matar from the one initially painted by the Western media and U.S. law enforcement—that of a disillusioned twentysomething who hid in his mother’s basement and worked in a local clothing store. A *New Yorker* article, citing the owner of the boxing club Matar frequented, [called him](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/13/salman-rushdie-recovery-victory-city) “the definition of a lone wolf” and a *New York Post* story [referred to him](https://nypost.com/2023/02/06/salman-rushdie-breaks-silence-after-attack-i-have-ptsd-nightmares/) as “a lone-wolf Islamic fanatic.”

We were told that Matar and his father were closely associated with Hezbollah’s operatives and its affiliated mosques and religious centers in Yaroun. And Yaroun residents and religious leaders said Matar had been schooled on the importance of implementing the 1989 fatwa calling for Rushdie’s death, issued by Iran’s revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on the charge the writer blasphemed the prophet Muhammad in his novel *The Satanic Verses*.

“I know personally how close Hadi’s father and the Matar family, in general, are to Hezbollah—its political and military structure,” a Shiite religious leader in Yaroun, Sheikh Maytham Issa, told us. “I’m firmly convinced that Hadi carried out the attack on Salman Rushdie under the influence of Hezbollah’s ideology.”

Matar carried with him at the time of the attack a fake driver’s license bearing the name Hassan Mugniyah. Many villagers and leaders in Yaroun believe this was a reference to Imad Mugniyah, the Hezbollah commander who was assassinated in 2008 in [what was reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-and-mossad-killed-senior-hezbollah-figure-in-car-bombing/2015/01/30/ebb88682-968a-11e4-8005-1924ede3e54a_story.html) a joint Israel-U.S. covert operation. “Carrying an ID bearing . . . Mughniyah’s name might have been a deliberate act to leave a symbolic signature—an Iranian fingerprint—on the attack,” said Sheikh Issa.

Hezbollah’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last year in an Israeli airstrike, warned in the past that the failure of Muslims to make good on Iran’s fatwa against Rushdie has only emboldened Islam’s enemies. “If there had been a Muslim to carry out Imam Khomeini’s fatwa against the renegade Salman Rushdie, this rabble who insult our prophet Muhammad in Denmark, Norway, and France would not have dared to do so,” [Nasrallah said in 2006](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2006/2/2/muhammad-cartoon-row-goes-global).

Hezbollah seemed intent on suppressing the story of Matar’s travel to Yaroun and his links to the Iranian-backed organization. Hezbollah militiamen arrested our researchers while they were in Yaroun and destroyed many of our video recordings made there. But they couldn’t destroy our written notes.

“There is no doubt— it’s widely known—that Hadi Matar’s father is affiliated with Hezbollah,” a villager in Yaroun told us, asking that his name not be used. “By no means was he far removed from the party or its ideology.”

Hadi Matar’s father, Hassan Ali Matar, spoke to us by telephone from Yaroun. It was his first interview with the Western press, and he distanced himself from both his son’s attack and the fatwa against Rushdie. “Honestly, as a person, I’m against it,” he said. “Personally, I’m against it.” He also denied any association with Hezbollah.

The elder Matar, though, insisted that someone radicalized his son—potentially, the Iranian regime. “Absolutely, absolutely. Those who messed with his head and influenced him, for sure,” he said. “He didn’t come up with this stuff himself.”
