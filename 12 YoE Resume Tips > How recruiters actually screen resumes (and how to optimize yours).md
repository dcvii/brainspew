You‚Äôve read online that recruiters spend a few seconds on a resume.

***That‚Äôs true, but it‚Äôs not useful*** on its own.

For context, I am a former Google recruiter who now runs a resume writing service **specialized** in Software Engineering & IT.

I‚Äôm often asked about resume screening, and I've noticed many misconceptions among candidates.

So let me pull up the curtain, and take you through the ***screening process, through the eyes of a Recruiter***.

## Overview of the Hiring Process

### Your resume is reviewed several times

First, you've got to understand where the initial screen fits within the ***bigger picture***.

All hiring processes are different, but most of them somewhat resemble this:

1. Application Form
2. ATS Screening
3. ***Initial Screening***
4. Shortlisting
5. Interviews

Here‚Äôs the first thing I want you to know:

Your resume is usually reviewed ***at least twice*** before a decision to interview is made. It happens first during the ***Initial Screening (3)***, and then during the ***Shortlisting (4)***.

### All reviews are different

#### Initial Screening

The initial screen is carried out exclusively by the Recruiter.  
It‚Äôs a ***first filter*** to sort through hundreds of resumes.

The goal is to ***eliminate irrelevant CVs*** and identify those which fit requirements.

***This is why it only takes 10 seconds!***

This step is ***where most resumes get rejected***, because they are not optimized for it.

At competitive companies (think FAANG), they may end up with a list of ***20‚Äì30 candidates***, depending on the role.

#### Shortlisting

Once the recruiter has enough relevant profiles, they‚Äôll decide on a shortlist to interview.  
This is the ***second filter***, and it is usually done in collaboration with the hiring manager.

This time, your resume will be read in ***more detail*** because the goal is now to ***select the best candidates***.

Your resume usually won‚Äôt be read in its entirety, because they will still be sorting through a lengthy list. (The full review will happen as a preparation to an interview, if you are selected).

Depending on the company and role, the shortlist will usually be around ***10 candidates***.

| üèÅ Step | üéØ Goal | üëî Decision Maker | üîç Review Style | ‚è±Ô∏è Time Spent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Screening | Filter relevant CVs | Recruiter | Fast | 5‚Äì30 seconds |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ Shortlisting | Select best resumes | Recruiter + Hiring Manager | Detailed | 1‚Äì5 minutes |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ Interview | Prepare detailed questions | Hiring Manager | In-depth | 5‚Äì10 minutes |

#### Main bottleneck = your opportunity

The Pass-through Rate (% of candidates successfully passing a stage) is by far the lowest at the initial screening.

Yet most of the resumes I read aren't optimized for it, so I believe it to be the single most valuable opportunity to increase your chances.

I'll explain how to do just that, but first we need to talk about ***where recruiters spend the 5‚Äì30 seconds*** mentioned above.

## Through the eyes of a Recruiter

### Don't Make Them Think

Truth be told, recruiters usually don't like that part of their job.

They have other responsibilities, such as conducting interviews, meeting with hiring managers, analyzing hiring data, etc. All of which are more exciting than sorting through CVs.

For that reason, recruiters usually set aside dedicated time to get through as many resumes as possible and be done with it.

This is the context in which you'll be given a short amount of time, so here's an important principle:

***The easier screening your resume is, the better your outcome will be.***

### Recruiters don't read

Another key misconception is that recruiters read your resume from top to bottom.  
They don't, because it would take **too** much time and effort.

Instead, they do what you do when visiting a website: ***they rapidly skim through the content*** to identify key information.

So the key here is not to write shorter resumes, but to ***make key information obvious***.

### Easing recruiters' pain points

Here are a few low-hanging fruits that stem from this principle:

- ***Avoid fancy or unconventional designs***: if recruiters need to figure out where information is, you're out. They won't spend time trying to figure out a new clever way to organize information ;-)
- ***Layout and section titles should be predictable***: they've reviewed thousands of resumes with the same configuration, which their eyes are trained to identify without effort. Take advantage of the conventions (this is what designers do!).
- ***Use a legible font family & size***: I've seen **many** resumes using microscopic fonts so that they can cram content into a 1-page resume. If that's your case, take more space and let the content breathe.

The above points will avoid an automatic rejection, but the real selection is made based on content.

Now that the surface is scratched, let's look at the screening itself!

### What Recruiters look at

All recruiters are different, but most will look at ***3 key pieces*** of information.  
***Nail these and you‚Äôve won!***

1. Resume Title
2. Profile Summary
3. Most Recent Experience

### A Recruiter's checklist

Good recruiters don't judge resumes using their "gut feeling".

Before reviewing any CV, they'll have **defined** a clear list of requirements in collaboration with the hiring manager.

You can think of these as ***a checklist, with boxes to tick.***

The game is to figure out which these are, and provide ***obvious proof*** as ***quickly*** as possible.

#### A Story

At this point, let's use a ***fictional job opening with a scenario***:

*TimeNest is a SaaS company that helps small businesses manage their online bookings.  
They're launching a new interactive onboarding experience that lets users configure their account step-by-step, without needing to contact support (currently, they're overwhelmed!).*

Here's what the list of requirements would look like:

1. **\[Core Technical Skills\]**
	- Proficiency in ***React*** (needed for reusable components and dynamic UI updates)
2. **\[Secondary Technical Skills\]**
	- Experience with ***form libraries (React Hook Form, Formik)*** (inherent to the onboarding experience), front-end ***analytics / event tracking*** (to track user progress and drop-offs), and modern ***CSS tooling*** (for consistency across devices)
3. **\[Collaborative Skills\]**
	- Ability to work ***cross-functionally***:  
		(a) With UX/UI Designers to translate ***Figma*** designs into UI components  
		(b) With Back-end developers to integrate the front-end with ***REST APIs***
4. **\[Culture Fit\]**
	- Ability to work ***autonomously*** and take initiative (the team is small, and the environment is scrappy: there will be no hand-holding...)

## Using this senario, let's now cover all key sections. I'll explain why they are important. as well as how to optimize each of them.

## Optimize these 3 sections

### Resume Title

#### Why it matters

The first question that pops in the recruiter's head is: ***"Is this CV even relevant?"***  
Most applications are irrelevant and even ATS don't filter them all out.

If your resume includes a title, this is the first piece of information they‚Äôll read.

It should confirm that you're standing in the right line! But that's not all it can do for you...

#### Induce bias

Your resume title can be adapted to the job openings you're applying to, which is a neat psychological trick to influence a recruiter's perception without modifying your entire resume.

Doing this creates a situation of ***confirmation bias***, where recruiters instinctively look for evidence supporting the claim in your resume title.

This ensures your resume is viewed positively.

Since the resume title doesn‚Äôt have to match an official job title, you have considerable leeway to influence perception from the start.

#### What a great Resume Title looks like

Based on our example, you could write your title as:

***Front-End Software Developer | React Specialist***

Doing this not only tells them you are a front-end dev, but that you have a strong React focus.

The recruiter hasn't even read the rest of your resume, but they're already pretty sure you've got the right experience.  
Now they'll be looking to ***confirm that initial opinion***.

---

### Profile Summary

#### Why it matters

If you've included a Profile Summary, they‚Äôll read that next.

***As a Recruiter, this was my favorite section***. As a resume writer, it hasn't changed.

Here's why: a Profile Summary is the opportunity for you to ***review your own resume***.

Again, recruiters prefer making the least effort possible, so ***why not do their job for them?***

This is the only resume section that commonly ***allows for subjectivity***, which you should use to your advantage.  
You have the power to present your career in the most flattering light.

Busy recruiters will instinctively trust your assessment, until proven otherwise.

#### Juniors are no exception

I've read many times that juniors don't need a Profile Summary because their career is too short.

This is misleading, because it implies that the Profile Summary is... a summary.  
***It isn't.***

A resume isn‚Äôt literature. ***It‚Äôs sales copy.***

So your summary doesn‚Äôt serve a literary function. It's ***your key offer***.

I know that some of us are reluctant to see themselves as a product (which is why resume writing is so hard).  
However, as a job seeker you are a (human) resource in a (job) market.

Ignoring this reality leads to poor results, so it is better to accept it and write your CV accordingly.

#### What a great Profile Summary looks like

Remember ***the checklist*** we talked about? That's basically it, with all the boxes pre-ticked!

Again, using our example, here's how I would write it:

- **\[Core Technical Skills\]**  
	Junior Front-End Developer with hands-on experience building responsive, user-friendly interfaces from design to deployment, leveraging core ***UI/UX principles*** and ***front-end performance*** best practices.
- **\[Core + Secondary Technical Skills\]**  
	Expansive technical skill set with a strong focus on the ***React ecosystem***, including React, ***React Hook Form, Context API, and Redux***. Experienced managing complex form state, and developing modular, reusable components using Tailwind CSS.
- **\[Collaborative Skills\]**  
	Enthusiastic collaborator, partnering with ***UI/UX designers*** to translate ***Figma / Adobe XD*** prototypes into front-end code and working with ***back-end developers*** to integrate components with ***RESTful APIs***, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience.
- **\[Culture Fit\]**  
	***Autonomous*** and self-driven individual able to solve issues with minimum supervision, while navigating ***uncertainty, complexity, and change*** within rapidly evolving environments.

Think of the recruiter reading this: they've skimmed through ***4 sentences, which describe exactly what they're after.***

If you can do this effectively, their decision is made at 95% already. ***Before reading anything else.***

---

### Most Recent Job

Recruiters want a clear idea of ***the best you have to offer***.

To speak in marketing terms again, this is your ***core product.***

This would usually be the most senior position you've held to date, with the widest scope and most complex deliveries.

If you don't have work experience yet, you should position your most recent project here. Treat it as a job: write it in the same level of detail you would a paid experience.

#### Go deep

Most of the time spent on work experience will be allocated to that most recent job.

For that reason, this job block should ***address most of a job description's requirements*** and target as many areas of the job profile as possible.

This means the job block will be ***longer than any other***: that's absolutely fine!

#### Write an introductory bullet

If the screening is on the shorter end of the spectrum, it's possible that only the first bullet point is read.

Because of this, you should include an ***introductory bullet point*** that will give a complete overview of your role.

That first bullet point should address:

1. Product/Software/Company type
2. Role scope
3. Key challenges
4. Key achievements

#### What a great Job Block looks like

So that this post doesn't get too long, I'm not going to write a full job block here.

Instead, I'll write the ***first introductory bullet point***, and list the ***key areas of contributions*** that should be addressed.

To learn ***how to write great bullet points***, you can refer to ***my post*** on the topic here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1jd9qzl/12\_yoe\_resume\_tips\_write\_your\_resume\_bullet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1jd9qzl/12_yoe_resume_tips_write_your_resume_bullet/)

I'll write another post soon about ***role profiles*** (how to know what to write about for a specific position), which I will link here when ready :-)

- **(1) \[Introduction\]**  
	Brought product vision to life, by designing intuitive user experiences for a ***multi-step account setup interface*** in a B2B payroll automation platform, addressing ***complex form logic*** and responsiveness while building accessible, component-driven UIs within the ***React ecosystem***.
- **(2) \[Cross-functional collaboration\]**
- **(3) \[UI Design / Prototyping / Design Principles\]**
- **(4) \[Components Design with React / State Management\]**
- **(5) \[Front-End Performance & Analytics\]**
- **(6) \[UI Testing\]**
- **(7) \[Security\]**
- **(8) \[Accessibility\]**
- **(9) \[Team Support / Leadership Initiatives\]**

(1) The introductory bullet point shows that you've worked for a ***similar product*** and solved ***similar challenges***, while using the ***same tech stack*** they are using.

This is of course an ideal case, which won't always be reality, but you should focus on highlighting aspects that fit requirements.

(2) ‚Äì (5) Address the key requirements from the ***checklist***.

(6) ‚Äì (9) Are secondary requirements for a Front-End role. They often won't be listed in job descriptions, nor will they be addressed in resumes.

This is however an opportunity you shouldn't miss: it's a great way for you to ***differentiate yourself*** from all the other candidates who will also meet the main requirements.

To a recruiter, that's the icing on the cake: be generous :-)

### Other Sections

Though the rest of your work experience will only be given a quick glance during the Initial Screening, 2 other sections may have a small weight in the balance.

#### Education

***If you are a junior***, they may use your graduation date as a way to assess the actual length of your work experience.

You'll be at an advantage if you have a University Degree (rather than a Bootcamp), so you should provide the full information instead of keeping them guessing.

***For seniors***, Education won't be given much importance.

#### Technical Skills

Technical Skills may also hurt you if not present, because recruiters want to know your tech stack.

Using different tools is not a deal-breaker, but you‚Äôll score extra points if you use the same technologies as their team.

---

### Best sections order

When I write a resume, I ensure all the above information is visible on the first page. This makes it extremely easy for the recruiter, increasing your chances.

Here‚Äôs the order I recommend:

1. Personal Information with Resume Title
2. Profile Summary
3. Technical Skills
4. Education
5. Work Experience (most recent job first)

***For seniors, place the Education section at the end*** of your resume.

The rest of your work experience can go on page two.

---

## Conclusion

By following the above principles, you'll improve your chances during that Initial Screening.

It's however important to note that this is not all you need to worry about when it comes to resume writing.

As mentioned above, your resume is reviewed several times, and with each review comes a set of optimizations.

These are beyond the scope of this post, which I wanted to focus on the few things you can do to improve your results quickly.

If you want to learn more about the other stages of the process, let me know and I'll happily write about these too :-)

Thank you so much for taking the time to read me and please don't hesitate to ask questions!
