### Are we comparing apples with pears?

I saw this exam copy from 1912 on social media, along with comments suggesting that the exam better prepared students for life after school compared to tests for eighth graders today. Some comments even argue that students in 1912 were more challenged than they are now, given that they could pass such rigorous tests!

The 1912 eighth-grade examination from Bullitt County Schools in Kentucky clearly provides a fascinating window into the educational expectations of early 20th-century America. Comparing this exam with the content taught to eighth graders in 2024 reveals a striking shift in focus, content, and the nature of what we expect students to know at the age of 13 or 14.

The 1912 exam tests a broad array of subjects, including spelling, reading, arithmetic, geography, physiology, civil government, and history. The questions are largely factual, requiring rote memorization and the ability to recall specific information. For instance, in geography, students were expected to know detailed locations of cities, bodies of water, and the relationships between various geographic features. The arithmetic section required not only fluency in simple math but also applied problem-solving skills involving concepts like percentages and practical applications related to construction and farming. Spelling involved words like "chandelier," "scissors," and "conceive," which indicate a strong emphasis on vocabulary building.

In contrast, the 2024 curriculum for eighth graders focuses on critical thinking, problem-solving, and the application of concepts rather than pure memorization. Modern eighth-grade assessments tend to incorporate multiple-choice questions, data interpretation, and critical analysis tasks, emphasizing skills over the retention of facts. For instance, geography in 2024 often includes understanding climate change impacts, human migration, and data analysis using technology. Students are less often asked to memorize the names of specific rivers or capitals and more often expected to understand broader concepts, such as the implications of geographic features on human civilization.

One striking comparison is in the approach to government and civics. In 1912, students were asked straightforward questions like defining types of government or knowing the branches of the U.S. government and their duties. In 2024, eighth-grade civics education still covers these foundational facts, but it also asks students to engage with the material on a deeper level, such as evaluating how governmental policies affect citizens or discussing the role of social movements in shaping democracy. **Modern education encourages students to think about how governance impacts everyday life, fostering a more critical understanding of civic responsibilities.** At least that is my interpretation of how 2024 teaching should be.

**Practical for the time**

The content of the 1912 exam also suggests a certain level of familiarity with daily tasks that were practical for that era. Arithmetic questions on calculating the cost of fencing a field or determining the worth of a man’s labor clearly reflect a rural, agricultural society. Today, math education for eighth graders often includes a mix of algebra, statistics, and geometry, with an emphasis on abstract reasoning rather than practical, task-based calculations. Students in 2024 might be asked to model a scenario using equations or interpret graphs and datasets, reflecting a shift towards preparation for a world increasingly shaped by technology and data.

Another difference worth noting is the nature of language education. Grammar and spelling formed a significant part of the 1912 exam, with an emphasis on parsing sentences, defining parts of speech, and changing the voice of verbs. The focus was on precision in language use, likely reflecting the importance of effective communication in an era before widespread telecommunication. Today, language arts education tends to focus more on reading comprehension, thematic analysis of texts, and creative expression. Eighth graders might analyze the symbolism in a novel or write an argumentative essay, honing their ability to articulate thoughts rather than simply memorize grammatical rules.

The differences between the 1912 exam and modern assessments reflect broader changes in society. In 1912, the emphasis was on practical skills and knowledge that directly applied to the daily life of an agrarian society. Students were expected to be capable of contributing to family businesses, understand basic civic duties, and navigate the practicalities of the world around them. Today, education has shifted towards preparing students for a future in a highly interconnected and technologically advanced society. The emphasis is on adaptability, problem-solving, and the ability to navigate an information-rich environment.

**Romanticizing the past - or are we truly wrong today?**

While it might be easy to romanticize the rigor of early 20th-century education based on this exam, it's important to recognize that the educational system of 1912 served a very different purpose compared to today’s system. The 1912 exam prioritized foundational, concrete knowledge, preparing students for the immediate demands of adult life in a largely localized, labor-intensive world. In contrast, the 2024 education system aims to equip students with the skills needed for a global, ever-changing job market, emphasizing critical thinking, creativity, and technological literacy.

I know this is a relatively simplified comparison, yet it highlights not only the evolution of educational content but also the evolution of our expectations for what knowledge and skills are deemed most important for young people to acquire. The 1912 eighth-grade examination provides a snapshot of a world where knowing how to calculate the number of steps required to walk a given distance was vital, while today’s education system is focused on understanding complex systems, engaging with diverse perspectives, and preparing students for overcoming the challenges of tomorrow.

I’m not a fan of rote learning, but I also question are we teaching the right things (and way) today.

**This all being said - I would expect an 8th grader of 2024 to pass the 1912 test. Look at the questions, they are nothing untoward, not rocket science.**
