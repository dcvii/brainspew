Gerrymanders we always have with us, but sometimes they boomerang in unexpected ways. Consider how Texas Republicans are exploiting a Democratic lawsuit and the Voting Rights Act to pad their chances of retaining their House majority in 2026.

To protect its House control, President Trump is demanding that Republicans redraw Congressional maps in GOP-led states to their advantage. “Texas will be the biggest one. And that’ll be five,” Mr. Trump said last week. With nips and tucks to Texas’s 38 districts, Republicans can pick up five seats.

States rarely redraw maps mid-decade unless ordered by the courts. But the Trump Justice Department gave Texas Republicans an excuse when it warned in a letter this month that several House districts “constitute unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” More on that word “racial” below. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott then called a special legislative session that started Monday to redraw the map.

Democrats are understandably furious. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of “conspiring to rig the Texas congressional map as part of an effort to disenfranchise millions of people in Texas.” Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to have his Legislature redraw California’s already heavily gerrymandered map to further help Democrats.

#### \*\*\*

Herein lies a lesson in how the 1965 Voting Rights Act has become a partisan tool that no longer serves its original purpose. Texas picked up two House seats in the 2020 reapportionment. GOP lawmakers redrew the map to protect their incumbents and ensure Republicans represent the two new districts, giving them 25 of the state’s 38 seats.

Liberal groups and the Biden Justice Department in 2021 challenged the map under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The law says states violate the voting rights of racial minorities when they “have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.”

The Supreme Court has said this means states can’t dilute minority votes when they draw maps. Yet its muddled *Gingles* (1986) test for proving vote dilution has created opportunities to use lawsuits to force states to redraw maps for partisan advantage.

Texas is a case in point. The liberal plaintiffs claim the GOP’s Texas map dilutes Hispanic voters by spreading them across predominantly white districts that favor Republicans while concentrating Hispanics in districts that are safely Democratic. This allegedly reduces Hispanics’ opportunity to “elect representatives of their choice.” The liberal plaintiffs want Texas to draw more majority-minority districts with the expectation that they would favor Democrats. A federal court heard their lawsuit in May.

To prove vote dilution under *Gingles*, plaintiffs must show a minority group is large, compact and politically cohesive to constitute a majority-minority district and that whites vote “sufficiently as a group” to defeat a minority’s preferred candidate. It’s unclear how this test applies to Texas in America’s melting pot.

Hispanics make up a small plurality of Texas’s population. Under the *Gingles* framework, shouldn’t the question be whether white votes are diluted since they’re now a minority? It’s also hard for the plaintiffs to argue that Hispanic voters in Texas are a politically cohesive group given they favored Mr. Trump 55% to 45% in last year’s election.

Two of the state’s existing Hispanic-majority districts are represented by Republicans—Tony Gonzales and Monica De La Cruz—who are racial minorities. The Biden DOJ argued, bizarrely, that “bloc voting by Anglo voters will enable them to usually defeat Latino voters’ preferred candidates” in the district that Mr. Gonzales represents.

#### \*\*\*

All of this underscores *Gingles* and its basis in Section 2 are outdated vestiges of the Jim Crow era that no longer make sense in our diverse country. Section 2 was intended to protect minority voters from being disenfranchised, and majority-minority districts were fashioned to remedy discrimination.

But as Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted in *Allen v. Milligan* (2023),“the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.” He reiterated this in oral argument in the spring when the Court heard a challenge by white voters to Louisiana’s map that strained to create two majority-black districts *(Louisiana v. Callais*).

The Court punted on deciding the Louisiana case and will rehear arguments this next term. Citing Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence in its letter to Texas, the Trump DOJ seems to be urging the Justices to overturn *Gingles* and rule definitively that states can’t consider race in map-making. The bipartisan political machinations in Texas suggest it’s time for the Court to take up that offer.
