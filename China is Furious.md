How the U.S. Deleted China From South America.

China is furious.

Maduro is gone.

And the media completely missed what actually happened.

This wasn’t about “international law” or “sovereignty.”

It was real power, applied in real time.

In this video, I break down how the U.S. dismantled China’s strategic foothold in Venezuela, voided Beijing’s oil and loan contracts overnight, and reminded the world what the Monroe Doctrine looks like when it’s enforced.

From China’s reflexive defense of dictators, to America’s cold realpolitik, to why Chinese weapons collapse under real pressure—this was a strategic defeat for Beijing, not a talking-point.

Beijing issues statements.

Washington moves carriers.

That’s the difference.

Watching the captured Maduro paraded through the streets of New York was oddly familiar. It immediately brought to mind the Chinese communist’s own greatest hits during the pandemic—storming into people’s homes, dragging them out in the middle of the night, and stuffing them into

Appreciate you Ken. The illegality of the move by the U.S. Administration is still a sticking, sore point. It sets a very bad precedence. We will see how this plays out. I hope the people of Venezuela regain the successes and wealth that it once had in the past, collectively.

The United States remains the architect and enforcer of the post–World War II order. In great-power politics, military power and national interest always override legal and moral abstractions.

The Monroe Doctrine is 2 things: we won’t interfere in European affairs, and we won’t allow them to interfere in ours—doesn’t even apply in this scenario—I’m pretty good at geography, and China is nowhere near Europe, last time I checked

And who else stands with Maduro? The New York Times and the traditional media propaganda machine. Just goes to show whose side they are really on.
