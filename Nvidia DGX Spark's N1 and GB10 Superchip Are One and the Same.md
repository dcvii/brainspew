Although the unlikely matchup between Intel and Nvidia has the [spotlight](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/nvidia-and-intel-to-develop-ai-infrastructure-pc-products-together) this week, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang also delivered some interesting news about its ARM-based home "supercomputer." That would be the DGX Spark and DGX Station, two flavors of the AI PC coming from mainstream PC builders. As [Videocardz](https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-ceo-confirms-n1-chip-is-actually-gb10-superchip-used-in-dgx-spark) points out, the N1 ARM chip is going into the DGX Spark, meaning that the N1 ARM chip and the Grace Blackwell GB10 "Superchip" appear to be the same.

It's worth repeating that Huang mentioned the ARM-based chip—part of a collaboration with MediaTek—during a Q&A for the Intel/Nvidia press conference. The event centered around plans for SoCs that feature Nvidia GPU chiplets and Intel x86 CPU cores, but Huang took the opportunity to call out its DGX Spark project and make clear that Nvidia isn't dropping one for the other.

"We also have a new ARM product that's called the N1," Huang said at the Q&A. "That processor is going to go into the DGX Spark and many other versions of products like that. And so we're super excited about the ARM road map, and this doesn't affect any of that."

Nvidia announced Project DIGITs at CES in January and pointed to the GB10 chip as the driving force behind the upcoming devices. Since then, Acer and others have said they are building Project Digits computers. As Tom's Hardware [points out](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/acer-unveils-project-digits-supercomputer-featuring-nvidias-gb10-superchip-with-128gb-of-lpddr5x), the Acer Veriton GN100, a mini AI workstation, is on the way, with an expected price of $3,999 and a GB10 superchip inside.

The GB10 has 20 CPU cores and (importantly for AI tasks) 128GB of LPDDR5x memory, at least in the upcoming DGX Spark. That system, which will provide up to a petaflop AI horsepower for home users, pales in comparison to the [DGX Station](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-ai-first-dgx-personal-computing-systems-with-global-computer-makers), which should handle up to 20 petaflops, thanks to 784GB of memory. The DGX Spark isn't meant for gaming, so keep that in mind when you're eyeballing it for your home.

Nvidia's collaboration with MediaTek doesn't appear to be going anywhere, and Nvidia's new partnership with Intel has the potential to make for a very broad range of products as Nvidia competes with AMD for AI dominance in both the consumer and corporate arenas. The new Intel x86/Nvidia GPU chips, which TechPowerUp calls x86 RTX SoCs, will likely appear in a range of portable consumer PCs, including laptops, handheld gaming devices, and other systems.
