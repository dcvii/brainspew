What actually happened with Net Neutrality? Who predicted correctly?

Net neutrality refers to the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all online data equally—no blocking, throttling (slowing), or prioritizing certain content for payment—without discrimination based on source, type, or destination.Here's a timeline of what actually happened in the US:
- 2015: Under the Obama administration and FCC Chair Tom Wheeler, the FCC adopted strong net neutrality rules via the Open Internet Order. It reclassified broadband ISPs as Title II common carriers (like utilities), banning blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization, while allowing reasonable network management.
- 2017: Under the Trump administration and FCC Chair Ajit Pai (a former Verizon lawyer and longtime critic), the FCC voted 3–2 along party lines to repeal those rules (effective June 2018). Broadband was reclassified back to lighter Title I "information service" regulation. Pai argued the 2015 rules were unnecessary, stifled investment/innovation, and that the internet wasn't "broken" before them. Critics (including consumer groups, tech companies like Google/Netflix, and figures like John Oliver) warned it would let ISPs create fast/slow lanes, harm competition/innovation, and enable censorship or exploitation.
- 2018–2023: After repeal, no widespread "doomsday" scenarios emerged—no massive blocking of sites, no obvious paid prioritization harming consumers, and broadband investment continued (though debates exist on whether it was suppressed or boosted). Some states (e.g., California, New York) passed their own net neutrality laws to fill the federal gap.
- 2024: Under the Biden administration and Democratic-led FCC (Chair Jessica Rosenworcel), the FCC voted 3–2 to reinstate net neutrality rules, again via Title II reclassification, prohibiting blocking/throttling/paid prioritization and adding transparency.
- 2025: In January 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit struck down the reinstatement. The ruling cited the Supreme Court's 2024 Loper Bright decision (overturning Chevron deference, which previously let agencies interpret ambiguous laws). The court held the FCC lacked authority to reclassify broadband as Title II without clearer statutory backing—reaffirming ISPs as Title I services. This ended federal net neutrality mandates again. Some state laws remain in effect, but no national standard exists. FCC Chair Rosenworcel called for Congress to enact permanent legislation.
As of February 2026, there is no federal net neutrality enforcement. The issue ping-pongs with administrations and now faces steeper legal hurdles post-Chevron overturn.Who predicted correctly?It's nuanced—neither side's most extreme predictions fully materialized, but the debate continues:
- Ajit Pai and repeal supporters (e.g., many Republicans, ISP industry groups like CTIA/USTelecom) predicted correctly that repeal wouldn't "break" or "kill" the internet. Post-2018, there were no widespread consumer-harming abuses like site blocking or aggressive paid prioritization schemes. Investment in networks held up or grew in many metrics, and the sky didn't fall as some critics claimed. Pai often said apocalyptic warnings were overblown—and time largely bore that out during the repeal period.
- Net neutrality proponents (consumer advocates like Free Press/Consumers Union, many Democrats, tech firms, and activists) were right that repeal left ISPs freer to potentially discriminate, and that federal protections were vulnerable to partisan flips and court challenges. They highlighted past incidents (e.g., Comcast throttling BitTorrent in 2007–2008) as evidence of risk without rules. While major abuses didn't surge post-2017, the lack of federal oversight meant consumers relied on market competition (often limited) or FTC/state action. The quick 2024 reinstatement attempt—and its 2025 overturn—validated concerns about instability and ISP power in a lightly regulated environment.
In short: The repeal side was more accurate on short-to-medium-term outcomes (no internet apocalypse after 2018), while proponents were more accurate on long-term risks (partisan reversals, legal fragility, and potential for future ISP abuses without strong federal rules). The fight ultimately shifted to Congress for a permanent fix, as courts have increasingly limited FCC authority.

Did Congress come up with a permanent fix? Are there any bills pending?

No, Congress has not enacted a permanent fix for net neutrality as of February 20, 2026. The issue remains unresolved at the federal level following the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's January 2025 ruling (which vacated the FCC's 2024 reinstatement of net neutrality rules under Title II reclassification, relying on the Supreme Court's 2024 Loper Bright decision ending Chevron deference). This has left broadband as a lightly regulated "information service" without nationwide net neutrality mandates, though some state-level protections (e.g., in California, New York) continue where they haven't been preempted or challenged.The ruling emphasized that the Communications Act does not clearly authorize the FCC to impose such rules, shifting the burden to Congress for any lasting statutory solution. No major bipartisan or comprehensive legislation has passed to codify net neutrality principles permanently (e.g., banning blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization) or to explicitly limit/expand FCC authority.Pending or Recent Legislative Activity
- There are no active, high-profile federal bills specifically aimed at restoring or permanently establishing net neutrality that appear to be advancing toward passage in the current (119th) Congress.
- Historical efforts (e.g., the Save the Internet Act in prior sessions) failed to become law, often due to partisan divides—Democrats generally favor strong rules, while Republicans and industry groups prefer deregulation.
- Some indirect or related activity exists:
	- State-level urgings: For example, New Jersey's Assembly Resolution 52 (AR52), introduced in January 2026, urges the President and Congress to restore net neutrality in federal law. It's a non-binding resolution and doesn't create law but reflects ongoing state pressure on Congress.
	- Broader broadband/telecom bills: Congress has focused on related issues like universal service fund reforms, rural broadband deployment (e.g., BEAD program oversight), spectrum, or network equipment transparency (e.g., S.503 NET Act), but none directly address net neutrality as a core provision.
	- Opinion pieces and advocacy (from 2025 onward) call for congressional action to create a "new standard" or bipartisan compromise, but no such bill has gained traction or been reported out of committee.
- Wikipedia and other summaries note repeated failed attempts by Congress to legislate on this, with the post-2025 landscape showing deregulation as the effective status quo unless lawmakers intervene.
In practice, the ping-ponging between FCC rules (tied to administrations) has largely ended due to judicial limits on agency authority. Any permanent fix would require new legislation from Congress, but political gridlock, industry lobbying (favoring the status quo), and competing priorities (e.g., debt, appropriations) have prevented it so far. Consumer advocates continue pushing, while opponents argue the internet functions well without federal mandates. The situation could shift with future elections or crises, but nothing has materialized yet in 2026.

What materially do ISP providers in California and NY which is special in complaince with their state regulations?

Net neutrality and related broadband regulations vary by state, especially in the absence of federal mandates following the 2025 Sixth Circuit court ruling. Below, I'll outline the key state-specific regulations in California and New York that impose unique compliance requirements on internet service providers (ISPs). These are "special" in that they go beyond the current federal baseline (light Title I regulation with no nationwide net neutrality or price controls). I'll focus on material actions ISPs must take to comply, based on enacted laws as of February 20, 2026. Note that pending bills (e.g., New York's proposed S6066 for broader net neutrality) are not yet law and thus not enforceable.California: Net Neutrality and Consumer Protection Rules California's Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018 (SB-822) remains in full effect, upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 and unaffected by recent federal rulings. This law applies to all ISPs serving California customers and is more stringent than the repealed 2015 federal rules. It prohibits discriminatory practices and requires transparency. Material compliance actions ISPs must undertake include:
- Prohibiting Blocking and Throttling: ISPs cannot block access to lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices. They also cannot impair or degrade (throttle) lawful internet traffic based on content, application, or source. To comply, ISPs must configure their network management systems to treat all data equally, avoiding algorithms or policies that slow specific sites or apps (e.g., no throttling of streaming services like Netflix unless for neutral network management reasons).
- Banning Paid Prioritization: ISPs are forbidden from creating "fast lanes" where content providers pay for faster delivery. This means no agreements with companies (e.g., Google or Amazon) for preferential treatment. Compliance involves auditing contracts and ensuring routing protocols don't favor paid traffic.
- Restrictions on Zero-Rating and Sponsored Data: Certain zero-rating programs (where data for specific apps doesn't count against caps) are illegal if they discriminate by excluding or favoring content. For example, an ISP can't zero-rate its own video service while charging for competitors'. ISPs must review and modify data plans to ensure neutrality, potentially eliminating or redesigning such offerings.

- Transparency and Disclosure: ISPs must publicly disclose network management practices, including any congestion management or data caps, via websites or customer notices. This requires maintaining updated compliance documentation and responding to California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) inquiries.
- Reporting and Oversight: Starting January 1, 2027, under the recently enacted AB-353 (2025-2026 session), ISPs must annually report to the California Department of Technology on affordable home internet services, including availability and adoption rates. Additionally, for state-subsidized programs like California LifeLine (broadband subsidies), participating ISPs must adhere to eligibility verification and non-discrimination rules enforced by the CPUC.
	[docs.cpuc.ca.gov](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M596/K281/596281074.docx)
These requirements materially force ISPs to invest in neutral network infrastructure, conduct internal audits, and forgo revenue streams like paid prioritization. Non-compliance can lead to CPUC fines or lawsuits. Note that federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grants may be withheld if states enforce such rules, but California has proceeded independently.

New York: Affordable Broadband Act (ABA) and Limited Net Neutrality Measures New York does not have a comprehensive net neutrality law mandating no-blocking/no-throttling for all ISPs (proposed bills like S6066 and A7126, which would limit state contracts to net-neutral ISPs, remain pending as of February 20, 2026). Instead, the state's standout regulation is the Affordable Broadband Act (ABA), enacted in 2021 and fully enforced starting January 2025 after surviving U.S. Supreme Court challenges. This applies to ISPs with over 20,000 subscribers in the state and focuses on price accessibility for low-income households rather than content neutrality. Material compliance actions include:
- Offering Low-Cost Plans: ISPs must provide at least one of two options to eligible low-income customers: $15/month for 25 Mbps download speeds or $20/month for 200 Mbps. These plans must match the quality and terms of standard offerings (e.g., no inferior equipment or hidden fees). To comply, ISPs update pricing structures, billing systems, and service catalogs to include these tiers.
- Eligibility Verification: ISPs verify customer eligibility using federal tools like the National Verifier (for programs such as SNAP, Medicaid, or free school lunch) or state-approved documentation. This requires integrating verification APIs, training customer service staff, and maintaining secure data-handling processes to avoid privacy violations.
- Marketing and Promotion: ISPs must actively promote these plans through websites, bills, ads, and customer communications. Compliance involves creating marketing materials, tracking outreach efforts, and ensuring accessibility (e.g., multilingual support).
- Annual Reporting: By November 15 annually (starting 2025), ISPs submit to the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) descriptions of their verification processes and marketing strategies. This necessitates internal reporting systems and data collection on plan adoption.
- Limited Net Neutrality via Contracts: Under executive orders and pending bills (e.g., S6066), state agencies can only contract with ISPs that self-certify compliance with net neutrality principles (no blocking/throttling/paid prioritization). For affected ISPs, this means providing certifications and potentially adjusting practices for government clients, though it's not statewide for all customers.
These ABA requirements materially compel ISPs to subsidize low-income access, potentially at a loss, and invest in administrative systems for verification and reporting. Non-compliance risks PSC penalties or loss of state business. Similar to California, BEAD funding may require exemptions from these price regs, creating tensions for grant recipients.

Other NY regs (e.g., under the PSC for utility poles or broadband mapping) are more general and not uniquely "special" compared to other states.In summary, California's regulations emphasize content neutrality, forcing ISPs to maintain equal treatment of data, while New York's focus on affordability mandates discounted plans and outreach. Both states' rules have inspired similar efforts elsewhere (e.g., in Vermont and Massachusetts), but federal pushback on grants could limit their expansion.

What actions, if any, in violation of these particular state regulations have been brought? What is the net differential in pricing for ISP services in these two states vs those with the looser regulations?

Enforcement Actions for Violations of State Regulations As of February 20, 2026, there have been no major enforcement actions, fines, or lawsuits brought against ISPs for direct violations of California's net neutrality law (SB-822) or New York's Affordable Broadband Act (ABA). Both laws have faced significant legal challenges to their validity rather than enforcement for non-compliance, and they are relatively mature (CA since 2018, NY fully enforced since January 2025). Below is a breakdown based on available records from state agencies, court cases, and news reports:California (SB-822: Net Neutrality Act)
- The law prohibits blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and certain zero-rating practices. While it has been in effect since 2021 (after surviving federal preemption challenges), no ISPs have been formally cited or penalized for violations.
- Key historical context includes industry challenges (e.g., ACA Connects v. Bonta in 2022, upheld by the Ninth Circuit, affirming the law's enforceability).
	[congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB10693)
	The U.S. Department of Justice initially sued to block it in 2018 but dropped the case in 2021.
	[justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-files-net-neutrality-lawsuit-against-state-california-0)
- One notable concern (not a formal violation) arose in 2021 regarding zero-rating for the VA Video Connect telehealth app, where ISPs and the VA worried it might breach the ban on discriminatory data exemptions. This led to discussions with the California Attorney General's office, but no enforcement action resulted; instead, clarifications or case-by-case exemptions were suggested for public interest services. No further issues have been reported in 2023–2026.
- The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) oversees compliance, but public records show no complaints escalating to formal actions. Consumer advocates have noted minor grievances (e.g., potential throttling complaints), but these were resolved informally without penalties.
New York (Affordable Broadband Act)
- The ABA requires ISPs with over 20,000 subscribers to offer low-cost plans ($15/month for 25 Mbps or $20/month for 200 Mbps) to eligible low-income households, with verification and reporting mandates. Full enforcement began on January 15, 2025, after the Second Circuit upheld it in April 2024 and the U.S. Supreme Court declined review in December 2024 and February 2025.
- No violations have been reported or enforced yet, likely due to the recent start date. The New York Public Service Commission (PSC) handles oversight, requiring annual reports on verification and marketing, but no non-compliance cases have been publicized in 2025–2026.
- Industry groups challenged the law's constitutionality (e.g., New York State Telecommunications Association v. James), but these were about preemption, not ISP violations. ISPs have complied by offering the required plans, with no fines or actions noted.
In both states, the focus has been on defending the laws in court rather than prosecuting violations. Future actions could emerge as oversight matures, especially for NY's newer enforcement.Net Differential in ISP Pricing: California and New York vs. States with Looser Regulations To assess the "net differential" (difference in average monthly broadband prices), I compared California and New York (with stricter state regs) to states like Texas and Florida (no state-level net neutrality or price mandates, relying on federal Title I deregulation) and the national average. Data is drawn from 2025–2026 reports, focusing on average household bills for fixed broadband (cable, fiber, DSL; excluding mobile or satellite). Prices reflect advertised rates, not including taxes, fees, or promotions, and vary by speed tiers (typically 100–500 Mbps for comparability).Key caveats:
- Pricing is influenced more by urban density, competition, infrastructure (e.g., fiber availability), and inflation than regulations alone. Studies show mixed regulatory impacts: stricter rules may add compliance costs (potentially +5–10%), but they can also promote competition and lower prices long-term.
	[benton.org](https://www.benton.org/blog/broadband-prices-increased-2025)
- National average monthly price: $70–80 (e.g., $74.17 in late 2024 reports, rising to ~$77 by 2025 due to 2–3% annual increases).
- Value often measured in $/Mbps (lower = better value). National median speed: ~150 Mbps.
Average Monthly Prices and Differentials (2025–2026 Data)

| State |  |  |  |  | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | $80–90 | 224 | $0.84 | +$3–13 |  |
|  | $96 |  | $0.80–0.90 | +$19 |  |
|  | $75–85 | 226 |  |  |  |
|  | $83 | 233 | $0.72 | +$6 |  |
| National Average | $77 | 150–200 | $0.45–0.80 | N/A |  |

- Net Differential Summary: Stricter states (CA/NY) show a +$10–20/month premium vs. looser states (TX/FL) or national average, potentially attributable to regulatory compliance (e.g., transparency/reporting costs in CA, subsidized plans in NY). However, differences are small and confounded by factors like population density (higher in NY/CA) and fiber penetration (better value in TX/CA). No direct causal link from regs to higher prices is substantiated in recent data; prices rose nationally by ~3% in 2025 regardless of state rules.
