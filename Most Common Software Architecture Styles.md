Software **architecture styles** are the foundational blueprints for constructing various software systems, ensuring they meet specific requirements and quality attributes. By adhering to a suitable architecture style, organizations can ensure that their software systems are built to align with their strategic goals, accommodate future changes, and are resilient in the face of evolving technological landscapes and user demands.

An **architectural pattern**, on the other hand, communicates a fundamental organizational structure for software systems. By selecting the appropriate patterns for your issue, you can avoid creating anything from scratch and potentially dangerous traps that might arise if you devise a novel solution.

Most common software architecture styles

Here are the most common architectural styles:

1. ==**Monolithic**==**:** Builds the entire application as a single unit, where all functionalities and components are managed and served from one place. Examples of monolithic architectures are **Onion** and **Layered**.

> **Pros:** simple to implement, enhanced maintainability, as issues or updates can be addressed in specific modules or layers without affecting the entire system, and improved reusability and scalability, as modules can be reused in different projects and layers can be independently scaled or modified.
> 
> **Cons:** performance issues due to data transmission overhead between layers and complexity in managing and ensuring interaction and consistency among various modules and layers.

Layered Architecture

**2\. Service-oriented (SOA):** Divides a system into individual services, each providing specific functionalities and allowing them to communicate and interact, promoting reusability and easier management of each service independently. Examples of SOA architectures are **Microservices**, **Broker**, and **Serverless**.

> **Pros:** allows software to adapt to changes quickly, can work well as things scale up, and lets different software systems talk to each other smoothly. Services can also be reused in different areas, saving time and effort.
> 
> **Cons:** itcan be tricky because managing all the different services and how they interact can get complex. It might slow down system performance due to the extra steps in communication between services, but it can also be hard to debug if an error happens.

Microservice Architecture

**3\. Component-Based:** The software is built using different modular components, each providing a specific functionality, and these components can be easily replaced, updated, or modified without affecting the entire system. Examples of Component-Based architectures are **Microkernel, Object-Oriented,** and **Plug-in** architectures.

> **Pros:** allows for flexibility in system evolution, as components can be added or updated independently, and promotes reusability, as components can be employed across various projects. It also enables parallel development and potentially reduces development costs and time.
> 
> **Cons:** introduces challenges such as ensuring coherent and reliable interactions among components, which can be complex and error-prone.

Micro kernel Architecture

**4\. Distributed Systems:** Divides and manages the software components across multiple machines or networks to provide a unified service, enhancing scalability and reliability. Examples of Distributed Systems are **Peer-to-Peer** and **Space-based** architectures.

> **Pros:** the system can efficiently manage loads by distributing them across various nodes, reducing the risk of single points of failure and often providing robustness against faults or disruptions.
> 
> **Cons:** introduce complexities in ensuring data consistency, synchronization, and integrity across all nodes, especially in scenarios of network partitions or failures.

Space-based Architecture

**5\. Event-Driven:** Designed to respond to events or messages, where components perform actions in response to receiving specific notifications, making the system reactive and capable of handling asynchronous operations. Examples of Event-Driven Architectures are **Publish-Subscribe** and **Event-Driven** Architectures.

> **Pros:** allows for the decoupling of components, as producers and consumers of events do not need to interact directly, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
> 
> ==**Cons:**== ==managing and debugging systems in event-driven architectures can be complex due to the asynchronous and often non-deterministic nature of event processing.==

Event-Driven Architecture

**6\. Interpreter:** Involves translating high-level code into machine code line by line, executing it directly rather than compiling it first, providing flexibility but often at the cost of performance. These architectures include **Python Interpreter,****JavaScript Engine** (such as V8), **JVM**, etc.

> **Pros:** it allows developers to run code on various hardware platforms without requiring modification, and it often provides more straightforward error handling and debugging since the code is executed line-by-line, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.
> 
> **Cons:** It performs slower than compiled languages due to the overhead of interpreting code on the fly.

Interpreter architecture

**7\. Data-centric:** Prioritizes the management and utilization of data, ensuring that data integrity, storage, and retrieval are optimized, and the system’s functionalities are built around efficient data processing. Examples of Data-centric architectures are **CQRS, Event-Sourcing, Kappa,** and **Lambda** architectures.

> **Pros:** They ensure data consistency across systems and can facilitate detailed auditing and historical data analysis, particularly in the case of Event-sourcing. They also allow for the segregation of read and write workloads, enhancing performance and scalability in certain use cases.
> 
> **Cons:** they can be complex and may introduce additional overhead regarding system design, development, and maintenance. Ensuring data consistency and managing eventual consistency in distributed environments can be challenging.

What are your thoughts?  

```c
the first diagram, showing a hierarchy of architectural styles, is unreadable. A link to a readable version of it would be helpful.

```c
I’m a bit confused by the categorization here. Can’t an app be monolithic and event driven? Monolithic and microservices describe a pattern of web architecture, but interpreter is completely something else, so I find it difficult to draw any parallels across the list
```
