### Long Past Time for Brown to Join Those Globalizing the Threat of Anti-Zionism and Islamism; Latest on the Brown Shootings

(1) Brown’s Watson School (“Watson”) to host panel on “The Costs of War for U.S. Democracy”.

Watson describes the February 5 panel as follows:

“For the last 15 years, the [Costs of War](https://costsofwar.watson.brown.edu/) project has shed light on the economic, human, environmental, and social costs of US wars and military spending. This interdisciplinary panel reflects on the political costs of war for the United States today. Political scientist Neta C. Crawford examines how war affects democracy. Geographer Jennifer Greenburg discusses how public opinion toward war and military spending shapes American politics. Public finance expert Linda Bilmes describes her analysis of the “Ghost Budget,” a combination of US federal spending policies that have lowered government accountability and civic engagement, and increased corruption and overall expenditures.”

Fifteen years focused on why the U.S. is the world’s greatest warmonger, not, e.g., Iran, but the U.S. Fifteen years - amazing really. As noted above, the presenters on February 5 are Neta Crawford, Jennifer Greenburg and Linda Bilmes. I’ve posted several times on the biases, poor work product and otherwise deeply flawed recent publications by the Costs of War “project”, especially as related to Israeli responses to decades of Palestinian and Iran-backed jihadists murdering Israelis (and others) and attacking Israel’s right to exist including, of course, the war Hamas initiated against Israel on October 7, 2023. (Incredibly, Watson thought it would be appropriate to publish the last three “studies” on October 7, 2025, the second anniversary of the Islamist barbarism inflicted on Israeli men, women and children.)

I will not restate here what I’ve written previously about the quality of the supposed “analyses” by the various project authors, including Crawford, but attach below my post of November 30.

As to the February 5 panelists, nothing further need be said about Crawford beyond what I’ve previously written about her lack of qualifications as a supposed “scholar”. As to Greenburg, her website describes one of her papers for Watson as follows:

“2024. “ [Deserted”: The U.S. Military’s Sexual Assault Crisis as a Cost of War.](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2024/sexualassault)*Costs of War Project.* Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs: Brown University.

“The sexual assault crisis should draw our attention to the contradiction of military policies aimed at greater gender and racial equity when this institution waged post-9/11 wars that displaced 38 million people, directly killed 929,000 people, and indirectly killed 4.5-4.7 million people worldwide. These are casualties primarily among people of color in the Global South, with women and children disproportionately impacted by violent conflict,” **writes report author Jennifer Greenburg, an assistant professor of international relations at the University of Sheffield.** “One justification of the so-called ‘War on Terror’ was to restore Afghan women’s rights. Yet 20 years of war made Afghan women’s lives significantly worse. The wars waged by the U.S. are existentially linked both to the military as an institution and to racism and sexism within the United States.”  
  
*Press Release, Costs of War Project at Brown University, August 14, 2024”*

She’ll no doubt add real academic value to the February 5 panel.

I previously described Bilmes as a serious person unlike Crawford and Greenburg. That said, in 2008 she was the recipient of the “Speaking Truth to Power” award by the American Friends Service Committee, an organization hostile to Israel for decades. According to her website she serves as “as the sole United States member of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Public Administration” - the idea that the UN is even arguably competent to say one word about public administration is laughable. Both the award and her affiliation with the UN undermine her ability to speak credibly and/or objectively about the role of U.S. military spending to defend wars started by others and in defense of Western values. (Bilmes’s website also notes she teaches “workshops for newly-elected Mayors and Members of Congress”. Perhaps she can teach something to the anti-Semitic adolescent who just took office as Mayor of New York. She should focus on just basic things since he’s never before had a real job, e.g., define in necessarily very simple terms, the meaning of the word “budget”.)

In all events, there can be no doubt as to the message of Watson’s February 5 program. America is the Great Satan. 15 years of this at Brown with no end in sight. Incredible.

By way of contrast, when will Watson begin to address the threat of Islamism, in particular Western Islamism? On January 2, the Middle East Forum’s most recent “Focus on Western Islamism” bulletin covered “EU Funds Muslim Brotherhood Affiliates”, “Islamists Flee Sweden After Accused of Swindling Millions in Welfare Benefits”, “U.S. Government Provides Millions to Malaysia’s Muslim Brotherhood”, “Italy Dismantles Major Hamas Fundraising Network”. Is any of this, and so much more of the same, of interest to Watson? The report follows.

Perhaps someone at Watson will take an interest in jihadi activity in Africa, especially in Nigeria. According to the Middle East Media Research Institute (“MEMRI”) as published just last week:

“In December, ISIS Killed 29 African Christians; ISIS West Africa Claims Killing 11 Christians, Torching Church And 150 Homes In Nigeria; Syrian Jihadi Cleric: Muslim Authorities Are Obligated To Protect Christians; Syrian Teens Train With Rifles”.

Will Watson invite any of the scholars from the Institute for the Critical Study of Antizionism to speak? The newly launched organization has already had a number of articles published, and podcasts. Professor Andrew Pessin mentions just three in a post today (the references to “I” below refer to him):

“(1) Luke Tress did a deep dive on the new movement in the *Times of Israel*, “ [Antizionism is a New Chapter of Jew-Hatred](https://substack.com/redirect/36c48e8e-09e5-41fd-aa3c-a5180bd3e99c?j=eyJ1IjoicGVvdmQifQ.MSgPOokOdGct2HEr0aOBjSPNRAscUctAI-2wfzOM4VE).”

(2) Eric Buesing, whose work I’m just getting to know, did a really deep dive into the problem, “ [America is teaching kids to hate Jews—and even itself](https://substack.com/redirect/30a7b8c8-bba1-4f49-9a76-f4b264d7735e?j=eyJ1IjoicGVvdmQifQ.MSgPOokOdGct2HEr0aOBjSPNRAscUctAI-2wfzOM4VE).”

(3) I was recently privileged to appear on the wonderful podcast, “Here I Am With Shai Davidai,” on the topic of “The Hidden War on Jewish Professors.” I might quibble with the title; the war is not so hidden. In that podcast I provide an overview of the campus situation for Zionists and Jews (bad), offer some analysis of how we got to this point, and suggest some possible responses—including the first public mention of ICSA. Check it out [here](https://substack.com/redirect/87717615-9440-4849-bd23-f0e07c118c68?j=eyJ1IjoicGVvdmQifQ.MSgPOokOdGct2HEr0aOBjSPNRAscUctAI-2wfzOM4VE).”

How about a speaker from the Institute For The Study of Global Antisemitism & Policy to address the corrupt and contemptible Qataris? (Since Brown has happily taken money from Qatar over the years, I suppose that would be too much to ask.)

But don’t hold your breath. At Brown the only acceptable narratives are that of, e.g., the poor, oppressed Palestinians; propaganda based on the rote incantation of Israeli “genocide” pushed by people who couldn’t distinguish between actual genocide and a cereal box; and the mythical “state” of Palestine, a “state” that has never existed in all of recorded time.

(2) The Brown Shootings

So far as I know, not a single word about the shootings has been said by a Member of the Brown Corporation (called Trustees in most other institutions). Reading the press reports, the university seems anxious to write off the shooter’s motive as some sort of longstanding dispute he had with the MIT professor he killed and/or a gun control problem. One or both may be true, or not. Hopefully the investigation will get to the bottom of the motive issue, including why he chose to go to Brown to carry out his crime more than 20 years after he was a student there.

The only development of note is a letter of December 30 from interim vice-president for public safety distributed by Brown’s Office of Alumni Relations. The communication from the interim public safety head is basically a rehash of the platitudes and pablum contained in the communications by Brown president Paxson.

“Dear Members of the Brown University Community,

I am writing to you today in my first days as interim vice president for public safety with a profound sense of responsibility, humility and resolve.

The Brown community has experienced an unspeakable tragedy. The recent act of violence that took the lives of Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov and injured nine other members of our campus family has shaken us to our core. There are no words that can fully capture the deep sense of loss, grief and pain many of you are feeling, while some also have natural feelings of anxiety and lingering fear. I want to say clearly and unequivocally: What happened on Dec. 13 should never happen again — at Brown or anywhere — and we must confront that imperative for our community with steadfast purpose.

As I step into this role, I do so fully aware that there are critical questions about the strength of our safety and security systems. Acknowledging those questions is not about assigning blame — it is about responsibility, learning and improvement. My commitment to you is simple and unwavering: We will build a stronger, sophisticated and more resilient model of campus safety — together.

Safety requires more than visible security. It is built through preparation, transparency, trust and partnership. My vision for public safety at Brown is one that is community-centered, proactive and grounded in best practices, modern technology and clear communication. I am honored to serve with colleagues in Brown’s leadership who share this vision.

**Elevated Public Safety Presence and Actions to Date**

In the weeks ahead, Brown’s Department of Public Safety and Emergency Management (or DPSEM, which is the new name of DPS since the department restructured earlier this year) will continue to maintain an elevated and visible presence across campus. This enhanced presence includes more safety and security officers across academic buildings, residential areas and events, while buildings also will continue to require card access, a key or displaying a University ID for entry.

We are increasing security staffing in phases, aligned with the ramp-up of operations and the increase of students, faculty and staff on campus as we transition from the lesser density of the holiday break and Winter Session, to the Jan. 6 end of the administrative Winter Break and resumption of medical school courses, to the start of the second semester on Jan. 21. To ensure coverage and support wherever it is needed, we are deploying a complement of DPSEM officers, coordinated mutual aid from partner agencies and well-trained private security resources.

At the same time, several priority projects are being accelerated for completion prior to the Spring 2026 semester. These include:

- Transition to card access for the remaining buildings currently requiring keys for entry (with assigned officers at those buildings until the technology transition is complete)
- Expansion of blue light phones with integrated cameras across campus
- Installing additional security cameras in key areas, including at Barus & Holley, pending final determinations arising from the Campus Safety and Security Assessment announced Dec. 22
- Expansion of panic buttons in critical locations to ensure rapid access to help when it is needed most
- Strengthened coordination among campus partners, local agencies and regional mental health resources
- Enhanced public safety training, staffing and operating systems for rapid and effective communications during emergencies
- Reinforced messages of available resources supporting crime prevention and emergency management (see the important information in the Resources section at the end of this letter)

These efforts are part of a broad and multi-pronged approach to campus safety that integrates prevention, response and communication across the University.

As President Paxson shared in her [message to the community Dec. 22](https://bbis.advancement.brown.edu/bbphenix/page.redir?target=https%3a%2f%2fpresident.brown.edu%2fpresident%2fimmediate-actions-safety-and-security&srcid=308337&srctid=1&erid=2ccd0f16-28f9-4cc3-89f1-bbd8e3135eb0&trid=2ccd0f16-28f9-4cc3-89f1-bbd8e3135eb0), we also are moving forward with two important security initiatives, both of which will be conducted by external firms commissioned by the Corporation of Brown University. The first is an After-Action Review that will study the safety and security preparedness surrounding the Dec. 13 incident, as well as the emergency management response in its aftermath. The second is a comprehensive Campus Safety and Security Assessment that will examine all aspects of our security systems, policies and practices, and incorporate community input. The Campus Safety and Security Assessment will build on the immediate actions underway this month.

**Looking Ahead to the Spring Semester**

Even as we focus on the strength of proactive safety measures, equipping our campus community with the training needed to respond in the event of a safety threat is another top priority. During the spring semester, we will offer the Brown community new safety training and active-shooter preparedness training aligned with trauma-informed approaches. This will build upon the training the University has provided to individuals and departments in the past, which focuses on clear, practical guidance.

In addition, the University has pledged meaningful opportunities for students, faculty and staff to share concerns, ideas and feedback in the weeks and months ahead for what it means to maintain a secure campus. And you will see a public safety leadership team that listens and acts. Over the coming weeks, I will be active across campus listening, learning and working alongside colleagues to ensure that our approach is responsive, thoughtful and grounded in care for the people of this community and the values of Brown.

I want you to know this: Our goal is not to create a campus defined by fear, but one defined by preparedness, vigilance and mutual care. We are committed to maintaining a campus where every member of this community — students, faculty, staff and visitors — can learn, work and live with confidence that they are doing so in spaces that support a strong academic mission while also being secure.

I share the commitment expressed by President Paxson to take all possible steps to increase the safety and security of the Brown campus and protect against future harm for our community. I also know that rebuilding trust takes time, and it begins with consistency and truth. You have my promise that I will lead with integrity, transparency and an unwavering focus on your safety and well-being.

As I embrace the privilege of being a member of this extraordinary Brown community, I want to honor the victims of Dec. 13 by working with campus partners to bring about meaningful change. I hope to honor the injured by ensuring this campus is safer tomorrow than it was yesterday. And as students, faculty and staff, we can honor this community by standing strong together — resilient, compassionate and determined.

Thank you for the trust you place in this institution and in the work ahead. I look forward to engaging with you directly and often as we move forward.

With resolve and respect,

Hugh T. Clements Jr.  
Interim Vice President for Public Safety

**How to Report Concerns**  
It is vital that all members of the Brown community fully understand the mechanisms for reporting public safety and security concerns.

- **Emergencies:** Call the Brown Department of Public Safety and Emergency Management (DPSEM) at 401-863-4111 or dial 911.
- **Non-emergencies and safety concerns:** Call DPSEM at 401-863-3322.

If you are unsure whether a security concern warrants a call, it is best to call public safety to allow the department to assess and determine any appropriate action. The Department of Public Safety and Emergency Management is reviewing its internal systems to ensure concerns are routed, tracked and addressed consistently, and we will share more about this new model.

**Staying Connected to Alerts**  
All members of the Brown community and affiliates are strongly encouraged to [ensure your contact information is current](https://bbis.advancement.brown.edu/bbphenix/page.redir?target=https%3a%2f%2fwww.brown.edu%2femergency%2fbrownalert-system&srcid=308337&srctid=1&erid=2ccd0f16-28f9-4cc3-89f1-bbd8e3135eb0&trid=2ccd0f16-28f9-4cc3-89f1-bbd8e3135eb0) in the RAVE BrownAlert notification system to ensure you receive timely emergency notifications and important safety updates. Any member of the greater community — including parents and family of Brown students, or members of the RISD community, for example — may opt in to receive BrownAlert updates.

Also, members of the Brown community should download the RAVE Brown Guardian app. This tool provides an additional mechanism for contacting public safety if you need assistance and has embedded GPS capabilities to allow emergency responders to locate you quickly and dispatch help in an emergency.

**BrownReady preparedness**  
The [BrownReady website](https://bbis.advancement.brown.edu/bbphenix/page.redir?target=https%3a%2f%2fpublicsafety.brown.edu%2femergency-management%2fbrownready&srcid=308337&srctid=1&erid=2ccd0f16-28f9-4cc3-89f1-bbd8e3135eb0&trid=2ccd0f16-28f9-4cc3-89f1-bbd8e3135eb0) reflects emergency preparedness guidance written by experts to keep college and university campuses safe, including information about programs, emergency communication systems, training and response.

**Safety Awareness Information**  
Please review the Brown [DPSEM website](https://bbis.advancement.brown.edu/bbphenix/page.redir?target=https%3a%2f%2fpublicsafety.brown.edu%2fcrime-prevention%2fsafety-tips&srcid=308337&srctid=1&erid=2ccd0f16-28f9-4cc3-89f1-bbd8e3135eb0&trid=2ccd0f16-28f9-4cc3-89f1-bbd8e3135eb0) for additional safety information and resources.

The most basic question raised by the letter is what on earth had Brown been doing to ensure campus safety before the shooting if not everything noted in Clements’s letter that supposedly only now will be forthcoming?

One paragraph in the Clements letter is noteworthy in this regard:

“Safety requires more than visible security. It is built through preparation, transparency, trust and partnership. My vision for public safety at Brown is one that is community-centered, proactive and grounded in best practices, modern technology and clear communication. I am honored to serve with colleagues in Brown’s leadership who share this vision.”

Leaving aside whatever “community-centered” security/policing means in the Brown context, exactly what “vision” did Brown have about campus security prior to the shootings?

One other comment in Clements’s letter merits brief note. He says “acknowledging those questions \[about the shootings\] is not about assigning blame - it is about responsibility, learning and improvement.” Since former head of security Chatman is already on leave, Clements seems to be telegraphing that anyone employed by Brown other than Chatman who had any role, direct or indirect, in the horrific events of December 13 can rest assured that he/she will face no consequences no matter how egregious their mistakes may have been. If that turns out to be the case, the concept of “responsibility” stated in his letter is meaningless.
