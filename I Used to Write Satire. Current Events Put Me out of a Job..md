I’ve written 20 books, 14 of them novels that more or less fall into the category of political satire. Many a reviewer has sniffed that subtlety is not among the tools in my fictional sandbox. But like Robin Goodfellow in *[A Midsummer Night’s Dream](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780199535866)*, “Those things do best please me that befall preposterously.”

[My first novel](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780140249286) was published in 1986. It opens on January 20, 1989, as the president-elect’s motorcade pulls up to the White House to collect about-to-be-ex-president Ronald Reagan for the trip to the Capitol and the swearing-in ceremony of his successor. But there’s a problem: President Reagan has gone a bit, well, dotty. He’s still in his pajamas and just doesn’t feel like going out. It’s not a power grab. The old guy just isn’t up for leaving today. Maybe tomorrow.

Forty years ago, the idea of the U.S. president refusing to leave office was a quaint notion. The opening scene got the novel noticed, and the book made the bestseller lists.

I confessed to an interviewer that I was somewhat nervous about how President Reagan—much less Mrs. Reagan—might feel about it. I’d worked for two years in his administration and had known the Reagans, through my parents, since I was a teenager.

Three days after the interview appeared, a letter arrived, [franked](https://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2020/pb22539/html/info_004.htm), the upper left corner embossed in gold: “The President.” My bowels loosened. But its theme wasn’t *Et tu, Brute.* It was a handwritten note congratulating me on the book’s success. Reagan was “delighted that I was able to play some small role in it.”

I exhume this dusty anecdote to recall what a class act Ronald Reagan was, and to lament that 40 years later, the Oval Office is where decency goes to die. January 6, a date formerly associated with “Twelfth Night” and the Adoration of the Magi, is now and forever the day the U.S. Capitol was stormed by a mob agitated to violence by a president of the United States claiming arrantly, falsely, and ridiculously that he’d been cheated of a fair election. The new American millennium compressed: from [hanging chads](https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/hanging-chad) to “ [Hang Mike Pence](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/25/trump-expressed-support-hanging-pence-capitol-riot-jan-6-00035117?ref=pressrex.com).”

This being America, someone quickly distilled humor from the blood, smeared feces, bodies, shattered principles, and spent cartridges. Andrew Clyde, the honorable gentleman from Georgia’s 9th district, [sniffed that](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republican-loyal-trump-claims-capitol-riot-looked-more-normal-tourist-n1267163) some of the footage of January 6 looked like nothing more than “a normal tourist visit” on Capitol Hill.

I had to doff my hat: Here was centrifuge-level spin, given the photo [showing him](https://www.yahoo.com/news/republican-congressman-denied-insurrection-likened-105348005.html) on that normal tourist day desperately trying to barricade the House chamber doors with furniture. In due course, he trotted out the standard Washington *non mea culpa*. His statement had been taken [out of context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxifQ07-OfM).

In the good old days, before the unthinkable became routine, I eagerly opened my morning newspaper in hopes of finding fish to shoot in my barrel. Now, I make a sign of the cross. As Dorothy Parker asked, “What fresh hell is this?”

Hunter S. Thompson, America’s most feral satirist, said, “When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.” These last 25 years—a mere one-tenth of what pundits are calling, more and more wryly, “the American experiment”—the going has been pretty weird. Social media, TikTok, ChatGPT, deepfakes, and the other creepy-crawlies in Pandora’s box have turned us all into scorpions in a shaken bottle. Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump’s erstwhile wartime consigliere, unblushingly told author Michael Lewis that “Democrats don’t matter. The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.” Mission accomplished! We are living in the House That Poo Built.

It’s been quite a year, so far. The East Wing of the White House [seems to have disappeared](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2025/trump-east-wing-construction/) but will be replaced by a ballroom the size of Rhode Island. In other White House decor notes, denigrating plaques [have been installed](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hangs-plaques-mocking-biden-obama-white-house/story?id=128492648) beneath portraits of inferior past U.S. presidents.

The Kennedy Center has a [shiny new co-name](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-trouble-with-quitting-the-trump), which for some reason is repelling rather than attracting artistic talent. But there’s good news: We plebs are to have bread and circuses in the form of an Ultimate Fighting Championship on White House grounds. (In June. Mark your *calendarium*.) And [there’s talk](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5669878-trump-construction-washington-new-arch-2026/) of an Arch of Triumph across Memorial Bridge from the Lincoln Memorial, which for some reason has this far escaped renaming.

Soon, Greenland, Iceland, the Azores, Bermuda, the Canary Islands, and Madeira will be welcomed into our happy union as the 51st, 52nd, 53rd, 54th, 55th and 56th states, moated by the renamed “American Ocean.” Nothing floods a zone like an ocean.

The majority of FBI agents seem to be hard at work keeping our nation safe [by scrubbing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-01/epstein-files-trump-s-name-was-redacted-by-the-fbi) 5.2 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein files of the name “Trump.” (5.2 million pages? Really? Really.) ICE Queen Kristi Noem declared mother-of-three Renee Good a “domestic terrorist.” (*Quiet, quiet, Piggy!*) Reichsprotektor Miller pronounced Good an “assassin.” And now comes the news that ICE agents will be dispatched to the Winter Olympics, presumably to represent America in the biathalon.

As Bertie Wooster would say, it’s all a bit much to spring on a lad with a morning head.

If you have nothing better to do, google an op-ed that appeared in *The* *Wall Street Journal* on October 21, 1999—a parody of a Trump inaugural address. Opening line: “This is a great day for me personally.”

*President* Trump? What a notion! As [Yogi Berra said](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/09/yogi-berra-baseballs-philosopher-king/407041/) on being told that Dublin had elected a Jewish mayor: “Only in America!” Satire was fun, then.

I’ve hung up my funny-sneakers, feeling overtaken—indeed, flattened—by events.

Tom Lehrer, MIT and Harvard mathematician and one of America’s greatest-ever satirists, [died last year](https://www.thefp.com/p/what-tom-lehrer-left-us). He is missed but well remembered for retiring from satire [on the grounds](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/31/artsfeatures1) that Henry Kissinger had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Lehrer recognized, with a mathematician’s exactitude, that reality had rendered satire pointless, even inappropriate. He said he felt like “a resident of Pompeii who has been asked for some humorous comments on lava.” A zone flooded with lava stays flooded.

Vietnam [ruined satire for him](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/27/theater/tom-lehrer-renaissance-in-village.html) long before Kissinger’s Nobel. “My purpose,” he said, “was to make people laugh, and not applaud. If the audience applauds, they’re just showing they agree with me. But that’s not humor.” Today’s lords of late-night TV—Colbert, Kimmel, Meyers, Stewart, *SNL*, et al.—are funny, but they’re working the audience for applause. And getting it.

I’ve hung up my funny-sneakers, feeling overtaken—indeed, flattened—by events. But I’m glad that others are hard at it. Laughter is subversive, and often the best revenge. Nothing annoys tyrants, large and petty, more than ridicule. Trump’s 3 a.m. bellowings on Truth Social—what a name!—insisting that *SNL*, Colbert, Kimmel and other late-night wags have NO RIGHT TO MAKE FUN OF HIM starkly reveal his lack of what he could perhaps most use: a sense of humor.

Forgive me for mentioning [this headline](https://www.nytimes.com/1939/02/04/archives/goebbels-ends-careers-of-five-aryan-actors-who-made-witticisms.html) in *The New York Times* of February 4, 1939:

> “Goebbels Ends Career of Five ‘Aryan’ Actors Who Made Witticisms About the Nazi Regime.”

Today we have Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr, telling ABC to cancel Jimmy Kimmel, enemy of the state: “We can do this the easy way, or the hard way.” *We haf ways of making you not talk, Herr Kimmel.*

George H.W. Bush was savagely parodied by SNL’s Dana Carvey. He retaliated by inviting Carvey to spend the night at the White House. They [became pals](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-george-h-w-bushs-unlikely-friendship-with-dana-carvey/). Both Reagan and Bush endured heaps of abuse, but they were fundamentally impervious to ridicule. It washed off them. They loved to laugh. They got the jokes. They had sunny souls.

Ronald Reagan’s [presidential diary](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/reagans-daily-diary) was famously nontaxing, with many an afternoon devoted to “personal time.” Teased about it, [he said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1987/04/27/the-truth-in-reagans-humor/4540f5ea-45e1-4cf7-a635-28b1ea471234/), “It’s true that hard work never killed anybody, but I figure, why take the chance?”

Forgive a cranky old satirist for indulging in nostalgia. Someday, this nasty—to use a Trump word—era we’re living through will mercifully end. We’ll peer out of our silos, blinking and murmuring, *WTF was* that *about?*

And we’ll laugh, but not applaud.
