Prompted by commuters' discomfort around the homeless, Port Authority officials said yesterday that they would begin a crackdown in the bus terminal on Eighth Avenue, evicting anyone found loitering, panhandling or sleeping there, even in freezing weather.

The policy, patterned on the one the Transit Authority intends to use in the city's subways, will include preventing anyone from lying down in the terminal or using the bathrooms to wash up.

At the same time, however, police officers will offer help to those who want to go to a shelter or a drug-treatment program.

With winter approaching, the policy is the latest move in what has become an almost annual ritual of trying to find a humane solution for the thousands of homeless people who seek shelter in public places.

In recent months, however, several government agencies have signaled a new get-tough approach. With the approval of the Dinkins administration, the homeless have been driven from a number of streets, parks, bank lobbies and other public areas. At the same time, they are usually offered social services.

The Port Authority's plan is to go into effect on Dec. 1.

Advocates for the homeless assailed the policy as yet another insensitve reaction to the homeless at a time when cold weather has begun to force the homeless to seek warmer environments in public buildings.

Port Authority officials said their actions were prompted in part by a recent survey of the bus commuters, who rated the presence of the homeless as the "most negative aspect of the terminal."

"There is a feeling of discomfort and lack of security among the commuters because of the presence of the homeless," said Richard Kelly, director of the Port Authority's Interstate Transportation Department. "We want our customers to perceive the bus terminal as a clean, safe place to come to."

Reactions among commuters at the bus terminal yesterday were mixed, although most people seemed to welcome more stringent enforcement of the rules as long as the homeless had an alternative.

"We know many New Jersey women who will not come through the Port Authority bus terminal because of the homeless and street people," said Rue Sandler, a commuter from Cedar Grove, N.J. "When I use the bus terminal, I feel unhappy about what I see, but what are we going to do with the homeless as winter approaches?"

Throughout the terminal yesterday, homeless men could be seen sleeping alongside escalators and in the stairwells, scattered among the commuters buying fast food and newspapers. The homeless, usually disheveled and dirty, were in sharp contrast to the otherwise clean, modern surroundings.

In trying to rid the subways of the homeless, the Transit Authority plans to offer them a ride to city shelters. But Mr. Kelly said the Port Authority was negotiating with several nonprofit agencies, including the Manhattan Bowery Project, the Salvation Army and Volunteers of America, to determine what services might be offered to the homeless. Such organizations have offered shelter to the homeless.

On cold nights as many as 230 homeless have been counted sleeping in the terminal. Mr. Kelly estimated this would cost more than $300,000 a year. In the past, the the removal of the homeless has been a low priority.

Bing Markee, president of the Port Authority Police Benevolent Association, the police union, said police officers favor more stringent enforcement of the terminal's rules and regulations, but they do not want to force the homeless out onto the streets if there are not appropriate shelters and services for them. Training in how to deal with the homeless who may have tuberculosis, AIDS and mental illnesses will begin today for the 150-member police force stationed at the bus terminal.

Previously, he said, Port Authority officials had made other crimes like robbery and pickpocketing, a higher priority.

"Unless the Port Authority puts additional officers in there to deal with the homeless, they will continue to be a low priority," Mr. Markee said. "The police have to deal with too many other important crimes and responsibilities. If this new effort is just window dressing, it's not going to be effective."

Advocates said they were not optimistic about the success of the program.

"It's utterly frustrating that another transportation facility now is just turning the homeless out," said Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. "The fact is that all of the private not-for-profit social-service providers are stretched to the limit in dealing with the caseloads. This sounds like the making of a grim winter."
