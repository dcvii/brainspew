Matt Rocklin argues that experienced programmers should embrace AI coding tools because their expertise allows them to avoid 'AI slop' while dramatically expanding their capabilities. He acknowledges valid concerns about AI-generated code quality and the dehumanizing experience of constantly approving AI actions, but offers practical solutions including hooks for automation, sound notifications, and investing in tests rather than code review. The core shift he advocates is moving from implementing code to thinking well and constructing feedback systems that guide AI to good solutions. He suggests the transition is similar to when compilers replaced hand-written assembly—we lose some understanding but gain tremendous leverage.

### Key Insight

> The programmer's value has shifted from implementation skill to thinking skill—our job is now to construct feedback systems that guide AI to good solutions, not to write code ourselves.

### Money Quotes

- "
	No, you're not too good to vibe code. In fact, you're the only person who should be vibe coding.
- "
	We're able to generate code far more quickly than we're able to read it.
- "
	Unlike human authors, the AI has no ego at stake in its work, and isn't in the least bit lazy.
- "
	AI has flaws, but it is diligent, and it lacks ego. If you question it, it'll investigate thoroughly and critique its own work honestly.
- "
	Our ability to zoom in and implement code is now obsolete. Our ability to zoom out and think well is not.
- "
	Our job is to automate our job, and to continuously climb the ladder of abstraction.
- "
	Code is free these days. Asking for someone else's script is kind of like asking for someone else's compiled binary. There's no need; just make it yourself. It's trivial.
- "
	The code we write with AI probably won't be as good as hand-crafted code, but we'll write 10x more of it.
