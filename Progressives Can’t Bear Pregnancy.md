Is giving birth in America unbearable?

That’s the implication of a new book by *New York* magazine journalist Irin Carmon, which tracks five women’s perilous pregnancies to reveal how maternal health in this country is riddled with malpractice. Two of the women die during childbirth. One is failed by an overworked anesthesiologist who should have been dismissed years earlier. The book creates a dizzying sense that having a baby in the United States is harrowingly dangerous. [Its title is](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781668032602) *[Unbearable](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781668032602)*.

The book exposes real cruelty, from the small humiliations inflicted by hospitals that treat women as potential lawsuits, to preventable deaths. America’s maternal mortality rate is shocking: In 2023—the most recent year for which there’s [reliable data](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2025/jul/maternal-mortality-united-states-2025) —almost 19 in 100,000 women died in childbirth. (The [equivalent figure](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/20/maternal-deaths-rising-in-uk-despite-fewer-births-official-figures-show) in the UK was 12.67.) Among black women, the rate was [50 in 100,000](https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mortality-in-the-u-s-a-declining-trend-with-persistent-racial-disparities-in-the-black-population/). Every American should demand better care for mothers—and be grateful to Carmon for her reporting.

But she is anxious about a side effect of her book. In [an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/opinion/pregnancy-birth-children.html) she wrote for *The New York* *Times* to promote the book, she admits to wondering, sometimes, if “talking honestly about what’s messy and painful and unfair about pregnancy and parenting can make choosing it seem almost absurd.” And in this sentence, she captures what is, right now, one of the left’s fundamental challenges. We live in a country where birth rates are plunging, even though the majority of young Americans still say they want children. Yet Democrats seem incapable of presenting a positive vision of pregnancy, childbirth, or parenting.

For this, the left usually blames the right. “It is hard to tell a nuanced story of pregnancy and parenting at this moment, when the most powerful people in the country talk paternalistically about whether women are having enough children,” Carmon writes. And it’s true that it’s hard to make motherhood sound liberating when powerful men such as [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1914640691633717284) and J.D. Vance keep turning birth rates into culture-war talking points, or making jabs at “ [childless cat ladies](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/jd-vance-doubles-childless-cat-ladies-dig-got-nothing-cats-rcna163857).”

The left can catalog every injustice done to mothers but cannot quite say, without irony, that birth might also be a form of joy.

But the liberal reaction to the right’s often ham-fisted approach to pronatalism borders on the extreme. Earlier this year, Laurie Pohutsky, a member of the Michigan House of Representatives, claimed that she had [sterilized herself](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/02/08/im-democrat-politician-this-why-sterilised-myself-trump/) because the Republicans had won the last presidential election. “Just under two weeks ago, I underwent surgery to ensure that I would never have to navigate a pregnancy in Donald Trump’s America,” she told a crowd, adding: “If you know people who are questioning how serious this is, I’m going to repeat myself: A sitting government official opted for [voluntary sterilization](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/women-and-girls/california-sterilisation-scandal-compensation-hysterectomy/) because she was uncertain she would be able to access contraception in the future.”

The left can catalog every injustice done to mothers but cannot quite say, without irony, that birth might also be a form of joy. “I have spent the past three years reporting a book about how this country makes being pregnant harder than it should be,” writes Carmon. “I wince when talking about what can be beautiful about bearing and raising children, not wanting to sound cloying, preening, or prescriptive.”

She *winces* when talking about babies.

And so do many people in her tribe. In an interview with Carmon for her book, *New York* magazine’s [Emily Gould writes](https://nymag.substack.com/p/make-abortion-and-mtv-great-again):

> I’d always been pro–abortion rights, but my first (wanted) pregnancy—the otherworldly experience of being inhabited by a parasitic being—radicalized me. I understood then that being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term would feel like being held hostage in your own body.

It’s normal for progressive commentators to speak like this: to compare carrying a child to a traumatic ordeal. After *The Times* of Londonpublished a profile of Hannah Neeleman—the Mormon influencer who gave up on a promising career as a dancer, married a multimillionaire, and now has eight children and the wildly popular and likely lucrative Instagram account “ [Ballerina Farm](https://www.instagram.com/ballerinafarm/) ”—the hyper-progressive *Jezebel* called her lifestyle “ [bleak as hell](https://www.jezebel.com/a-peek-behind-the-ballerina-farm-facade-is-bleak-as-hell) ” and opined: “There doesn’t seem to be anything stopping him (especially not birth control) from continuing to impregnate her until, I suppose, her body gives out, which will be seen as an act of God.”

“It’s normal for progressive commentators to compare carrying a child to a traumatic ordeal,” writes Kara Kennedy. ([@BallerinaFarm](https://www.instagram.com/ballerinafarm/) via Instagram)

There’s a sense on the left that the act of giving birth is an insane, traumatic thing to do, an infringement on all women’s bodily autonomy. Maybe that’s one reason why birth rates are falling particularly precipitously [among Democrats](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/democrat-baby-bust-trump-population-decline/681619/). In *Unbearable*, one pregnant woman—having just been denied bail because she tested positive for methamphetamine, amphetamine, and fentanyl—tells Carmon: “Because you’re pregnant, you lose every single right you have.”

At the same time, conservatives make motherhood look like a meaningful, glorious, maybe even fun thing to do. The glossy, sentimental tributes, the Instagram-ready family portraits, and the “trad wives” baking bread in linen dresses: All these things reinforce their image as the tribe of mothers.

Which makes it vaguely embarrassing for left-wing women to crave motherhood. My most progressive friends talk in hushed tones about wanting kids, as if confessing a vice. One of them, after a few glasses of wine, told me she dreams of being a stay-at-home mother. She couldn’t tell her boyfriend. She couldn’t even tell her closest friend. To say it aloud would feel like a betrayal of everything she is supposed to believe. Extreme progressives turn on women who express entirely ordinary wishes about family. When Taylor Swift released the song “ [Wi$h Li$t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqgUzLHgNMI),” in which she fantasizes about having kids with her new fiancé, Travis Kelce—“Get the whole block lookin’ like you”—critics accused her of [being racist](https://www.melissafabello.com/blog/taylor-swift-racism). (“Pushing the idea of passing on one’s genes, in the context of whiteness, has history to it,” one writer noted, ominously.)

There’s a sense on the left that the act of giving birth is an insane, traumatic thing to do, an infringement on all women’s bodily autonomy.

On Instagram, liberal mothers tend to emphasize the negative parts of parenthood. To do otherwise is to suggest your allegiance to all the old social constructs. A particularly jarring recent trend has seen [women posting](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQFQkz0jP-X/?img_index=5&igsh=MW9sYmZscmhlc3ZpcA%3D%3D) that their child’s first birthday is the “anniversary of my own survival,” as if cracking out a birthday cake and a smile were too much to ask after a year of diapers and breastfeeding and watching a part of yourself grow into a person you’ll love until your dying day.

But even without the negativity, there’s a problem with the way Democrats talk about pregnancy only in terms of bodily autonomy, empowerment, choice. Some of the women Carmon speaks to, especially the white and educated ones, talk about their pregnancies as an affront to their sovereignty. In *Unbearable*, we meet a Brooklyn bohemian who believes that hospitals are patriarchal temples and wants her birth to feel like a “natural, even psychedelic process that needed attentive guidance more often than it needed hospital attention”—only to end up needing an emergency transfer.

If you’ve ever been on Mom Instagram, you recognize this woman. She’s the mother who insists she’s not an incubator, who wants to be ungoverned by her biology. She may fear a callous medical system, and that is understandable. But it can be jarring to see how thoroughly she sees pregnancy through the logic of selfhood. She expects to be able to dictate the terms of childbirth, even though it is a fundamentally uncontrollable experience. It takes over, threatens, and remakes a woman’s body—and no medical system can change that.

And here I have to speak from experience. I’m five months pregnant now, and I had my first baby a little over a year ago. The birth I remember having is not the one I actually had, at least according to my husband and my doctor’s notes. Labor is a trance state, part dream, part trauma. It resists transcription. That’s why so many accounts of pregnancy read like mysticism or grievance or both. It’s not that women lie about it. It’s that the experience itself refuses to make any sense.

Carmon is stuck on the idea that the U.S. is a uniquely traumatic place to give birth. But even under the best care, birth is unpredictable, dangerous, and exhausting. As a Brit, I’m glad I delivered in the U.S. Friends who gave birth through the UK’s National Health Service have stories about everything from overworked nurses to uncomfortable beds. Every mother I know, rich or poor, medicated or “natural,” has a complaint to lodge—because birth itself is, by its nature, a shock to the system.

But in the relentless insistence on telling the truth about pain, the idea that childbirth could also be good is in danger of falling out of the frame. With the obsessive focus on autonomy, we deny the reality that childbirth erodes your independence forever. Mother and child are not autonomous; they are connected forever. And that’s wonderful. Birth is unbelievable, but not unbearable; we bear it every day.

*Unbearable* captures this, almost despite itself. Every woman in it is doing her best to hold her life together. To pass the tests, to breathe through the contractions. They are heroic, and a genuine left-wing politics of reproduction, if such a thing could exist, would recognize this. It would see the act of bearing not as submission but courage. It would insist that wanting children is not “absurd,” but a declaration of faith in the human future.
