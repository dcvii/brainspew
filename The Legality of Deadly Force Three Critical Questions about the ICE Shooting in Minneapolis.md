description: "University of South Carolina, Joseph F. Rice School of Law professor Seth W. Stoughton discusses the legal standards and critical factual questions surrounding the use of deadly force by a federal ICE agent in the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis, emphasizing the need for a careful and evidence-based evaluation under both constitutional and state law. Professor Stoughton argues that responsible analysis must focus on whether the agent’s conduct created or avoided unnecessary danger, whether a reasonable officer would have perceived an imminent threat, and whether the threat could have been mitigated without resorting to deadly force."

The recent fatal shooting of Renee Good by a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis has already prompted intense public debate, much of it unfolding before the relevant facts are fully known. That instinct is understandable—police shootings, particularly those involving federal agents engaging in controversial actions, implicate profound questions about authority, accountability, and public safety—but it is also precisely the moment when caution is most warranted. It is far too early for anyone to offer a definitive conclusion; indeed, doing so would be professionally inappropriate. It is possible, however, to identify the questions that will need to be answered to come to a definitive conclusion about whether the officer complied with or violated applicable law.

The legality of the ICE agent’s use of force in this case will likely turn on three specific facts: whether the agent made a reckless tactical decision by stepping in front of the vehicle, whether Ms. Good’s actions were reasonably perceived as presenting an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to the agent or others, and whether the agent could have reasonably resolved any threat presented by the vehicle’s forward movement by stepping out of the way instead of shooting.

## I. The Legal Standards for Evaluating Police Uses of Force

As I have written [previously](https://www.amazon.com/Evaluating-Police-Uses-Force-Stoughton/dp/1479814652), police uses of force are subject to review under multiple distinct standards. Professional agencies ask whether officers acted according to policy and training, applying an administrative standard, and community members assess officer actions according to their own expectations. Legal liability, however, depends on two different standards: constitutional law and state law.

### A. The Fourth Amendment Standard

[The use of physical force](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3331985254000340162) by government officials—including federal officers—is regulated primarily by the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable seizures. For many years, officers in different states operated under different rules; many states allowed officers to use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing felony suspect. In [*Tennessee v. Garner*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/1/), decided in 1985, the Supreme Court held that this “fleeing felon rule” was unconstitutional. In that case, an officer investigating a residential burglary-in-progress saw a “17 or 18 year\[\] old” suspect run out of the house and start climbing a chain link fence. Although the officer was “reasonably sure” that the suspect—Edward Garner, who was actually 15 years old—was not armed, the officer shot him in the back of the head to prevent his escape. The Court concluded that the officer’s use of deadly force to prevent the escape of a non-violent felon was unconstitutional, writing, “It is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape.”

In place of the fleeing felon rule, the Court adopted the standard that has remained in place for the last forty years: The Fourth Amendment allows officers to use deadly force, meaning force that is substantially likely to cause serious physical harm or death, in response to what is reasonably perceived as an imminent threat of serious physical harm or death. Put simply, the act of inflicting serious harm is “ [objectively reasonable](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/490/386/) ” when it is used to address a threat of serious harm. But, as the *Garner* Court wrote, when “the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.” In that way, the *Garner* Court’s deadly force rule predicted the “careful balancing” of individual liberty against government needs that the Court has articulated continually in use-of-force cases after *Garner*, from the 1989 case [*Graham v. Connor*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/490/386/) to as [recently as last term](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18421303892904890175) in [*Barnes v. Felix*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/605/23-1239/).

This standard is so clear and well accepted that the International Association of Chiefs of Police, working with ten other police organizations, included the “immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury” language in a [National Consensus paper](https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/2020-07/National_Consensus_Policy_On_Use_Of_Force%2007102020%20v3.pdf) on police uses of force.

### B. Minnesota State Law

Beyond the constitutional standard, police uses of force are also evaluated under state law. Although it is historically uncommon, state authorities can charge, and have charged, federal agents for alleged violations of state law. When that happens, a charged agent can remove (meaning transfer) the case from state court to federal court and invoke what is referred to as [Supremacy Clause immunity](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/135/1/). At that point, the court has to determine whether the agent was performing their federal duties and, if so, whether they were doing so in a reasonable manner. That second question, particularly, can be complicated; courts have taken [different approaches](https://statedemocracy.law.wisc.edu/featured/2025/explainer-can-states-prosecute-federal-officials/) to making that determination. If the federal officer was doing their job reasonably, the agent is immune from prosecution, meaning the state charges are dismissed. If the court finds that an agent was acting outside the scope of their duties or was performing their duties in an unreasonable way, however, the state prosecution can proceed (in federal court).

Of course, a state prosecution is only appropriate when there is reason to believe that someone violated state law. [Minnesota law](https://law.justia.com/codes/minnesota/chapters-609-624/chapter-609/section-609-066/) largely mirrors the constitutional standard, authorizing officers to use deadly force “to protect the peace officer or another from death or great bodily harm” that “is reasonably likely to occur absent action by the law enforcement officer.” There is one additional statutory provision that may prove significant, though; state law allows officers to shoot only when the threat “must be addressed through the use of deadly force without unreasonable delay.” This suggests that if the threat can be addressed *without* the use of deadly force, or if it is reasonable to delay, the use of deadly force would be inconsistent with state law.

## II. Understanding the Totality of the Circumstances

Knowing the legal standards is one thing, but any first-year law student can tell you that applying abstract legal rules to the facts of a specific case can be tricky. In use-of-force cases, reviewers need to keep in mind that law and police practices shape the process of identifying what exactly the facts *are*, including whether a subject’s actions constitute an imminent threat.

### A. Identifying the Operative Facts

Under both federal and state law, the most important question is likely to be whether it was reasonable to perceive Ms. Good’s actions as presenting an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm. This question cannot be answered by merely reviewing the various videos of the incident. Those videos provide necessary context, to be sure, but both constitutional and state law look at an incident from, as [the Supreme Court put it](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4306215806680760770), “the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,” keeping in mind the time-pressured nature of an officer’s decision making. That means we neither adopt the ICE agent’s subjective perceptions of what was happening nor treat the video of the incident as establishing the operative facts; instead, we have to ask what the hypothetical construct known as the “reasonable officer” would have perceived. Would the reasonable officer have known that Mr. Good had turned her wheels to the right, away from the agent, as seems clear from the video? Would the reasonable officer have perceived that the vehicle presented an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm?

### B. Assessing “Imminent Threat”

Answering that last question requires us to better understand the concept of “imminent threat.” Incorporating the common law elements of assault, [policing has defined](https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/2020-07/National_Consensus_Policy_On_Use_Of_Force%2007102020%20v3.pdf) that an imminent threat exists when a reasonable officer would believe that the subject has the ability, opportunity, and intention to cause a particular type of harm (here, serious physical injury or death). “Ability” refers to whether the subject has the physical capacity to cause the harm; a person holding a knife has the physical capability of using the knife to stab an officer. “Opportunity” refers to whether there is a vulnerable target for that harm; a person with a knife who is forty feet away from an officer lacks the present opportunity to stab the officer. “Intention” refers to the subject’s apparent desire to cause the identified harm; an individual who is using a knife to slice a tomato while casually chatting with an officer who is arm’s length away might have the ability and opportunity, but not the intention, to use the knife as a weapon. This tripartite identification of threat is not merely a collection of words in a model policy or an aspirational academic taxonomy; [empirical](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10986111211066353) studies have confirmed that this is how [officers actually operationalize](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00224278231194711) the concept of “threat” in the day-to-day performance of their duties.

## III. Considerations

The framework so far applies to *all* uses of deadly force, but cases involving moving vehicles raise some additional considerations. Vehicles only move forward and backward, which means they are only a threat to officers who stand in front of or behind them. This raises two critical questions: why was the officer in front of the vehicle, and could he have stepped out of the way instead of shooting?

### A. Avoiding Unnecessary Danger

One factual issue that will be of central importance in this case is exactly where the officer was standing in relation to the vehicle not just at the time he began shooting, but at the time every shot was fired.

If the officer *was* in front of the vehicle, that raises another question: why? For decades, officers have been trained to avoid putting themselves into a vehicle’s path of travel. As an IACP Model Policy on Motor Vehicle Stops says, “At no time should the officer or others stand in front of, between, or behind the stopped vehicles.” Tactical guidance in policing has referred to stepping into a vehicle’s path of travel as “ [a very poor tactic](https://www.policemag.com/articles/cops-vs-cars),” “ [an ill-advised tactic](https://www.policemag.com/articles/understanding-officer-created-jeopardy),” as contrary to “ [common sense](https://www.policemag.com/articles/stay-out-of-the-way).” The reason is straightforward: an officer who puts themself in front of a vehicle is more likely to be threatened if that vehicle starts moving and, correspondingly, more likely to use deadly force to address what was essentially an avoidable threat. This is potentially relevant to the constitutional evaluation of police actions; the Supreme Court [recently clarified](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/605/23-1239/) that the Fourth Amendment requires looking at the “totality of the circumstances” leading up to a use of force, not just at the moment at which the officer used force. It is also potentially relevant to the adjudication of state law because Minnesota’s [Second Degree Manslaughter statute](https://law.justia.com/codes/minnesota/chapters-609-624/chapter-609/section-609-205/) criminalizes causing death “by…culpable negligence whereby the person creates an unreasonable risk, and consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another.” That last part, about whether the ICE agent *consciously* took the chance of causing death, may require assessing the agent’s history; [recent reporting](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/01/08/jonathan-ross-ice-officer-shot-renee-good/88087720007/) suggests that he was previously dragged by a vehicle, with Vice President JD Vance indicating that the agent was “a little sensitive about being rammed by an automobile.”

### B. Mitigating Danger Without Force

There is also the fact that shooting a moving vehicle is unlikely to actually address the threat of being struck by the vehicle. Simple physics explains why: a small, fast-moving bullet can’t physically stop something as large as a vehicle. While it is possible that a driver who has been shot at will bring their vehicle to a controlled stop, it is substantially more likely that a scared or injured driver will stomp on the accelerator. And even if the driver is instantly incapacitated, that simply creates an unguided missile, which is exactly what happened in Minnesota. Indeed, the [Department of Homeland Security Use of Force policy](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/23_0206_s1_use-of-force-policy-update.pdf) discourages officers from shooting at moving vehicles, reminding officers to “take into consideration the hazards that may be posed…by an out-of-control conveyance.”

Precisely because shooting a vehicle driver is unlikely to effectively address the threat of being struck, officers have been trained for decades that it is generally safer and more effective to [move out of a vehicle’s path](https://www.policemag.com/articles/stay-out-of-the-way) than it is to attempt to stop the vehicle by shooting the driver. As one police trainer put it [in 2006](https://www.policemag.com/articles/stay-out-of-the-way), “\[I\]f moving out of the way was the best way to escape the attack, shouldn’t that be the first option instead of the second option?” That conclusion has been broadly recognized across police agencies and organizations; the [IACP National Consensus paper](https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/2020-07/National_Consensus_Policy_On_Use_Of_Force%2007102020%20v3.pdf) reflects that “Firearms shall not be discharged at a moving vehicle” when the vehicle is the only weapon involved unless other means of addressing the threat presented by the vehicle, such as moving out of the way, “have been exhausted (or are not present or practical).”

## Conclusion

Ultimately, legal determinations should not turn on labels, politics, or preferred outcomes, but on facts. Whether the ICE agent’s actions in Minnesota were lawful as a matter of state or constitutional law will likely depend on whether the a agent’s own tactical decisions unnecessarily contributed to the danger that followed, whether the subject’s actions were reasonably perceived as presenting an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to the agent or others, and whether any threat presented by the vehicle could have been addressed through other means. Those are difficult questions, and they cannot be answered responsibly until the factual record is complete. But the questions themselves are well-settled, governed by legal standards and professional norms that apply to local, state, and federal officers. If public debate over officers’ legal liability is to be more than reflexive outrage or blind defense, we must all keep those standards in mind.
