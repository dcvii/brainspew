This weekend America saw how deadly the consequences of noncooperation can be. In the tragic ICE shooting of Alex Pretti, much of what happened is still in dispute. But we know—largely from videos that have been broadcast around the world—that the handgun Mr. Pretti legally owned and carried was taken from him before he was killed.

The sides harden into their positions, using words they will probably come to regret. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Mr. Pretti of “brandishing” his gun, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz—who last year called ICE “Trump’s modern-day Gestapo”—refers to ICE’s presence as an “occupation.” ICE meanwhile appears to operate safely enough in red states.

Mr. Pretti was the second Minneapolis resident fatally shot by ICE this month. Renee Good was killed when she refused a police order to get out of her car. Surely it’s possible to enforce the law and reduce the chances of a fatal encounter such as those that ended the lives of Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti.

The simplest way to make such encounters safer is for local authorities to cooperate with federal law enforcement. If ICE could count on this cooperation when its agents sought to arrest someone in Minnesota, the enforcement would be handled quietly and probably without incident.

One reason so many ICE agents are in Minnesota now is that every operation there needs not only agents to arrest the wanted person but others to protect them. Ideally that role is handled by local police, who know their cities, their culture and their people better than outsiders.

But with so many blue cities—including Minneapolis and St. Paul—having adopted “sanctuary” policies, the rules of the game are changed. Blue-state pols moralize about immigration while shirking responsibility for the signals they are sending. The main signal is for angry people to adjudicate immigration policy on the streets instead of in court or Congress.

The outrage that follows is also highly selective. Take the trespassers who disrupted a service at the Cities Church in St. Paul on Jan. 18 as live-streamed by former CNN host Don Lemon. They were full of moral indignation because one of the church pastors supposedly works for ICE.

Not one of the trespassers seemed to appreciate that the right to free exercise of religion is the first right mentioned in the First Amendment—even before freedom of speech and of the press. Or that attacking churches has an unsavory history usually associated with Southern men in white hoods.

Gov. Walz hasn’t condemned the Cities Church protesters, though the governor’s office issued a feeble statement that he “in no way supports interrupting a place of worship.” In a letter to Mr. Walz Saturday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi urged him to repeal Minnesota’s sanctuary policies and “reach an agreement with ICE” that “avoids pushing these interactions into your streets.”

Mr. Walz [writes nearby](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/tim-walz-the-un-american-assault-on-minnesota-67730de4?mod=article_inline) that the state Department of Corrections “honors all federal and local detainers.” But last February Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office issued an opinion that “Minnesota law prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from holding someone based on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be released from custody.”

Mr. Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stoke the flames, perhaps because the unrest helps divert attention from the $9 billion in taxpayer dollars lost to welfare fraud on their watch, which had dominated the news until these two ICE shootings.

On Fox News this weekend, Minnesota’s last Republican governor, Tim Pawlenty, highlighted the corrosive effect of the Walz-Frey resistance on federal law enforcement. He rightly emphasized that the videos of Mr. Pretti being shot provoke questions that demand answers. But he questioned the mentality that Minneapolis is exempt from federal laws because of the self-righteousness of people who don’t like them.

“This fact that the locals will not cooperate with the federal government,” he said, “and in fact affirmatively resist them, is one of the main reasons we have so much dysfunction in the situation in Minnesota.”

The details of shootings are messy—no surprise in such a highly charged and confused environment. What we do know is that when the time came for local leaders to use their knowledge and resources to reduce the lawlessness, they preferred that the streets direct events rather than the courts, law enforcement or the political process.

Here is a way to prevent altercations and violence involving federal officers on the streets of Minneapolis: order local police to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agents enforcing the nation’s immigration laws.

The corollary ought to be obvious but clearly isn’t: Tell citizens exercising their right to protest not to get in the way of those enforcing the law.
