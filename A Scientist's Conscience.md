### Joseph Rotblat and the Responsibility of Science

“Nuclear weapons pervade our thinking. Control our behaviour. Administer our societies. Inform our dreams. They bury themselves like meat hooks deep in the base of our brains. They are purveyors of madness. They are the ultimate colonizer.”

~ Arundhati Roy, The End of Imagination

As the race to develop artificial general intelligence accelerates, and murmurs grow about the need for a containment treaty reminiscent of the nuclear age (including by me), **it’s worth remembering one man who, faced with a similar moment of technological reckoning, chose conscience over consensus, and spent the rest of his life trying to save us from ourselves.**

He didn’t invent the bomb, but he was one of the few who walked away from it before it was used.

[Joseph Rotblat’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Rotblat) path to Los Alamos began not with ambition but with war. Born in Warsaw in 1908, he grew up in a Jewish family whose fortunes were broken by World War I. The collapse came quickly, the family horses were seized for the army, business collapsed, poverty settling in with bureaucratic permanence, food was frozen potatoes. He missed years of school, trained as an electrician at the tender age of 12, and in 1929 he began studying in the evenings at the [Free Polish University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Polish_University) in Warsaw, reading everything he could on science in three languages: Polish, English, and Russian.

By the 1930s, he was working with neutron sources and refining the experimental evidence for [inelastic scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inelastic_scattering), work that paralleled, and in some cases prefigured, discoveries from more celebrated labs in Paris and Rome. [He discovered](https://www.nature.com/articles/143852a0) induced radioactivity in cobalt and nickel before others had noticed it. **A man with no formal academic pedigree he had, by sheer persistence and experimental acuity, made himself indispensable to a field still defining its own borders.**

When [Sir James Chadwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chadwick) offered him a fellowship in Liverpool in 1939, Rotblat accepted not to climb any scientific hierarchy but because he believed he could one day bring nuclear research back to his beloved Poland. Chadwick’s lab had better tools. He believed that he would bring back those techniques. Then the second world war destroyed everything. His wife, trapped in Poland, was murdered by the Nazis. He would not learn this until after the war’s end.

Rotblat joined the British delegation to the Manhattan Project in 1944. The logic was brutal, and simple: if Hitler got the bomb first, the world would end. The only way to stop it was to beat him to it. But then came the facts. German atomic efforts were rudimentary. The war in Europe was turning. The moral ground beneath the project cracked, and then collapsed, when General Leslie Groves [made a passing comment](https://losalamosreporter.com/2023/07/19/the-real-purpose-in-making-the-bomb-was-to-subdue-the-soviets-now-its-happening-again-on-a-vast-scale-scale-why-july-22-at-fuller-lodge/) at dinner. The real purpose of the bomb, he said, was not to stop Hitler. It was to contain the Soviet Union. The war in Europe was effectively over, and the target had shifted. Groves’ comment clarified what Rotblat had begun to suspect: that the weapon he was helping to build was no longer a shield against fascism, but a tool of post-war dominance. Although many other physicists had conceived of the possibility of an atomic weapon, Rotblat’s early research contributed to its becoming a reality and his later [feelings of guilt](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/joseph-rotblats-interview).

Rotblat, was one of only two scientists, who left Los Alamos.

### The Cure

This could have been his disgrace. Instead, it became his cause.

Back in England, branded by security services as a possible spy, grieving his wife, and missing most of his wartime work, his notebooks had [mysteriously vanished](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsbm.2007.0023) during transit, **Rotblat turned to medicine, a field where radiation could heal instead of harm**.

He didn’t abandon physics. He redirected it. His work on radiation and its biological effects shaped medical diagnostics, cancer treatments, and public understanding of nuclear risks. He developed scanning techniques. He built detection devices. He trained a generation of medical physicists. **It was, by any reasonable measure, a second career, and an extraordinary one.**

But physics alone wasn’t enough. The bomb was still with us and high on his mind.

In 1955, Rotblat helped draft and signed the [Russell-Einstein Manifesto](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/key-documents/russell-einstein-manifesto/), a plainspoken indictment of nuclear weapons. Its logic was unambiguous: humanity faced extinction by its own hand. Scientists, having helped invent the means, now had a duty to avert the outcome. The document ended with a plea:

> **“We appeal as human beings to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest. If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you the risk of universal death.”**

Rotblat did not forget.

### Thinkers Unite

He became the architect of the [Pugwash Conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs), informal but serious meetings where scientists from East and West met throughout the Cold War. They weren’t protests. They weren’t publicity stunts. They were strategy. Many treaties that are now taken for granted, on testing, on non-proliferation, on biological and chemical weapons, trace some thread of origin back to those gatherings, which, over decades, served as crucial backchannels for dialogue when formal diplomacy stalled.

Rotblat made diplomacy possible by building trust where statesmen could not. It was for this decades-long commitment that Rotblat and the Pugwash Conferences were jointly [awarded](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1995/rotblat/facts/) the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995, recognized for their unrelenting efforts to secure nuclear disarmament.

His method was quiet persistence. His philosophy: if you’ve helped build a weapon, you’re obligated to help contain it. And if the governments won’t listen, then the scientists must keep talking, across borders, across ideologies, across decades.

He refused euphemism. Believing nuclear weapons weren’t “strategic assets.” They were suicidal artifacts. In his later years, he expanded his critique: the secrecy of labs, the seduction of military funding, the complicity of peer-reviewed silence. **Scientists were not neutral. Their work had consequences.**

He had many awards, including being [Knighted by the British Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Rotblat#Awards_and_honours), Sir Joseph Rotblat. Even into his nineties, Rotblat remained active, lecturing, mentoring, pushing for disarmament. He lived frugally giving his time and money to his main concern. He donated his Nobel Peace Prize money to the Pugwash cause. He never remarried. Whether this was devotion to his late wife or to the work, or both, he never said.

Rotblat’s legacy is not a formula, not a theorem, not a discovery that fits neatly into a textbook. It’s a question: **what should a scientist do when knowledge and invention makes killing easier?**

Sir Joseph Rotblat gave his answer. He walked away from the bomb and with indomitable determination campaigned for its containment. [Reminding us](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1995/rotblat/lecture/): “The Cold War is over but Cold War thinking survives.”

John Fitzgerald Kennedy famously [said](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527611263.ch35), “One man can make a difference and every man should try.” Joseph Rotblat was the quintessence of Kennedy’s conviction.

The real challenge wasn’t leaving Los Alamos, it was what he chose to do with the rest of his life.

And that is where his greatness lies.
