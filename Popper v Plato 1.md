The philosophical divide between Karl Popper's advocacy for open societies and Plato's ideal of a philosopher-king-led state resonates through the history of Western philosophy. Various philosophers have aligned more closely with either Popper's or Plato's views, including their approaches to governance, the role of individuals in society, and the nature of truth and knowledge.

### Philosophers Aligned with Plato's Views

1. **Aristotle**: Although Aristotle, a student of Plato, diverged in many ways from his teacher, he shared Plato's skepticism about the capacity of the average person to govern. Aristotle favored a constitutional government run by the educated elite, which is somewhat reminiscent of Plato's philosopher-king concept.

2. **Rousseau**: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in some aspects, aligns with Platonic thought. His idea of the "General Will" implies a sort of collective wisdom guiding society, which, while more democratic than Plato's vision, still suggests a unified direction that could be interpreted as similar to the guidance of philosopher-kings.

3. **Thomas More**: In his work "Utopia," More describes an ideal society that, in some ways, reflects Platonic ideals. His vision of a rational, ordered society with a focus on communal welfare and enlightened governance echoes elements of Plato's Republic.

### Philosophers Aligned with Popper's Views

1. **John Stuart Mill**: Mill’s advocacy for individual liberty and his defense of democratic ideals align him more closely with Popper's vision of an open society. His emphasis on liberty, free speech, and the marketplace of ideas echoes Popper's defense of liberal democracy.

2. **Bertrand Russell**: As a critic of dogmatism and an advocate for skepticism and empirical inquiry, Russell's philosophy aligns well with Popper's ideas. He shared Popper's appreciation for scientific inquiry and democratic governance.

3. **Friedrich Hayek**: Hayek's defense of free-market capitalism and his critique of centralized planning place him in alignment with Popper's open society. Hayek's emphasis on individual freedom and skepticism of government intervention resonates with Popper's ideas.

### Hegel's Views and Their Relation to Plato and Popper

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel presents a more complex case. Hegel's philosophy, especially his views on the state and history, influenced a wide range of political ideologies and philosophical movements. He is often associated with the idea of the dialectical process - the thesis, antithesis, and synthesis - which he believed drove historical progress.

- **State as the Realization of Freedom**: Hegel saw the state as the embodiment of rational freedom, a concept somewhat aligned with Plato’s view of a rational, orderly society. However, unlike Plato, Hegel did not envision a society governed by philosopher-kings but saw the state itself as a manifestation of the 'World Spirit' (Weltgeist), realizing freedom and ethical life (Sittlichkeit).

- **Influence on Totalitarian Thought**: Some interpretations of Hegel’s philosophy, especially by later thinkers like Karl Marx, led to a more collectivist view of society, which could be seen as antithetical to Popper's individual-focused open society. However, Hegel himself did not advocate for totalitarianism.

- **Dialectics and History**: Hegel’s view of history as a dialectical process where freedom gradually realizes itself through conflicts and resolutions is a point of contention with Popper. Popper criticized historicism - the idea that history follows a deterministic pattern - which he believed led to totalitarian thinking.

In summary, while some major Western philosophers align more closely with Plato's ideal of a structured, rational society guided by an enlightened elite, others resonate more with Popper's vision of an open, democratic society where individual freedoms are paramount. Hegel's philosophy, with its complex views on the state and history, offers elements that can be interpreted as aligning with both sides, though his ultimate vision differs significantly from both Plato's and Popper's ideals.
