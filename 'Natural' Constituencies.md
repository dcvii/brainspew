The center of gravity of my concern today on [Farai's show](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99249371) was radicalization.

When the producers called me last week and gave the list of topics, I was somewhat disappointed to hear that we were going to talk about two (more) black men who were shot by police. It's a tired old story. One took place in Bellaire, TX which was incorrectly identified by one of the other guests as an 'all white suburb' and the other in Oakland. [I went to Bellaire a couple years ago and it's a largely Asian suburb](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sinh-sinh-restaurant-houston#hrid:hyqB4T_mhEmaGEIvDf6wyw) - a malltown looking very much like those in Southern California's Inland Empire. But you can't stop the old black vs white idea when we run these stories.

The germ of my idea against this assumption of radicalization began when I was listening to Hugh Hewitt take on one of the writers from Slate. Greenwald I think was his name. Anyway he went on about how the residents of Gaza were 'obviously' and 'naturally' going to be radicalized by the excesses of the Israelis. And sure enough this morning, one of the other guests started in with explanations about how this is to be expected in the black community.

But radicalization is not a natural phenomenon. It requires intellectual discipline and leadership. It requires, quite frankly, radicals. These are the *ex parte* individuals who often call themselves 'community activists' who organize protests and hire people with bullhorns to chant 'no justice no peace'. There is always some leader somewhere with a political agenda, fuzzy and ill-informed as it might be, that is behind these riots. I don't want to sound like Richard Nixon, but he was right when he said that there is a silent majority who are always for law and order and they don't ever want to be parts of the mob.  Even giving these radicals the benefit of the doubt as to their peaceful intentions, how do you square their leadership and responsibility to the community when you get [stuff like this](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/08/MN2N155CN1.DTL&feed=rss.bayarea):

The mob smashed the windows at Creative African Braids on 14th Street, and a woman walked out of the shop holding a baby in her arms.

<blockquote>"This is our business," shouted Leemu Topka, the black owner of the salon she started four years ago. "This is our shop. This is what you call a protest?"
<p>
Wednesday night's vandalism victims had nothing to do with the shooting death by a BART police officer of Oscar Grant on New Year's Day - but that did little to sway the mob.
<p>
"I feel like the night is going great," said Nia Sykes, 24, of San Francisco, one of the demonstrators. "I feel like Oakland should make some noise. This is how we need to fight back. It's for the murder of a black male."
<p>
Sykes, who is black, had little sympathy for the owner of Creative African Braids.
<p>
"She should be glad she just lost her business and not her life," Sykes said. She added that she did have one worry for the night: "I just hope nobody gets shot or killed."
</blockquote>

The chances that Nia Sykes is going to vote in favor of candidates who would spend more money on police is slim, but the circumstances around the shooting indicate more money for training is just what's needed to prevent [this kind of thing](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28460948) from happening again. But whether or not police improvement of that particular nature is needed, there is some definite responsibility I think writers and journalists need to take when discussing the reactions of people who assemble into mobs.

I think a number of writers irresponsibly contribute to the radicalization of people through their injudicious use of terms like 'oppression' and their arbitrary recognition as legitimate anybody behind a protest or grievance movement.

This idea follows up the slight opportunity for people to take seriously the idea that Obama changes things. I recognize that people are now giving themselves license to believe things about black people that they never did before. When you get words like this:

He continues his commentary: "We are so comfortable defining black in certain ways, in restricting it to the politics of grievance and lament, that we sometimes do not recognize it when it takes other forms. One is reminded how people used to say 'The Cosby Show' was not black enough and never mind all those cultural signifiers, never mind the anti-apartheid sign on Theo's wall, Cliff's penchant for sweaters from historically-black colleges, all those guest appearances from elder statesmen of jazz and R&B, that episode saluting the 1963 March on Washington. Not black? No, what they meant was, this is not the kind of black we expect, not the black of violence, ignorance, poverty and clownishness."

*Booker Rising response*: As [others](http://www.bookerrising.net/2008/11/panache-report-its-new-day-ignorance-is.html) and I across the ideological spectrum have commented, it's long overdue. The promotion of thuggishness, ignorance, and clownishness as "authentic" blackness is out. Authentic blackness promotes positive culture, about progress and education and staying connected with your family. Stragglers, get in where you fit in and show some class. Oh yeah, young uns, pull up those pants and put on some clothes.

You want to say 'yay' maybe they finally get it. But I think so many Americans have been so pessimistic about race for so long that they forgot what the entire point of change was all about. They kept arguing that black could only be as much as 'subtle racism' would let it be, and completely forgot about the human spirit. So I am likely, when I hear 'how can it be in 2009 that we still have this kind of racism', I'm going to turn that around on the spot. For how can it be 2009 and people still feel limited by it? It is a reductive co-dependence.

Several years ago when I started this blog, one of my axioms was that the Civil Rights Movement is over and the good guys won and nobody is about to turn back the clock. Y'all didn't believe I was serious.

COMMENT: AUTHOR: Chris G EMAIL: [chrisgill73@yahoo.com](mailto:chrisgill73@yahoo.com) IP: 76.17.88.94 URL: DATE: 01/13/2009 01:26:35 AM I used to live in Oakland for the last semester of my junior high (9th grade) year. My dad was the fire chief at Oakland Naval Air Station. Anywho, I saw the clip of the young man who got shot. I have no doubt that it was deliberate. I am just at a loss as to why the cop would pull out weapon and fire it into the ground, for a man handcuffed an on his stomach. He needs to go to prison on murder charges.

As to the rioters... I will call them useful idiots. A government will usually not react to some injustice on their part, without the needed pressure. Especially when it comes to dealing with middle to lower income communities. There is no motivation to do the right thing. And there is always a small segment of our people (as it is with people of all races) who are always easily swayed by the seduction of mob rule or the mob mentality. They only need the justification of the spark (an actual social injustice) to occur, in order for "We're going to show them we ain't playing" mode to initiate. I also saw this effect in a documentary of the LA riots. The rioters turned South Central into a war zone, and looted their own business, shot at fireman coming to put out fires in their communities, and attacked people in their communities. These are people who are inclined to be a**holes, but whose inclination is restricted by the rule of law. If the rule of law breaks down or is compromised, that clears the way.

And I'm sure Brotherbrown can confirm, but I would assume that it was only a small percentage of the population who caused all of the problem in South Central, as is the case in Oakland with this issue. These are also the same people who are causing problems in the community on any given day, or have little interest in building it up. And t always the outside agitator who fuels the flames. Case in point, the Nia Sykes girl referenced in the article. Unfortunately, "radicalization" and "fighting the oppressor" usually results in death, loss of property, and loss of dignity,(WITHIN THE BLACK COMMUNITY ONLY). 

14th Street is in a middle to lower income community in Oakland. Ms. Sykes is from toney San Francisco. Of course she doesn't give an ish if Oakland burns to the ground... she will just hop back on BART and be back in the tranquility (And Safety) of her own predominantly white, upper class community. Most proponents of radicalization and fighting the power usually can be found in similar trappings. They validate their "Blackness" and their contribution to the community by relating to the more base elements (poverty, angst of marginalization, etc) of certain segments of the community.

The most under reported angle of this entire episode is the "Natural Selection" that goes on among many Black people in regards to "Black people being killed".

Some people have a nose that allows them to sniff past the 124 other people in Oakland who were killed last year and instead express moral outrage over this one shooting in which the AUTHORITY killed a Black man. I can accept that the "quality" of the killer being a police man outweighs that of a street thug. However when we cross reference the QUANTITY of Black people being killed an yet not having a "riot" in their honor much less a whimper because an INFERIOR KILLER handed him death - the outrage becomes apparent.

It is my opinion that those who are acting out are treated to a near daily bombardment of shame over the violence that is present in their own communities in which "their people" are held up as violent savages. When they are handed the opportunity to be in judgment of someone who "killed one of their own".....they overreact as a coping mechanism as they hope to counterbalance the equation that has been so long against them. The next time some outsider comes along as queries them about their own VIOLENCE they will point back to the police killing in which "the other side" has shown that they are deadly.

The ironic thing about this Cobb is that in listening to the "Racism Chasers" and their strategy - we hear the names of:

- Amadou Diallo
- Sean Bell
- Yuseff Hawkins
- Abner Louima 
- (sorry I forgot the 5th one)
- and now Oscar Grant

rattled off as the list of Black people killed or beaten by the POLICE and/or an angry WHITE mob during the past 15 years. 

What we DON'T hear these people talk about is how in this same 15 year interval - More than 30,000 Black homicides have taken place.

The VALUE of Black life is accentuated by the KILLER rather than by the intrinsic value that the person has in the view of the operative. 

The worst possible scenario for the tactics of the operative is to have:

- A Black victim
- A Black killer
- A Black dominated Police command staff
- A Black mayor

With the stars aligned as such they will focus on 

- Gun stores
- Gun laws
- International Drug dealers

In summary some Black folks who "Speak Truth To Power" get laryngitis when the "exploitable angles" are outside of the diameter of the "police crime scene tape"

I was very concerned for my son, who was only five years old at the time, and to a lesser extent, my daughter, who was ten. And they both had unpleasant encounters with cops during their high school years that were totally unnecessary, and borne of "thin blue line" mentality.

The LA Uprising is still fraught with rumor and urban legend. Chris G, white kids on the west side near UCLA were looting, hauling off all sorts of merchandise from an electronics store, taking advantage of the fact the all the police resources were concetrated in another part of town, and there was a famous shot of Koreans on the rooftops of a business with rifles, supposedly ready to shoot to kill.

My hometown paper just had a blip on the 123 murders that we had in the city last year. Eighty percent of the victims were black, and 80% of the circumstances leading to the murder were drug related. Only one group routinely marched against the violence, and ironically, the daughter of the group's founder was murdered. It was drug related.

One of the more horrendous murders that took place here last year was of two young women who were handling their jailed boyfriend's "bidness" while they were locked up. One of them was a barista at the Starbucks I used to frequent. Four thugs broke through the door of their shared house and killed them...along with their two babies. The gunmen left the house with a little cash, a few ounces of weed, and a gun. 

I wasn't shocked to see that there was no protest from the community, Jesse and Al didn't show up, and no national media came to discuss the senselessness of the violence or the loss of life. But, let the perpetrator of the injustice no matter how insignificant be white, or a cop, and watch the streets swell with protesters as CNN reports the story 24 hours a day.

The problem is that these fools out here are doing more than selling a little marijuana; it's mostly crack to be exact. A lot them also sell guns, prostitute women, and think of many a way to avoid an honest living in lieu of the quick buck. They took illegal alcohol sales away from gangsters when prohibition ended and they didn't all open bars and liquor stores and go straight that day...they just found some new illegal shit to do.

_"Speaking out to the community?" Is that your approach?_

Speaking out is in fact my approach. When asked how I got where I am, I gladly oblige. I speak with the younger people I meet about life, and try to share what little wisdom I have with them.

If I had the power that Sharpton and Jackson have to draw a crowd, I'd scream the message on every rooftop.

However, I don't have that power.

I derided Sharpton and Jackson due to the circumstances in which they actually show up in outrage or solidarity.

Jackson's anywhere there's supposed racism...and money to be made. Sharpton was there for Sean Bell, there for the so called "Jena Six", and there for a whole host of others whose oppressors were white. Neither are there for those black people that are victimized by other black people. With half of all murder victims being black, they have more than a few chances to stand up and say something.

Classic cooservative diversion.

The fact is that violence is primarily intraracial and most perps and victims are the same race and probably know each other.

And when the perps are arrested, they are prosecuted and do time.

When white cops kill unarmed black men then generally aren't even punished.

Now name me an unarmed white person who was shot dead by cops.

Hell, a few years back a white dude pointed a loaded automatic weapon at the White House and was TALKED into custody.

That's race in America my brutha.

My assumption is that the show got some kind of reprieve because they had announced that it was going off the air, but I guess there's a second chance happening. 

I guess they're stuck with the format, but I'd take the time to get people onto a longer debate and have a one hour version of the Barbershop. Still, I'm generally polite, and there was really nothing controversial to say on that one. I kinda wish I had some of those minutes back myself. Farai didn't look to be herself.

I'm saying that those kind of politics are with us, but that fewer black Americans are going to pay them any mind. So while black conservatives are a convenient target for the opposition you present today, in due time you'll be preaching to the lilies of the field.

What never ceases to amaze me is smugness of you black righties.

Do you really think that if you were in the car with Sean Bell, the cops would have said "Don't shoot. There's a conservatives in there1"?

Do you really believe that Abner Louima was the first or only time an innocent black man had been tortured and brutalized by cops?

The comments to Wickham piece reflect the divisions on this issue that have always existed.

The righties apologize for the cops and deflect to rants about black on black crime.

The progressives realizing that when you have the men in blue comitting public executions that are triggered by race, you have a societal breakdown in the making.

Thirteen percent of the population, yet fifty percent of the murder victims. There's nothing diversionary about that number.

Yes, there's a problem with the cops and minorities, but, there's a bigger problem with black on black crime, and in particular murder. 

All I'm asking is for the powers that can instantly bring forth outrage against any outside body perceived to be a threat to the black community to use that same level of outrage in speaking against those who are the more imminent threat inside it. Instead of destroying folks businesses and looting, go burn down the damn crack house and beat the drug dealers...oh wait, they might get killed doing that.

_Do you really think that if you were in the car with Sean Bell, the cops would have said "Don't shoot. There's a conservatives in there"?_

Put it this way Steve. The club where Sean Bell was shot was a known spot for all kinds of criminal activity. I think Winnie the Pooh said it best, "Where there is honey, there are bees."

Because black are 50% of the murder victims doesn't mean 50% of the black population is engaged in murder.

That number as well is relatively small and pretty much relegated to intramural street violence between inner city thugs.

But that doesn't stop you black righties from racializing violence when the fact is that the majority of black Americans are law abiding productive non violent citizens.

And the main point which seems to skip right over your pointed little heads.

If Grant, Bell etc were white and doing the same $hit, they wouldnm't have gotten shot by the cops.

And of course the cops won't be punished.

THAT's what gets people angry.

Gratutitously attacking Obama is going to look very Uncle Tommish especially after the Bush debacle.

The Republicans really don't have anymore use for you since you don't bring any new black votes with you and instead just represent the same 9% of sellouts and hustlers they've already had in their pockets for 40 years.

You don't have any black Republican elected officials to speak of and I don't see any promising black Republican pols on the horizon.

Wait a second here...8000 black victims of homicide in 2005 and your telling me that it was all street thugs killing each other? Your saying 8000 is a small number? Read up what I first posted. The children of those young girls that got murdered weren't thugs, and 8000 is only a small number when your talking about toothpicks.

_"And the main point which seems to skip right over your pointed little heads._

_If Grant, Bell etc were white and doing the same $hit, they wouldn't have gotten shot by the cops."_

Apparently, if one of the 8000 victims of homicide in 2005 had been white, they might be alive today. Police shootings are minute in comparison to murder. More black people are killed from getting hit by cars than getting shot by cops.

Sheesh...

That's certainly what you suggest with your constant rants about "black on black crime".

In stable middle class black nieghborhoods like mine street violence is not an issue. And what you will find in common with most murderers is that they are young, male, undereducated and underemployed. Far more pertinient factors than their skin color.

"8000 black victims of homicide in 2005"

Where did you get this figure from? Let's a link or evidence. Keep in mind that there are about 20 million black males in America.

"your telling me that it was all street thugs killing each other"

Any law enforcement official will tell you that 90% of the street carnage is intramural carnage between thugs. That's where the spiked numbers in violence among young black men come from.

I live in a 90% black legislative district in Maryland. You know how many homicides we've had in the 8 years I've there? 5, that's right FIVE.

Care to guess why that is?

"More black people are killed from getting hit by cars than getting shot by cops."

Maybe Einstein, but they are not getting hit by cars BECAUSE they are black.

This is easy Steve:

I don't want "Al Sharpton" to do ANYTHING.

The "heaving lifting" needs to be pushed out to the periphery. 

The VERY PEOPLE who CLAIM that they "value Black life" and are rioting for the honor of a Black man who is DEAD because the police murdered him should:

1) Work with their peers to root out VIOLENCE at the bud within their social group

2) BECOME Police Men so that THEY and not "White Cops" are patrolling their own communities. (White cops are welcomed within but if they are the problem - TAKE OVER)

3) Establish a STRONG FABRIC within the community that addresses issues within the wedge that exists between the "drama in a person's household" and before it becomes a "law enforcement" situation

4) Indoctrinate everyone with an "OWNERSHIP" consciousness of their community. 

Steve - if these SOLUTIONS (where is the Anarcho-Capitalist to witness my SOLUTION?) were implemented in our community we'd go far.

Instead - take a look at how this Houston minister is a GOVERNMENT DEPENDENT: [](http://withintheblackcommunity.blogspot.com/2009/01/houston-mayor-asks-black-leadership-to.html)[http://withintheblackcommunity.blogspot.com/2009/01/houston-mayor-asks-black-leadership-to.html](http://withintheblackcommunity.blogspot.com/2009/01/houston-mayor-asks-black-leadership-to.html)

[quote]Mayor White said **solutions to black-on-black violence had to come from the community itself**: "I don't want to be a distraction for people thinking the mayor or the governor or the president-elect can be a substitute for people next door, in the church, or in the classroom."

The Rev. Robert Jefferson, of the Houston Ministers Against Crime, said he was surprised by the mayor's response.

**"We need someone to study the problem. It's getting worse. It's unacceptable,"** said Jefferson, the pastor of Cullen Missionary Baptist Church. **"He helped the victims in Katrina, I guess, because it was a popular thing at the time**, but we have victims on a daily basis. We're a Katrina every day. Our boys are getting killed." [/quote] (Correction - YOUR BOYS are KILLING EACH OTHER!!!!

[quote]The Rev. Robert Gilmore called the mayor's response **"pretty insensitive."** "He needs to make more of a commitment," said Gilmore, founder of Real Urban Ministry Inc. **"We are preachers. We preach on Sundays. We're saying it's over our heads. He's the mayor; he needs to do something."**[/quote]

Some Black folks need to be KEPT AWAY from our people who are most impressionable. Their SLAVE MINDEDNESS is likely to be spread into more people.

I've participated in Stop the Violence marches and vigils attended by hundreds.

However (and this is so damn obvious to me) when you have Policemen aka PUBLIC SERVANTS engaging in executions and unjustified murders, then you have a societal breakdown.

The police are paid to enforce the law, Jackson, Sharpton, and others like them are not. What I'd like them to do has been answered; rally the community to change like they rally the community against everything else.

_"I've participated in Stop the Violence marches and vigils attended by hundreds."_

And there lies the problem...

A vigil attended by hundreds. Let the situation be a cop that shoots or beats someone black and there are **thousands** of people who take to the streets, not hundreds. There are postings all over the black liberal blogosphere, viral emails sent across college campuses, radio interviews, television cameras and reporters, and columnists galore offering their opinion on what happened and making the connection to the alleged continued opression and injustice at the hands of the establishment.

However, let it be the life of an innocent at the hands of another black person and there's nothing. Well, maybe the occasional Stop the Violence vigil attended by a few hundred people.

There are underlying factors that contribute the number of criminals that are out there doing this ish, and what I would like the so called black leadership to do is address those factors. Like the piss poor parenting (or lack there of) these criminals got and the state of the communities that allow this foolishness to continue.

What was funny about the interview that Cobb posted was listening to the young lady that earlier in it said "Bush this, Bush that"; but, when the conversation shifted to talking about her own home city of Baltimore and the horrible shape it's in and the alleged corruption of it's leader, all she could offer was...well...nothing. Why couldn't she come up with a name or names for who might be responsible for Baltimore's decline? Maybe a cause that's at fault? Is the force in which she criticizes Bush equal to the force in which she examines the decline of her city? It's doubtful.

You haven't said anything.

"rally the community to change like they rally the community against everything else"

This is just incoherent ranting.

Sharpton and Jackson don't rally the community to do anything. They are media hustlers plain and simple with no responsibility or accountablity.

They piss you and the white rightwingers you mimic off because they say things you don't like and you can't do anything about it or them but get mad.

"Why couldn't she come up with a name or names for who might be responsible for Baltimore's decline."

Baltimore's decline is due to loss of industry and a middle class tax base.

What do you think it's due to?

This is so fucking stupid it makes me want to scream.

First off you are going on three generations of uneducated, unsocialized children producing children in the inner city. How the hell can you ask someone to be parent when they have no idea what you are talking about and never experienced being parented in a responsible way.

And how do the innocent law abiding people in the communtiy ALLOW criminality? What are they supposed to do.

Or better yet, if you lived in one these besieged neighborhoods, what would you do specifically?

Face down violent criminals?

This really is the kernel of kneegrow conservative stupidity. It addresses "the community" as if it's a context independent object rather than a collection of socially isolated poor folks embedded in and struggling to survive in a hostile encompassing context. 

Repealing the drug prohibition and ending the colonial paramilitary war on drugs (which hasn't proven effective on any front) is the sine qua non of ending drug crime related violence in "the community". Not only that, but in a land of the "allegedly free" - self-medicating and feeling good should be inalienable rights - particularly so long as the exercise of those rights doesn't infringe on the rights of others.

Long, long, long overdue time for there to be a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Narcotics, functioning fairly and uniformly across all 4 domains of protected personal freedom.

EXACTLY.

Another thing these deluded buckdancing popinjays never acknowledge is that when Southern and Eastern Europeans were the inner city poor during the first half of the century the conditions and behavior was very similar to what we see in todays black and brwon ghettoes.

The only reason why today you don't see a preponderance of Pasquales,Isadores or Seamons getting hooked up into the PIC before 20 is these ethnic groups have been thoroughly assimilated into the American mainstream middle class.

Why? Most Black people don't pay attention to them one way or the other. For example, "Jena 6" protest wasn't headed by either man. 

Actually, most times it's not even hundreds. It reaches large amounts when the shootings seem to become a pattern and the fact is, at that point, rallies ARE called for because the police are public servants who may, at that point, be out of control and the actions NEED to be investigated.

_However, let it be the life of an innocent at the hands of another black person and there's nothing_

Just because the media doesn't cover it, it doesn't mean things didn't happen. The fact that you aren't looking doesn't mean nothing is happening.

So-called "Black leaders" don't lead except for the liberal and conservative media who need sound bites and "big bad Negroes" to beat. People like you who place pressure on "Black leaders" know nothing and have no solutions except to point fingers at so called leaders who don't lead and you would recognize they don't nor do they have much affect, if you didn't willfully keep your head up your butt.

BODY:

Dress code strictly enforced. No hats, oversized jeans, baggies or athletic wear. 

There's a new luxury hotel in Las Vegas. It's called Encore and its proprietor is Steve Wynn. I stumbled upon the verbiage looking at his website - he's got a nightclub there called 'Tryst' and he's trying to set the scene. 

Something like 68% of American GDP is the consumer economy. The surest way to get any multipliers via economic stimulus is to give cash to Americans and let them spend it in the normal ways they do - which would include wasting it in Las Vegas. Surely Steve Wynn doesn't need to expand - it's already done. He got the financing he needed for his new resort and casino so the crunch doesn't affect him so much. But if nobody shows, he'll start laying off staff and then the real painful part of the recession will begin. That's the great irony here. If the stimulus package doesn't come before people start getting laid off, it's just going to be welfare - keeping people alive between jobs, which won't come because nothing will have been stimulated, except perhaps pay-per-view. 

Wynn sure picked a bad time to be exclusive. I think a lot more people are going to be wearing denim in the days to come.

The Golden Nugget retains the touch of elegance that is signature Wynn. And the Mirage set the tone for the last 15 years of Strip renaissance 

But Las Vegas is contracting as well. I'm probably on the Strip at least twice, maybe four times a year. Several prominent projects were cancelled over the last several years and there is something ridiculously huge going up between New York, New York and Bellagio called [CityCenter](http://blogs.iht.com/tribtalk/properties/roof/?p=608) by MGM Mirage, that had to cancel a proposed condo portion of the project.  [Here's a list of new stuff](http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-tr-vegasbox15-2008jun15) going on there. I don't see how that many more rooms can come online during these times.

I'll do my part to contribute to the Vegas economy, though I am not a gambler. Show me to the quarter and nickel slots and I'll let a ten dollar bill ride until it reaches twenty or zero.
