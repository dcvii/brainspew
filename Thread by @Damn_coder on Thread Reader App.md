Steve Jobs interviewed thousands of people at Apple.  
  
But he only hired people who answered this ONE question perfectly.  
  
It was so effective that it helped him locate Wozniak, Ive, and Cook before anyone knew their names.  
  
Here's his secret to predicting future legends: üßµ

Jobs wasn't just building a company.  
  
He was assembling a team of visionaries who would revolutionize entire industries.  
  
But finding these people wasn't a matter of degrees, experience, or even skills.  
  
It was about something much more fundamental... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304012748922880/pl/guQdm77gNvZwDKpk.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=1c2&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304012748922880/vid/avc1/480x270/ikBlBnOhse6HJZed.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

His secret weapon? One question:  
"What are you so passionate about that you would do it for free?"  
  
This wasn't just small talk. It was a carefully designed filter to identify a rare trait that Jobs believed predicted future greatness:  
  
Pure, unbridled obsession... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304053068742657/pl/mHFknYCm8IAO2dw5.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=902&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304053068742657/vid/avc1/360x270/QsFP9CuR9Up8mEFO.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304053068742657/vid/avc1/480x360/Q9kQmWA2I86V0g8k.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Take Steve Wozniak for example.  
  
Before Apple, Woz spent countless nights in his garage building computers.  
  
Not for money. Not for recognition.  
But since he couldn't NOT build them.  
  
Problems consumed him. Solutions excited him.  
That's what Jobs was looking for. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304085138391040/pl/8wYbhwh54Yw4XR6x.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=84d&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304085138391040/vid/avc1/360x270/JsEFCmVTjHiBBbtf.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304085138391040/vid/avc1/426x318/3Qh8d0nhKgdBGNbp.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Or consider Jony Ive.  
  
While others saw product design as a job, I saw it as an art.  
  
He obsessed over details that others considered insignificant: the turn of a corner, the click of a button.  
  
Jobs recognized this shared fanaticism for perfection. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304124288057344/pl/KoR6AUm0ZJ0Idlbo.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=0a7&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304124288057344/vid/avc1/480x270/XHwX572HpEZQfAbQ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304124288057344/vid/avc1/640x360/uYwWQO6bIYzdxe3P.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304124288057344/vid/avc1/1280x720/xBs1rAXROrRkEnf_.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Even Tim Cook passed the test.  
  
Where others saw boring supply chains, Cook saw a canvas for innovation.  
  
He stayed up all night redesigning processes that most considered mundane and treating logistics as an art form.  
  
Jobs noticed that obsession created three critical traits: <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304172509941760/pl/qreDTOjOt5R8CfoU.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=00e&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304172509941760/vid/avc1/480x270/pitG0D_enjGcgGip.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304172509941760/vid/avc1/640x360/zODEgbHpizOgLYFF.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918304172509941760/vid/avc1/1280x720/06xQmeV3ckSpW_P6.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

‚Ä¢ Attention to crucial details  
‚Ä¢ Motivation that money can't buy  
‚Ä¢ Tireless perseverance when others give up  
  
These traits were non-negotiable.  
  
And it was this philosophy that transformed Apple's culture.

It was not enough to be skillful.  
  
You had to care deeply about creating products that would change the world.  
  
This attracted other obsessive individuals, creating a feedback loop of innovation.  
  
But Jobs's obsessive filter wasn't limited to products.

It was about finding people who saw the processes as opportunities for revolution.  
  
Who couldn't help but optimize, streamline, and perfect everything he touched.  
  
This mindset is more relevant than ever...

In today's world, the difference between good and great comes down to systems and processes.  
  
The most successful people don't just build products: they also build scalable operations.  
  
They are creating processes that enable growth while maintaining quality.  
  
The lesson?

True innovation isn't just about what you build.  
  
It's about being so obsessed with improvement that you can't help but revolutionize everything you touch.  
  
This is how legends are created.
