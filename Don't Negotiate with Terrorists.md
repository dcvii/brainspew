" *Those who say that Islam is not about war know nothing of Islam.*" - Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeni  
  
Let us recap the past 15 years of negotiating with Iran's regime.  
  
For 15 years of negotiations, Iran has delayed, dragged things out, and continued to advance its nuclear program. In Sep 12, 2023, the US, as a token of good faith for a prisoner swap, released $6 billion of frozen Iranian assets. In response, Iran ordered the Oct 7th Hamas attack on Israel. Today, Iran is once again slaughtering its citizens with its military, paramilitary, and police with efficiency. The outstanding feature of this latest mass murder is that the Trump administration fueled it, and Israel's administration fueled it, and then did nothing.  
  
I warned everyone I could that Trump would do nothing, and if he did, it would leave the mullahs in power, just like after Oct 7th. Here is why.  
  
First, the Trump admin is negotiating with Russia over Ukraine. Russia has used Iran as an ally, and in 2022 and into 2023 was completely dependent on Iran to supply drones that they now produce in Russia. For several months Russia used Iranian troops in Ukraine. Iranian troops were extremely effective---more effective than Russian troops. Russia thought better of using Iranian troops, and sent the Iranians home. So an American incursion into Iran would not be helpful to an outcome Trump wants in Ukraine. But if this was the only reason Trump would probably do it anyway, because Russia's alliance with Iran is realpolitik, not cultural like Serbia, nor is Iran viewed as a matter of Russian survival like Ukraine.  
  
Second, Trump is corrupted through his family. The master of corruption is Steve Witkoff, who Qatar targeted in 2015 when Trump appeared a possible president. Steve Witkoff got $627 million to save his hotel. Since then, Mr. Witkoff has acted as an unregistered foreign agent while being named Special Envoy, by Trump, which is a gray legal area. At every step, Mr. Witkoff advocates for more negotiations. Steve Witkoff arranged for President Trump to visit Qatar where the Emir infamously gave Trump a $500 million aircraft as a gift. Then, Steve Witkoff brought Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr to Qatar where the Emir offered them "business deals". This locked in two family allies with personal access to the president to strengthen Witkoff's hold on Trump.  
  
Third, the US State Department is filled with legacy hires who all believed the "intelligentsia consensus" that negotiation with Iran was the correct course. This group also believe that Islam is no different from any other religion, and that muslim terrorists are just fringe weirdos that do not represent Islam. This consensus has compared muslim terrorists to the Tamil Tigers, which do not represent Hinduism. This active disbelief in Islam as a militant cult is compounded by a belief instilled from neoclassical economics that all people are just economic seekers after fulfillment subject to indifference curves. Like other true believers, any evidence to the contrary is "just a setback". And, for the ambitions of State Department careerists, admitting they were completely wrong is a weakness that will be seized upon to end any chance of advancement. So, the foreign policy "intelligentsia" response to an event like Oct 7th can only be, "Stay the course. Give it time." Readers may add an arch, I-know-better expression here.  
  
Fourth, the US State Department cannot differentiate between nations that will be Islamic quagmires like Iraq, and Libya, from nations that actually will dance in the streets and welcome liberators. The reason for this is, again, that they do not believe that Islam is anything except a mild mannered offshoot of Judaism. Their minds cannot believe in the reality of Islam no matter what evidence is presented because they are stuck in neoclassical and neoliberal fundamentalism. So they cannot do the math on the ethnic-religious composition of the nation. In Iran anti-Muslim is the vast majority.  
  
Fifth, Donald Trump has long been a fan of strategic treachery for personal gain. This was visible on his show, The Apprentice. It is also visible in over 3500 lawsuits and mechanics liens against Trump over non-payment of bills by his businesses. The explanation provided is that all of these plaintiffs, from waiters and subcontractors to attorneys, did substandard work. With anything affecting Qatar, Trump's calculus of personal gain for his family overrides any other factor.  
  
Last, in the book that came out by National Security Advisor HR McMaster, " *At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House*," a picture that emerged was of a man who was wishy-washy on many matters and could be worn down fairly easily. Trump is given to bluster and lack of follow-up.  
  
Let me be clear that I am not anti-Trump most of Trump's foreign policy. I agree with his stance on Ukraine. The Venezuela operation makes sense, cutting off an emerging nexus of nations with interests against the United States, the most concerning of those being Iran's current regime that has a new military drone manufacturing plant in Venezuela. I also follow the arguments on Greenland, an island near-continent, which is part of the North American continental plate. The US has provided most of the funds for infrastructure in Greenland, and Denmark's claim is weak at best. There are serious allegations relative to Danish intentions in the past 50 years toward the Inuit with the Danish IUD program. Like the acquisition of Alaska, Greenland will be looked upon in the future as a wise choice.  
  
However, in the middle-east and relative to Iran, Donald Trump, and every US administration since Jimmy Carter, has been gravely misguided. This is a general feature of the West, also visible in Europe (excepting Hungary and Poland) with migration policies that threaten to topple nations, possibly rather soon.
