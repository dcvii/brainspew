[Disney](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DIS) [DIS \-0.78% decrease; red down pointing triangle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DIS) said it is pulling Jimmy Kimmel’s show off ABC in the wake of remarks the late-night host made about the [killing of conservative activist](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting-utah-valley-university-9c2f9817?mod=article_inline) Charlie Kirk.

“‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ will be pre-empted indefinitely,” an ABC spokeswoman said Wednesday. The suspension begins with tonight’s planned broadcast.

While no return date has been set, Disney is monitoring the situation and sees a path to the show potentially returning in the next several days, according to a person familiar with the situation.

The entertainment company’s move is the latest concession by a broadcaster facing political and commercial pressure over its programming.

What’s News

[![The Wall Street Journal Whats News](https://images.wsj.net/im-915199?height=60&size=1&pixel_ratio=1)](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/whats-news) [Disney Suspends Kimmel Over Kirk Comments](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/whats-news/disney-suspends-kimmel-over-kirk-comments/A6F29A0A-418C-44EC-9B38-35DC8EB8DC13)

Federal Communications Commission [Chairman Brendan Carr](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/brendan-carr-fcc-chairman-3565c857?mod=article_inline)  criticized Kimmel during an interview with conservative political podcaster Benny Johnson Wednesday and suggested the regulatory agency could take action against the broadcast licenses of ABC-owned stations. Owners of some ABC TV stations, including large broadcasters [Nexstar Media Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NXST) [NXST 1.33% increase; green up pointing triangle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NXST) and [Sinclair](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SBGI), told the network they were dropping the show.

A spokesman for Kimmel said the host had no immediate comment.

In his Monday night broadcast, Kimmel, who has often criticized President Trump on his show, said “the MAGA gang (is) desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

“In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving,” he added.

In the broadcast, Kimmel also mocked Trump’s mourning process. “This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish,” Kimmel said of Trump while showing clips of him in the aftermath of the shooting talking about the ballroom being built at the White House.

Kimmel also said Vice President and others in “MAGA land” were trying to capitalize on Kirk’s death.

Trump on Wednesday evening cheered news of Kimmel’s show being pulled. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Trump appeared to encourage NBC to cancel “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” and “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” A spokeswoman for NBCUniversal couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

Nexstar, which owns and operates 32 ABC affiliates in large and midsize markets, said Kimmel’s remarks about Kirk’s death and his followers were beyond the pale.

Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division, called Kimmel’s comments “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse.”

“We do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,” Alford said. [Nexstar plans to seek](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/nexstar-to-buy-tegna-for-6-2-billion-53a01da9?mod=article_inline) FCC approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of broadcaster [Tegna](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TGNA).

Sinclair, which owns and operates 30 ABC stations, also had said it would no longer carry Kimmel’s show. Sinclair called for Kimmel to apologize to the Kirk family and make a personal donation to them and Kirk’s organization, Turning Point USA. The company said it wouldn’t lift the suspension of the show on its stations until “formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network’s commitment to professionalism and accountability.”

Inside Disney and ABC, senior leadership including CEO Bob Iger and co-chairman of Disney Entertainment Dana Walden made the decision to pull Kimmel indefinitely, people familiar with the matter said. Nexstar’s decision to stop carrying the show was among the factors that influenced Disney’s decision given the large number of ABC affiliates the company operates, one of the people said.

Media organizations that have run afoul of the president have faced pressure from the administration, in some cases losing access to news conferences or being subject to probes of some business practices such as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Carr said the agency would be aggressive about going after broadcasters that the FCC deemed weren’t serving the public interest with their news and public affairs programming.

“Broadcast licenses are not sacred cows,” Carr said.

Carr on Fox News Wednesday evening said the late-night shows have been “enforcing a very narrow political ideology.”

“Running a narrow partisan circus—whatever the public interest means, it’s not that,” he added. He said what Nexstar and Sinclair did was “an important turning point.”

Earlier this year, [CBS said it was ending](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/cbs-to-end-late-show-in-may-concluding-decades-long-run-3c93a6b8?mod=article_inline) “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” in May 2026 for economic reasons. The network made the decision weeks after then-CBS parent Paramount Global agreed to pay $16 million to settle a over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President .

Colbert, a frequent Trump critic, called it “a big fat bribe.” The settlement came while Paramount’s merger with Skydance was under federal review.

Certain media critics and some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), said the network was attempting to appease the administration.

Since the election, other media and technology companies have also paid to settle legal actions Trump brought against them.

Last December, ABC [agreed to pay $15 million](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/abc-news-to-pay-15-million-to-settle-donald-trump-defamation-lawsuit-f1b8812d?mod=article_inline) to Trump’s future presidential foundation and museum and $1 million in legal fees to Trump’s lawyer to settle a defamation lawsuit against the network and its anchor George Stephanopoulos.

Some [workers who have been critical](https://www.wsj.com/business/charlie-kirk-death-social-media-post-jobs-0773a8ac?mod=article_inline) of Kirk since his shooting death have been fired.

[Comcast](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CMCSA) called for its staff “to do better” in fostering civil dialogue following senior political analyst Matthew Dowd’s on-air comments on MSNBC suggesting that Kirk’s “awful words” led to his being shot. Dowd is no  [longer with the network.](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/charlie-kirk-shot/card/dowd-no-longer-with-msnbc-after-on-air-comments-about-kirk-ckjUQhDAQMvdt30ueJxu?mod=article_inline)

Newsday apologized after publishing a syndicated cartoon depicting Kirk’s killing that it removed from online platforms.

Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez said, in response to Carr’s threats against ABC Wednesday, that “an inexcusable act of political violence by one disturbed individual must never be exploited as justification for broader censorship or control.”

She said the Trump administration “is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression.”
