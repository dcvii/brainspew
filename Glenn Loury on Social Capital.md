Glenn Loury defines **social capital**—particularly in the context of Black Americans—as the informal, socially‐mediated resources embedded in a person’s family and community background that are essential for acquiring human capital (like skills, knowledge, education, and credentials). This capacity is often lacking in marginalized Black communities due to historical and structural disadvantages.

  

### **📘 Key points from Loury’s definition:**

- In his 1976 dissertation and subsequent work (e.g., _A Dynamic Theory of Racial Income Differences_), Loury wrote that “an individual’s social origin has an obvious and important effect on the amount of resources which are ultimately invested in his or her development,” and introduced **social capital** as “the consequences of social position in facilitating acquisition of the standard human capital characteristics”  .
    
- He argued that **social capital precedes human capital** — informal relationships, community trust, family mentoring, expectations, and social connections shape opportunities and development in ways that formal economic models often ignore  .
    
- Loury coined the term in this specific racial context, to illustrate why equal opportunity laws might not suffice to eliminate income disparities if community-level social capital remains deficient  .
    

  

### **In his own words:**

  

> “An individual’s social origin … has an obvious and important effect on the amount of resources which are ultimately invested in his or her development. It may thus be useful to employ a concept of ‘social capital’ to represent the consequences of social position in facilitating acquisition of … human capital characteristics”  .

  

### **🔍 Why this matters for Black Americans:**

- Loury saw persistent racial inequality not just as a function of discrimination, but as rooted in **structurally inherited deficits of social capital** in Black communities—networks, norms, role models, and familial and cultural resources that support development.
    
- He emphasized that **these informal mechanisms matter more than income transfers alone**; even well-intentioned policies may fail unless they rebuild **social infrastructure** at the community and family level  .

### **Summary Table**

|**Concept**|**Loury’s Insight**|
|---|---|
|**Social capital**|Informal, socially embedded resources from family and community that support human development.|
|**Relation to human capital**|Social capital is a prerequisite enabling individuals to build human capital.|
|**Relevance to race income gaps**|Deficiencies in social capital in marginalized Black communities help explain persistent inequality, beyond what traditional economic models predict.|

In short, for Loury, social capital is about **what people inherit socially—not economically—that shapes their ability to succeed**. It’s rooted in community networks, family structures, expectations, and support—all things that have historically been weakened in many Black communities through structural disadvantage.
