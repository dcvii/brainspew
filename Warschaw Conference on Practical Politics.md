The USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future hosts its annual Warschaw Conference on Practical Politics on January 30, 2025 in Town & Gown at USC. We are honored to join with POLITICO,  PBS’ "Firing Line with Margaret Hoover,"  and C-SPAN to bring together top experts from politics, government, media, and academia to explore the most pressing issues in America’s political landscape. Our panels will explore themes relevant to the 2024 election, including Trump's historic comeback, why Democrats underperformed, how young people see the political future, and what to expect in the second Trump presidency.   
 

This year’s theme is **“The Trumping of America: Why and What's Next?”** Join us in person, on Zoom, or on Facebook on Thursday, January 30 from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. PT. You won’t want to miss this incredible lineup of political VIPs.
