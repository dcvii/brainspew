In _The Culture_ series by Iain M. Banks, Minds—hyper-intelligent AI entities—control ships, habitats, and other large systems. Culture ship Minds are generally classified based on their function, size, and capability. The most commonly referenced classes include:


**1. General Contact Units (GCUs)**
• Medium-sized ships used for general exploration, diplomacy, and engagement with non-Culture civilizations.
• Often have a small crew of humans or drones.
• Example: _The Xenophobe_ (from _Excession_).

**2. General Systems Vehicles (GSVs)**
• Massive ships that serve as mobile habitats, sometimes home to millions of people.
• Essentially small, self-sufficient societies.
• Often divided into subtypes:
	• **Superlifters**: Gigantic versions used for major evacuations or transport.
	• **Limited Systems Vehicles (LSVs)**: Slightly smaller than full GSVs.
• Example: _The GSV Sleeper Service_ (from _Excession_).


**3. Rapid Offensive Units (ROUs)**
• Warships that can engage in combat but also perform strategic and covert missions.
• Extremely fast and heavily armed.
• Example: _Killing Time_ (from _Look to Windward_).
  

**4. Very Fast Pickets (VFPs)**
• Ultra-fast, lightly armed ships used for reconnaissance and fast-response missions.
• A subset of ROUs but more specialized.


**5. Offensive Units (OUs)**
• Less powerful than ROUs but still capable of engaging in combat.
• Rarely mentioned in the books.


**6. Limited Offensive Units (LOUs)**
• Even less powerful than OUs.
• Used for defense rather than full-scale war.


**7. Demilitarized Rapid Offensive Units (dROUs)**
• Former warships that have been repurposed for civilian roles.
• Example: _Falling Outside the Normal Moral Constraints_ (from _Surface Detail_).


**8. Killing Time-class Superlifter**
• A hybrid between a GSV and an ROU, balancing combat and logistical functions. 

**9. Eccentric Ships**
• These are ships whose Minds operate in unconventional or unpredictable ways.
• Often engage in philosophical experiments or bizarre behavior.
• Example: _The GCU Grey Area_ (nicknamed “Meatfucker” for its disturbing habit of scanning biological minds).


These classifications define the different roles ships play within the Culture, but due to the anarchistic and self-determined nature of the Culture, ship Minds often blur these lines by modifying themselves or taking on new roles.
