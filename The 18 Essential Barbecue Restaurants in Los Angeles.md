Los Angeles has arrived [as a barbecue city](https://la.eater.com/22560651/best-barbecue-region-southern-california-maps-restaurants) on the national stage. Gone are the days of overcooked tri-tip and too-saucy ribs. Today’s scene is all about growth and personality, as newcomers mix with longtime barbecue restaurants across the region to create an eclectic, unique moment for smoked meat. Pitmasters are turning to family recipes from across the diaspora for inspiration, while the term barbecue “restaurant” grows to include pop-ups, backyard hangouts, garage setups, and just about everything in between. Here are the 18 essential barbecue restaurants in Los Angeles.

This weekly Simi Valley sensation is part pop-up, part restaurant, and part meme-generating Instagram sensation. Chef Logan Sandoval makes whatever he wants each week, including smash burgers, beef ribs, curry noodles, and smoked housemade Spam musubi. Expect fast sellouts, long lines, and lots of banana pudding for dessert. The address is provided after pre-ordering.

For a glimpse of simple, high-quality barbecue prepared with love and for the local community, come to Swinging Door BBQ. Lightly charred ribs, fatty brisket, and more come off a unique two-forked off-set smoker, and big take-home platters are always available.

For a taste of Tennessee-style barbecue, get to the Memphis Grill in North Hollywood. The restaurant has been turning out delightful pulled pork, brisket, and ribs, and has big plans to grow its menu and restaurant in the future.

With two locations in La Puente and Covina, Domestic BBQ turns out a wide array of smoked meats and other dishes, including burgers, ribeyes, tea-smoked duck breast brisket, tri-tip, and St. Louis-style pork ribs.

Moo’s Craft Barbecue began life as an East LA backyard pop-up before becoming a staple tenant at Smorgasburg. These days the family-run setup operates an always-busy restaurant in Lincoln Heights, serving up impressive brisket and sausage links with LA-specific sides like esquites to match.

Bo Daddy’s puts every ounce of effort into his barbecue. The no-frills operation is designed to get hungry patrons in, out, and wherever they want to eat smoked chicken, spare ribs, and links with sides like mango coleslaw and baked beans. If there’s room left, try the smoked Philly cheesesteak sandwich.

The Cambodian Cowboy is an outright Long Beach sensation, marrying the flavors of his home country with the perspectives of Texas and the produce of California. It’s a heady blend that makes for some of Southern California’s most delicious and unique meals — think tri-tip Khmer sandwiches and heavily spiced ribs. Find pitmaster Chad Phuong around greater Long Beach or at Smorgasburg on Sundays.

Lonnie Edwards is the smiling face behind Ribtown, the daily parking lot rib specialist in Jefferson Park. His off-set smoker, small selling trailer, and a few open-air tables are all it takes to turn out some of LA’s most notable rib tips and beef ribs.

Bludso’s is a local institution turning out reliable Texas-style smoked meats in a sports bar-like environment along La Brea and at a spacious restaurant in [Santa Monica](https://la.eater.com/2023/7/10/23790074/bludsos-bbq-restaurant-opening-santa-monica-compton-pitmaster-kevin-bludso-eater-inside). Co-founder Kevin Bludso is LA barbecue royalty, so it’s no surprise this place still draws a crowd.

Owner Alan Cruz loves to keep his menu and perspective hyper-local with A’s BBQ, the deeply East Los Angeles barbecue specialist. The food is far from traditional and tastier than ever as a result, with rotating items that might include brisket quesatacos, smoked beef cheek, birria sausages, and more.

Maple Block has earned plenty of press over the years, including praise from the vaunted _Texas Monthly_ magazine. With a second location in Grand Central Market, Maple Block continues to turn out barky brisket and tender ribs.

Big, sticky takeaway platters of pork ribs and slices of brisket are the main attraction at Woody’s, a staple Southern spot that’s been cooking in South LA for a generation. Far from the delicate, salt-and-pepper-only Texas-style barbecue, this is a saucy place to get those hands reliably messy. If the Slauson location is packed, head to the others in Inglewood or View Park.

Head into Steve’s BBQ for exceptional barbecue mac and cheese, pulled pork, tri-tip sandwiches, and baby back ribs. This neighborhood spot also has a full bar that cranks out strong cucumber jalapeno margaritas, pineapple martinis, and a Mexican Candy cocktail made with Malibu rum, peach Schnapps, and pineapple juice with spice.

Part sports bar, part late-night patio hangout, part barbecue restaurant of Inglewood’s dreams — it’s hard to pin down the Wood Urban Kitchen because the restaurant can do it all. Swing in for big platters of saucy meats and extra-barky ribs.

Fans travel from across the U.S. for a plate of Kitchen’s Corner superior barbecue, with some standing on the corner of Atlantic and Rose for hours for a taste. The wait is worth it for beautifully smoked meats, including gargantuan dino beef ribs, brisket, and greens.

This family-run Carson restaurant is the place for barbecue with heart. The center of My Father’s Barbeque is chef and pitmaster Shalamar Lane, who presides over a hulking bespoke smoker to make some of the city’s best ribs, hot links, smoked chicken, and more.

The beef ribs are a show unto themselves at this east Long Beach pop-up, but the real flavor comes from the family that runs Axiom Kitchen. As one of the area’s hottest food vendors, Axiom is tasked with feeding crowds that come early and stay late, looking for said beef ribs, brisket, and candied pork belly morsels.

Smoke Queen, a pandemic pop-up sensation turned Smorgasburg vendor, [opened](https://la.eater.com/2024/3/13/24099807/smoke-queen-barbecue-restaurant-garden-grove-orange-county) a brick-and-mortar restaurant in Garden Grove in 2024. Pitmaster Winnie Yee uses a trio of 1,000-gallon steel smokers to prepare signature meats like glazed pork belly char siu, prime brisket smoked over white oak, and gochujang beef ribs on Sundays only.
