### JUST POSTED: November 5, 2025

Recent military developments in the Caribbean have drawn significant attention, particularly following the unexpected resignation of Adm. Alvin Holsey, head of the US Southern Command. After a distinguished 37-year career in the US Navy, Holsey is stepping down one year into his typical three-year tenure, citing legal concerns over US military actions in waters off Venezuela and Colombia.

The tension surrounding these developments is heightened by an unprecedented military buildup in the region. The deployment includes eight Navy warships, highlighted by the recent movement of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean. This strategic concentration of naval assets suggests a massive commitment to counter-narcotics operations and raises concerns about the proportionality of force used against what are mostly small, unarmed boats.

Amidst these preparations, the complexity of any potential US military operations in Venezuela and Colombia is underscored by significant tactical challenges. The Venezuelan military’s mobile air defenses and the logistics of targeting drug production facilities in dense jungles create strategic difficulties. Similarly, the state of the Venezuelan Navy and Air Force presents potential threats that could complicate American operations. Should the US escalate its campaign beyond counter-narcotics strikes to regime destabilization efforts, it could provoke asymmetric responses from the Maduro government, whose grip on power is partly dependent on the narcotics trade.
