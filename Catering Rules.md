I’ll answer for my wife who doesn’t hang out online but has been catering part time for the past 20 years.

Here are some tips I’ve learned by watching.

- Don’t give up your day job. Unless you are an excellent contract negotiator with fancy people who need caterers all of the time, your work will not be steady.
- Work with a partner who is also a caterer, it increases your credibility, it increases your visibility. One person’s skills will be better than the other. For example, my wife is the better cook. Her partner is the better manager and marketer.
- Know your market and specialize so that you can get repeat business from people so your work becomes predictable. That’s the only way word of mouth works for you.
- Know how to hire and fire help. Make sure they are all clean food certified. Knowing how and when to hire and fire help is a make or break skill in catering.
- If you can get regular access to a commercial kitchen, you are way ahead. Chances are, however that your home will become the spot for prep if the venue doesn’t have that. Buy a freezer and an extra fridge. You’ll take up half the garage with your gear. Know this way ahead of time, especially if you’re married.
- Don’t take cheap customers and don’t serve cheap food. If it looks like picnic food, everybody will wonder why bother with a caterer. Remember they may decide this at the event and try to renegotiate.
- Don’t put music or entertainment on your catering budget. Make it separate.
- Don’t take last minute customers. You need 2 weeks at a minimum.
- Don’t do business with people you wouldn’t want in your home. You cannot fake a smile through a whole catering, and plenty enough things will go wrong anyway.
- Don’t give discounts to charity organizations, they will fleece you and question your morals if you charge them normally. Be very clear about that up front.
- If you are charging on a per-plate basis and expect the guests to pay, make sure you have a full time cashier and that you can take credit & debit cards. Make sure they can handle any complexity - a bank teller would be a good person.
- Take as little responsibility for the venue as possible. Preparing, serving and cleaning up food is exhausting enough. You don’t want to be unloading and loading tables, chairs & tents before and after the event.

Hmm. I knew more than I thought. Only because I’ve seen what goes wrong when such advice is not followed.
