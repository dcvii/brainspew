Anduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.

Anduril’s Analytics team is focused on modeling our internal data into reusable entities that generalize how Anduril operates. From those entities we build workflows, dashboards, and metrics that drive better and faster decision-making. You will work with stakeholders from across the company to understand how Anduril functions and model our data to create the digital twin of our operations.

**Who you are:**  
We’re looking for people who love ontologies - defining domains and writing the code that puts those models into action. Ideally you are passionate about the next generation of defense technology and love building efficient and understandable data models. You prioritize velocity and are interested in pushing the frontiers of what analytics can do within an organization - think data applications rather than just dashboards.

**You will:**

- Lead the building of Anduril’s ontology for a specific domain such as Finance, Supply Chain, Manufacturing, People, and Sustainment
- Collaborate with stakeholders, collecting requirements, and writing the code that results in Secure, Timely, Accurate, Trusted, and Extensible Data Models
- Seek out problems that can be solved with data and proactively work with the organization to make it a reality
- Become a trusted resource for Anduril leadership in helping them run their organizations more effectively

  
**You will love this role if you have:**

- 5+ years of experience in an analytics focused role - Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer or Analyst / Consultant with a strong engineering background
- You are motivated by our mission. We are working to solve the biggest problems in defense
- Your weekend reading usually involves authors named Kimball or Inmon or modern data modeling blogs
- You’re energized by business impact & a self-starter: you’d rather build an imperfect data model quickly that is used by many people than a perfect data model that collects dust
- You thrive in cross-functional projects that have a heavy combination of technical requirements and user-focused workflows
- Expert with SQL and experience with Python or other programming languages
- Experience with data stack tools: dbt, Redshift, Looker/Tableau, Palantir Foundry
- You are empathetic: you are eager to see the world from your users’ perspective
- U.S. Persons status is required as this position needs to access export-controlled data

**Preferred Qualifications**

- Ability to obtain and hold a U.S. Top Secret security clearance.

We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities.

To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.
