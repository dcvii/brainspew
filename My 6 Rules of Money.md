I recently watched an interview with a pro athlete—and you might envy him. Not long ago, he retired at age 32 with a net worth over $100 million.

The interviewer asked him what it felt like to walk away in the prime of his life with so much money.

His response: “Miserable.”

> **Interviewer:** “Really? You were miserable?”
> 
> **Athlete:** “Yeah.”
> 
> **Interviewer:** “Huh? I didn’t expect this answer.”

The athlete explained that he had discovered meaning and purpose in his life around age 6 or 7. It came from sports.

From that moment on, sports gave him goals. Sports provided him with discipline. Sports offered him camaraderie and teammates who worked together in a common cause.

Every day, he had a regimen—both during the season and the off-season. He took pride in his improvement, and how he fulfilled his responsibilities to coaches, teammates, fans, and especially to himself.

Even the sacrifices felt good. He didn’t go out partying. He avoided alcohol. He kept distractions to a minimum. This all contributed to the greater purpose—and happiness—of his life.

Then it all went away at age 32.

Nothing could fill the gap. Every day he confronted the emptiness—and wondered what he could find to replace what he lost.

“I had to figure out how to be busy…..I spent a year just driving in traffic.”

He would get into his car and drive with no purpose or destination—just to fill up the hours on the clock. He put 30,000 miles on his car in a single year, even though he had no place to go.

But, of course, he had his $100 million. That should make him very happy?

Not at all. And now we get to the key reality of money.

This is important stuff. You won’t hear about it in any of those Super Bowl commercials—but it’s far more important than anything those marketeers are peddling.

“What do I spend it on?” he asked. “Do I go to the fucking mall? How many malls can we go to?’

Let’s say he buys a new pair of running shoes at the mall? Or maybe he buys a *dozen* pairs of running shoes? Or a *hundred*.

Will that improve his life in any meaningful way?

The same is true of the clothes he could buy at the mall. And the jewelry. And the fancy watches.

The watches are the most ironic purchase of them all. They remind him of all the hours that now pass by without meaning.

That’s the bottom line: There are a million things you can buy at a shopping mall—and some are nicer than others. But none of them will contribute to your life in any significant way.

It’s far more valuable to have a sense of who you are—a purpose, a meaning, a mission, a life.

You are already far ahead of the game, if you have found your vocation, or *calling* ( a lovely term), or some other meaningful life’s work.

So if you’re a creative person with a passion for your art form, you already have an edge here.

It’s even better, if you’re part of some larger community—a family, or team, a band, a neighborhood, a congregation, or some other group of this sort.

Consumerism can never replace these. It’s at best compensation, and an inadequate one.

At this juncture, you might be surprised when I say that I often tell young people to take money very seriously.

The people who ask my advice are typically musicians or writers—or involved in some other creative pursuit. And they are often shocked when I speak bluntly about money.

Artists are supposed to ignore it.

That’s why their teachers never talk about it. You can spend four years getting a degree in music or creative writing or studio art, and nobody will give you a straight story about earning a living.

Or if they do mention it, they make crazy statements. Such as “Do what you love and the money will follow.”

I’m sorry, but that is demonstrably false.

I’ve met countless creative people who did what they love, and struggle to pay the bills. I often share links to their GoFundMe campaigns when they have medical emergencies or other unforeseen debts.

They did what they loved, and suffer for it.

The reality is that even artists need to worry about money. They need to pay the bills, and put food on the table.

So I encourage young people in the arts to develop some other job skill, outside of their creative vocation. [I often point to the example of composer Philip Glass](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-blue-collar-jobs-of-philip-glass), who supported himself, for many years, as a plumber, taxi driver, and crane operator at a steel mill.

Glass didn’t focus full time on music until age 42.

My life story is similar.

I come from a working class family—my dad was a servant for many years and my mother worked as a telephone operator. Needless to say, I had no trust fund.

And I married another creative professional. My wife Tara pursued a vocation in modern dance—arguably even less lucrative than my jazz work.

Of course, my brother Dana faced the toughest situation of any of us. He wanted to be a *poet*. That’s just asking for a life of starvation in a hovel.

So we all developed other skills.

That was a good thing—and not just for the money. It made us stronger, more resilient, more capable. I am better at creative work today because of [all the difficult things I had to do](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/how-i-became-the-honest-broker) to pay the rent.

So I tell young creatives to take money seriously. But *never* let it rule your life.

Never! Never! Never!

I can’t emphasize that enough.

When I was in my twenties, I got to know one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. And he was very curious about my life choices.

I think he respected my unusual lifestyle. But it also puzzled him. So he often asked me about what I was doing and why.

> ### He stared me down and demanded: “How much money do you think you need to be independent?”

In particular, he wanted to know why I was teaching jazz (at that juncture) when I had an MBA from Stanford’s business school. Surely there were more lucrative ways to earn a living?

I replied that I have no issues about making money. I think it’s fine—provided you don’t do anything unethical or harmful.

But I have little interest in *wealth*. For me, the purpose of money is *independence*.

That didn’t satisfy him. How can you even achieve independence? Don’t you need a lot of money just to be independent?

“No, not at all,” I replied.

At this point, he stared me down and demanded: “How much money do you think you need to be independent?”

I never got a chance to answer his question, because his wife cut him off at that point. She thought he was getting rude in asking me these personal questions.

“He doesn’t need to answer that,” she announced—and gave a reproving look at her husband. “I’m sure he needs a lot less than you,” she added, with an acerbic tone.

That was the end of our conversation about money.

> ### You will be happier if you put your faith in something bigger than bling.

I thought it wise to change the topic before a husband-and-wife tiff developed. But I would have liked to explain more.

As a single man in my twenties, I didn’t need much to consider myself independent.

I’d found an inexpensive apartment, and shared costs with roommates. My share of rent was $300 per month. Even in those days, that wasn’t much. I probably spent an equal amount on food and basic household items.

The bottom line: I could get by comfortably on less than a thousand dollars per month.

My income fluctuated. Sometimes I made a lot. Sometimes I made a little. But I always had enough.

That’s the one thing I possessed that even my wealthiest friends lacked. *Enough.*

I’ve always had rookie numbers.

I’m certainly no ascetic or miser. I don’t try to live as a stoic or full-blow ascetic. I live comfortably today. But I still value money for independence, not consumption.

That’s a healthy attitude for creative people.

Independence will give you freedom to create. And it’s still possible to buy independence on a tight budget. That’s a better deal than any of the consumer goods sold at the mall.

How do you do it? It’s simple enough. You just need to ignore the intense consumerist mentality of modern society.

But here’s the key thing: That’s really is no sacrifice. You will be happier if you put your faith in something bigger than bling.

Let me sum this up. Here are the six rules:

This should be obvious, but you won’t find that truth in any economics textbook. Economists believe one dollar is always equal to one dollar—but believing that is a dangerous mistake.

Useful purposes for money include food & shelter, medical care, education, personal development, charitable endeavors, creative expression, etc. Destructive purposes include gambling, addictions, and all the other false paths out there.

This is why true creatives have an advantage. They already operate with a higher purpose. But there are many ways to pursue a purpose-driven life.

It’s usually a compensation for something else lacking in life. When pursued to excess, it clearly indicates a lack of higher meaning or purpose.

You can’t maximize wealth unless you really understand what constitutes it. This is the chapter that’s always missing from the econ textbook.

That’s why I take money seriously, but still warn people against giving it too much control over their lives.

This is how you get rich on the cheap.

The genuine riches in the 21st century can’t be found at the Nike Store or Apple Store. And if you’re a creative person, most of those treasures are within—at least that’s where they start.

But that’s true for everybody else, too. We’re all creatives, in some sense. At a minimum, we create our own lives.

Although you can’t buy the greatest treasures, you can nurture and develop them.

If you haven’t (yet) found your pathway, make that your priority. The mall can wait. It will always be there.

And, when you finally find the actual sources of wealth—and I wish you all the best on that important journey—you just might realize that you don’t even need the mall at all.
