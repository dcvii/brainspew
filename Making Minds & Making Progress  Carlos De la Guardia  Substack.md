### We can accelerate forever, yet never hit a wall or singularity

Far from causing a ‘technological singularity’, progress can be both exponential and quite manageable.

For one thing, many dramatic improvements require zero effort from those who will benefit (like with faster communication, shipping, computers, etc.) This is no accident, of course. When a company creates a new product, they must make it easy to use, and take advantage of customers’ existing behaviors and expectations.

Also, human minds can perform many creative feats without any conscious effort. We can walk up stairs without having to think about it, even if they’re unlike any set of stairs we’ve seen before (e.g. a different color, height, surface texture, etc.)

So, while many improvements require no direct behavior changes at all, many more require only imperceptible ones, like adjusting to a slight change in stairwell design. It turns out that billions of people can adapt to thousands of changes over the course of a year, and never be overwhelmed by any of them. A single trip to renew your driver's license can cause more angst than riding this exponential wave.

Having said that, not all changes are imperceptible or effortless. Some are difficult and frustrating, but I think these are the exception.

And one has to distinguish between those \*make\* the improvement and those who \*use\* it. Using an improvement requires many orders of magnitude less effort than making it. So, while one person spends years creating a new technology, millions can take advantage of it within moments, potentially.

### And are prime numbers rare?

If there are infinitely many ideas, and infinitely many good ones, then... there's just an infinity of both. So, if both sets are countably infinite, then they have the same size. Good ideas aren't rare in that sense.

Ditto for prime numbers. There are infinitely many of those too, and infinitely many integers. So, there are as many primes as there are integers. Prime numbers aren't rare in that sense either.

However, that's only true if you talk about primes and integers in the abstract.

If you look at the number line, primes do get rarer. And, if you alter primes using familiar operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing), you almost always break the prime, turning it into a non-prime (aka "composite") number.

There's no number line for ideas, but you can talk about altering good ideas in familiar ways (adding, subtracting, switching parts of it), and this usually breaks the idea, turning it into a non-good (aka "bad") idea.

So, in this sense - perturbation by familiar operations - primes and good ideas are rare. Or, not "rare", but easy to break. As David Deutsch would say, they're hard to vary.

Actually, good ideas are rare. There may be infinitely many of them in the set of all ideas, but consider a different set: the set of variants. In that set, good ideas are indeed rare.

There may be infinitely many ways to design an excellent computer, but most ways of changing a good design will just break it.

Maybe yet another way to put this is: good ideas aren't rare, but good variations or alterations are rare.

### Zooming out from one thought to all possible thoughts

When thinking about the mind, it's helpful to consider five nested sets, where each one is a subset of the next:

Active ⊆ Existing ⊆ N-Reachable ⊆ ω-Reachable ⊆ Possible

1\. **Active**. The set of things currently active in the mind. This is usually a tiny set, focused only on what's relevant at any given moment. The fact that we can focus like this helps us solve problems more efficiently than just trying things at random.

2\. **Existing**. All the knowledge in the mind. Many of these things haven't been used in years, but they're in there, and might be used if they suddenly become relevant. Ideally, you'd have vast knowledge, and know exactly when to use each thing - when it should become active.

3\. **N-Reachable**. All the knowledge you don't yet have, but might reach in N steps. e.g. All the things that are one thought away, say. The point here is that many things are just a few thoughts away. Also, if your mind contains good ideas, then many improvements might be just a few steps away.

4\. **ω-Reachable**. All the things you can ever reach, given unlimited time and resources. The point here is that the human mind might be able to create any thought, while AIs or raccoons might never reach those things, even with infinite time. (The symbol ω is "omega" and refers to infinity.)

5\. **Possible**. All the things that are possible in reality. Some systems can do all these things - perhaps we humans can. If the set is finite, then there is a best possible state, and things can never improve after that. If the set is infinite, then perhaps things can get better forever.

### It doesn't just subtract. It adds.

“Compression” of information is never just a reduction or loss.

It’s creation and discovery. You construct an alternative way to represent or approximate a thing, often using new building blocks that aren’t even in it.

e.g. 10101010101010101010 can be compressed as: “10” x 10.

Note that the original doesn’t contain quotes “” or mathematical symbols like x.

In other words, you didn’t merely throw out some of the original, but added new things it never contained, like a notion of multiplication or repetition.

Likewise, when we “compress” the complexities of the world, we aren’t just throwing out large parts of it because it’s too much to handle. We are introducing new, powerful ideas it never contained.

### They have a hidden hyperflexibility

We use computers all the time. We talk to people all the time. From an everyday perspective, all these things are normal. But, from another perspective, each is colossally complex and significant.

*Computers are unlike every other machine.* We routinely use or create new software. That is, we get a machine which we bought years ago to do something new - only thought of yesterday. That's like buying a car, and then years later, easily getting it to bake a cake, because it turns out that it can do that too, oddly enough.

*And people change.* Radically. Like a computer, it turns out they can speak one language, and later learn another. While "personality" may seem consistent over time, you have almost zero ability to predict the details of what a person will be thinking and doing in a year, or in a day. That's unlike every other organism. A squirrel doesn't eat acorns today, then open YouTube to learn a recipe, and cook acorn pie tomorrow. It's acorns all day, every day.

Computers and people are weird, weird, weird, and for much the same reason. *They have a hidden hyperflexibility.*
