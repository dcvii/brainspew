- Alphabet and Meta paid about 10-15 basis points to place bonds, investors demanded sizeable new-issue premiums, and U.S. investment-grade credit spreads ticked up in recent weeks, Janus Henderson said.
- Investors are growing uneasy that AI-related debt could strain the U.S. corporate bond market and dampen tech stocks, as Larry Hatheway noted \`there are doubts that have emerged in the last few weeks around the AI spend story\`.
