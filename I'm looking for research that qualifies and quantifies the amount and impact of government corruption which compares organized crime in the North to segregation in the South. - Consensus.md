	## Government Corruption and Organized Crime: Quantification, Impact, and Regional Comparisons
	Research has extensively examined the relationship between government corruption and organized crime, particularly in the context of the Northern United States (e.g., Chicago) but offers little direct comparative analysis with Southern segregation-era corruption.
	## Quantifying and Qualifying Corruption in Organized Crime
	Studies of Chicago's organized crime reveal that corruption is deeply embedded within political and law enforcement structures. Before Prohibition, police were more numerous in organized crime networks, but politicians, though fewer, held more central roles. During Prohibition, as organized crime became more profitable and centralized, politicians maintained high embeddedness, while law enforcement's role diminished. This suggests that as criminal profits rise, corruption becomes more concentrated among higher-level officials, with everyday corruption being more frequent but less embedded in less profitable contexts .
	In Italy, regions with higher organized crime see about 10% of public expenditure embezzled, which negatively impacts economic growth. In contrast, regions with lower organized crime experience less embezzlement and positive economic effects from public spending . This quantification highlights the significant economic cost of corruption linked to organized crime.
	## Impact of Corruption and Organized Crime
	Corruption and organized crime undermine the rule of law, economic performance, and public trust in government. They create environments where state institutions are compromised, leading to social disintegration, poverty, and weakened governance . The collusion between organized crime and state officials is particularly damaging, as it blurs the line between legal and illegal activities and erodes the quality of government .
	## Regional Comparisons: North vs. South
	While the literature provides detailed analysis of organized crime and corruption in the North (e.g., Chicago, Italy), there is a notable lack of direct comparative research with the Southern United States, especially regarding the impact of segregation-era corruption. Most studies focus on the mechanisms and consequences of corruption within organized crime, rather than contrasting it with other forms of systemic corruption such as that associated with segregation.

	| Region/Context | Corruption Mechanism | Quantified Impact | Citations |
	| --- | --- | --- | --- |
	| Chicago (North, US) | Political/law enforcement | Politicians highly embedded; shift during Prohibition |  |
	| Italy | Organized crime & public sector | ~10% of public expenditure embezzled in high-crime regions |  |
	| General (Global) | State-crime collusion | Undermines rule of law, economic growth, public trust |  |

	## Summary
	Research robustly documents the quantification and impact of government corruption linked to organized crime, especially in Northern contexts. However, there is a significant research gap in directly comparing these dynamics to the corruption associated with segregation in the Southern United States.
