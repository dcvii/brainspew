### Basic mechanics.

I am focusing on Boxtag instead of the bigger XRepublic, as I am guessing that funding is going to take some luck and time to procure, duh. Nevertheless my design and prototypes are coming along. In fact, the logic of this is deceptively simple. So once I get it working into a nice API library, I should be able to make it very easy for web developers to embed the goods into a wide variety of CMS, blog and comment sections everywhere.

I have also spec’d out a bunch of other dimensions. Still it makes the most sense to use only four at a time. So in the future we should be able to configure, any combination of the 17 spec’d dimensions for a site’s custom boxtag.

I expect this interface will be client-side heavy and send a light data package back for analytics and that part will be fairly sweet. I can probably run the whole thing in WASM even though I don’t know how to. Then again, I don’t know Flask either, and what you see above is Flask and Bootstrap. Thanks Claude.
