Christianity has been working to combat sin for over 2000 years. Guess what?

When you can get tens of millions of people into thousands of buildings around the world to meet on a weekly basis and all repeat the same oaths for hundreds of years, get back to me on that racism eradication.

In the meantime, you can clean up yourself and set a good example. That’s how all goodness starts. It’s really enough. Race is a lie. Don’t internalize it. Don’t eat the poison. Don’t stick your finger in the socket. Simple.

Evil in the world is permanent. It is in your heart. It is in everyone’s heart. It is the nature of mankind. In order for people to work together, they have to WORK TOGETHER. That doesn’t mean walking around in circles shouting slogans with a sign over your head. It means serving and addressing the needs of other human beings. So what have you dedicated your life to doing?

Everybody wants to get rid of evil. It’s not a new idea. You get no credit for wanting things to be better. Everybody wants things to be better.

I tell you what. I’ve been answering race questions online on and off for about… hmm oh. let’s say 20 years. And I’ve probably read 50 books on the subject. And for me, that’s just a part time thing I’ve done in my spare time. I am sure I have answered this particular question 100 times, and maybe 100 different ways. I’m pretty good at it, but there are literally years that go by that I get sick to death of the questions and I don’t answer any. I tell people to piss off and figure it out themselves. And I really don’t care if they do or not. But every once in a while I am inspired to do the work, the best work I’ve ever done, and right now I am because I’ve learned something new that gives me a whole new perspective on the same thing I’ve been working on.

So this year it’s alarmingly simple. Psychology.

Psychology is the science that explains how people’s minds work, how they figure things out, and how to measure this. It depends on theories of mind and consciousness and a whole lot of stuff that’s really vague to me now because I haven’t read any serious books on the subject, yet.

Now since I’m a programmer by trade (in fact, I’m a senior data architect / scientist with 30 odd years in the business, or some fancy crap like that) I have spent many decades learning how to represent knowledge that shapes the way people think when they work with computer systems. That’s the TLDR version of what I do. So I understand from experience how people deal with, let’s call it ‘knowledge formation’, as they interact with computer systems designed to assist in that process.

I understand logic. I know for a fact how racism can be logical and yet untruthful. I understand how people fall for fallacies and fail to see outside of regimes of truth. I understand how it requires energy to sustain beliefs. And of course I understand multidimensional data modeling - so I know what statistical factors make sense and which do not. And why. I’m a really good analyst. I know how to get to the heart of logical principles and make all of the implications clear. That’s my talent. Well, one of them anyway.

All that leads to a sound philosophical logical testing framework for recognizing faulty and deceptive reasoning. And that has been part of my approach to debunking racial theories. But I also understand that (and this is important) Americans don’t often ask about how other countries and other historical periods have dealt with similar problems. Americans know ‘slavery’ as American slavery before our civil war among Africans in the South.. blah blah blah. And people are always trying to make points in a very narrow context of blame and responsibility blah blah blah.

But what if I told you that just like there are a few scientifically provable blood types by which nobody in America is judged, there are scientifically provable psychological features by which nobody in America is judged. Lots of people who know jack about genetics will bloviate on an on about heritable IQ, as if they understood gene expression or even how chromosomes work, or which ones are involved in intelligence. But when is the last time somebody told you. “My blood type is O+, that’s the majority on the planet.” I’m the majority, if you’re not O+ you’re the minority. Well it’s because what, because race is not really defined so well, but that’s not the point of supporting a racial theory, just that you can make ‘reasonable’ judgments about race and culture and ethnicity and point to crime statistics or SAT scores or other trivial nonsense, that might represent 1 or 2 or 3 events in some individual’s entire life, and say that explains society. Yeah right. Race only explains your willingness to think about race. And believe me, people are really colorstruck over some meaningless crap right now, yet they think they know something.

But it is interesting to me to look at human psychology which has evolved over millions of year through natural selection and understand not as a humanist desire or platitude but with scientific accuracy to say that human behavior works a very particular way which is as inevitable and unavoidable as blood type. And it works exactly the same way in all humans. In all countries. In all of history. In all societies. In all cultures. In all economies. In all religions. Because that is biologically what it means to be human and to think. And yes of course across all races, languages, governments too. So at some point in the future, some jackhole will say ‘race explains this’ or ‘racism is the cause of this’, and I’ll immolate their rats nest thinking with psychological precision. Hmm. My typing fingers get tingly just thinking about the troll destruction.

Can you hear the excitement in my writing? I’m about to climb another mountain of learning to add to what I know. I expect it to be useful. Not just so I can answer another question about race online among strangers, but to understand human beings better. But yeah I get to make this old tired hobby have a new twist. Plus it answers questions about religion and philosophy and learning and other things as well. A whole new slew of stories and concepts like the Marshmallow Test. Fun for me, maybe exciting for my readers.

Anyway. Nobody is going to solve world peace, or world sin, or world racism. The Romans tried. The Mongols tried. The Ottomans tried. The British tried. ISIS is still trying. You know how that song goes. Everybody wants to rule the world.

Rule yourself. Find a mate. Rule your children. Be at peace with yourself, your mate, your children. Try not to sin. It’s harder than it sounds. But you can do it with sacrifice and love. That’s enough. If you sacrifice and love right, you’ll be right. Avoiding racism is as easy as avoiding spinach. You don’t have to be paranoid that some evil cabal has Popeye terror cells hidden around the world. You don’t have to have sophisticated strategies for combating spinach on a global scale. That’s for geeks like me. But even I’m not fool enough to think I’m on a moral crusade of epic proportions. I’m a writer, just answering questions the best way I know how. And I’m happy and I’m at peace with myself, and I try not to sin.

And so good night to you, sir. Peace.

The current growing levels of tribalism and isolation will surely lead to greater inhumanity, which a I agree is tragic. To attribute it to evil is sentimental nonsense, it is simply our reaction to the perceived loss of control and agency over our lives. Unless you happen to know of a passing messi…
