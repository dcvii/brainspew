In recent ICE raids in California, what is the estimate of number of arrests and deportations?

Recent ICE raids in California, particularly in the Los Angeles area, have resulted in varying estimates of arrests and deportations based on available data up to July 2025:
- Arrests:
	- Between January 20 and February 2, 2025, ICE reported 8,276 arrests nationwide, with a significant portion occurring in California, though exact figures for California alone are not isolated in this data.
	- In a specific operation from May 4 to May 10, 2025, ICE arrested 239 individuals in the greater Los Angeles area.
	- From June 6 to June 22, 2025, 1,618 immigrants were arrested for deportation in Los Angeles and surrounding Southern California regions.
	- During the first 10 days of June 2025, 722 arrests were reported in the Los Angeles area, with more than half having no criminal history.
	- Over the July 4th weekend in 2025, posts on X claimed over 1,600 arrests in Southern California, though this lacks official confirmation.
	- On a single day, June 6, 2025, 44 people were arrested across Los Angeles, prompting protests.
- Deportations:
	- Specific deportation numbers are less clear. One report noted a man arrested at a Home Depot in Los Angeles on June 6, 2025, was already deported to Mexico by the same day.
	- Broader data indicates ICE carried out an average of 43,000 deportations per year from the U.S. interior between FY 2020-24, but recent California-specific deportation figures are not detailed.
	- The Trump administration’s goal is to scale up to 3,000 arrests daily, which could lead to increased deportations, but exact numbers for California post-June 2025 are unavailable.
Analysis: The data suggests thousands of arrests in California, with Los Angeles as a focal point, but deportations are less frequently quantified in recent reports. Many arrested are held in detention facilities like Adelanto, awaiting removal proceedings, which can delay deportations due to immigration court backlogs (3.6 million cases pending as of October 2024). Estimates vary, and some sources note that less than 10% of those detained recently had serious criminal convictions, indicating a broader sweep than the administration’s “worst of the worst” narrative. Official ICE reports and advocacy groups often conflict, with the latter claiming many non-criminal immigrants are targeted.Limitations: Precise deportation numbers for California in 2025 are scarce, as most reports focus on arrests. X posts provide anecdotal claims but lack verification. For the latest figures, check ICE’s official releases on [www.ice.gov](http://www.ice.gov/) or monitor advocacy group reports like those from the Immigrant Defense Project.
