A very left-leaning friend recently recommended to me Nick Lands' book Fanged Noumena. After some quick online research, he seems to be very right-wing, and his work tends to promote scientific racism and Fascism. I'd rather not spend the money on someone who believes in these things if that is the case. Does his earlier work revolve around these ideas? Are his philosophical ideas even worth reading? Or is his previous work similar to Deleuze, where it is more focused on left-wing acceleration? Thanks.

> Nick Land is a British philosopher, formerly holding a position at the University of Warwick, and being part of the first wave of anglophone Deleuze and Guattari commentators (along with his English and American contemporaries such as Keith Ansell-Pearson and Eugene Holland). Fanged Noumena (FN) is a 2011 semi-complete collection of his oeuvre, ranging from his dissertation at the University of Essex in the late-80s to the inception of his post-academia blogging in the mid-00s. The bulk of what is presented in FN occurred in the 90s, during his time as a lecturer at Warwick. The essays within are predominantly concerned with interpreting and analyzing the work of Deleuze and Guattari, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Kant, Spinoza, Freud, Marx, Heidegger, and the cybernetics of mathematician Norbert Wiener. Through these figures, various metaphysical, ontological, and epistemological issues are interrogated. If this interests you, perhaps he is worth reading. Alternatively, since your friend recommended it, I'm sure they could answer to what they see as analogous between yourself and what is presented in FN.

> As for "left" and "right" accelerationism, I am doubtful that these are useful terms, as there doesn't seem to be any semblance of a formal definition for at least ten years after the majority of the publications in FN. If by "Left Accelerationism" we mean what was built out of the blogs of Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams in the late-00s, I do not believe Land could be referred to as such. As for apprehension about his contemporary predilection towards "racist" and "fascist" ideas you'll have to look elsewhere, since the evaluation of such concerns falls outside the purview of what is collected in FN (specifically because most of these concerns arise post-2011).

My only addition to this is to say that his most recent work “crypto current” seems to take a trajectory off of a supposed z/acc approach to his previous work, with a refreshed sense of nihilism, or perhaps more appropriately a “soft nihilism” toward the trends toward a fully digital currency and what that means for the (western) world moving forward. Although, according to him, it affects all of us - whether occidental or oriental.

> Land was very left-accelerationist in his early days, and *Fanged Noumena* reflects those views. The right-wing fascist shit seems to have come in more recent years. Legend has it that he lost his mind a bit due to methamphetamine psychosis or something like that, but I don’t know how true that is.

> Land appears problematic in a way analogous to Nietszche; the social context of who frames/promotes the work is more important to many than the content, especially for readers invested in a political struggle. Decoupling beliefs and examining each independently is philosophical work, not political work. Politickers are incentivized to build consensus and establish a normative dichotomy where each individual is labeled ally or foe, while philosophers are free to relinquish this social pressure.

> Land's work is popular among some right reactionaries, notably Mencius Moldbug/Curtis Yarvin; for many, this guilt-by-association is enough to discredit him. I don't know to what extent Land is in present popular disgrace, but his older work may be considered on its own terms.

Rather than the concern being who promotes whom, it's instead the concern that his bigotry might have left a deep mark on his philosophical work, thus making it difficult to disentangle the good parts from the bad. The appropriate analogue here would be Heidegger and I think Liam Bright has two interesting [blog](https://sootyempiric.blogspot.com/2016/10/metalogic-against-heideggarian-naziism.html?m=1)
