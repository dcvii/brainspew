The consideration consists of about $1.75 billion in cash and about $275 million of equity consideration issued to GenNx360 Capital Partners, with registration rights, subject to a customary lock-up period.

The agreement also includes up to $125 million in additional contingent earnout consideration based on Precision’s performance.

Precision Aviation provides aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul services, as well as distribution, and supply chain solutions for commercial, business and general aviation, rotorcraft and defense end markets. The company is headquartered in Atlanta and operates 29 locations.

The combined company is expected to operate 60 locations worldwide. It will be on track to exceed 20% consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margin over the next few years, VSE said.

The acquisition is also expected to boost revenue, and would represent an estimated 50% increase in full year 2025 revenue on a pro forma basis, the company said.
