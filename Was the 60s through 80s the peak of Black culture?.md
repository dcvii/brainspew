[Was the 60s through 80s the peak of Black culture?](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-60s-through-80s-the-peak-of-Black-culture)

The difficulty here is that there are various aspects of African American culture that cannot all go under the heading of ‘Black culture’.

For example, it took me just a minute to discover that the Miles Davis album Kind of Blue was recorded in 1959. African Americans weren’t calling themselves ‘black’ until the mid 60s. So technically you could use the 60s-80s as specifically and aesthetically ‘black’ decades. But think about it another way.

Split music into genres. Spirituals. Blues. Jazz. R&B. Soul. Gospel. Hiphop. You could call all of that ‘black’ but the term would be anachronistic. You almost can’t say ‘Spirituals’ without the connotation of Negro Spiritual, which is certainly different than Gospel.

That says nothing about literature, poetry, dance, fashion, liturgy, cuisine, painting, photography, murals, comedy, vaudeville…

So if you are speaking about all African Americans over several hundred years of American history, I would only say that in pop culture, the 60s 70s and 80s were outstanding, but not for literature or jazz or a host of other types of cultural production. Specifically as Black as distinguished from Negro, then those arts influenced by Black Nationalism, Black Consciousness and Black Arts movements

were predominant from the mid 60s through the mid to late 70s. Thats when you would consider artists like

- The Last Poets
- Gwendolyn Brooks
- Ismael Reed
- Amiri Baraka

Yes then technically you could speak about Black culture during that period.
