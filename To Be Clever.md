It's lonely and alienating.

It's like knowing the words to songs that people hum and wondering why they don't sing. It's like knowing the punchlines to all the jokes that people tell and laughing just to be polite. It's like being curious about the answers to questions that most people don't care about and realizing those answers could solve other people's problems but they don't want to listen to you anyway. It makes you look flippant or even random because you see implications that others don't see, so you answer quickly without fully explaining everything.

It tempts you to evil.

It makes you want to take advantage. It gives you an excuse for everything faster. It makes you arrogant because you start to believe that you are not only smarter but better. It makes you truly appreciate evil genius, because you see more genius than evil. It makes you see the weaknesses and inconsistencies in popular heroes and it makes you want to undermine them. It allows you to play devil's advocate and disillusion people who haven't figured things out yet.

It's frustrating.

It makes you overthink everything instead of closing your eyes and making a choice. It allows you to see all sides of an argument, all ways of dealing with people, all sorts of food. It makes it that much harder to make what ought to be simple choices. It makes it difficult to accept that you make dumb mistakes just like everybody else. It makes it hard to complain when you actually have it pretty good, but you complain anyway and people think you're a jerk.

It's humbling.

It makes you realize how much thought goes into a lot of things that most people take for granted. It makes you worry and concern about all the ways you discover that things can go wrong. It makes you extraordinarily grateful that things *don't* go wrong. It makes you want to stop interacting at a shallow level and try to do something really important. And if you decide to do that, it makes you very thankful for the ordinary folks who support you when you do.

Other than that, it's great and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Just thought you should know the downside.
