1. **Do something new; don’t run with the pack.** I am not such a fast runner. If I am one of _N_ people all working on the same problem, there is very little chance I will win. If I can think of a new problem in a new area, that will give me a chance.
    
2. **Surround yourself with the smartest people you can find.** When you see such a person, do all you can to get them on board. That extends your reach, and terrific people are usually fun to work with.
    
3. **Be guided by beauty.** This is obviously true in doing mathematics or writing poetry, but it is also true in fashioning an organization that is running extremely well and accomplishing its mission with excellence.
    
4. **Don’t give up easily.** Some things take much longer than one initially expects. If the goal is worth achieving, just stick with it.
    
5. **Hope for good luck!**
