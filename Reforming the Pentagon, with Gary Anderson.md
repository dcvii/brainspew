### opportunity need ideas

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424)

With each new administration, there is opportunity for change and reform. In the new Trump Administration, reform isn’t seen as a secondary effect of a leadership change but as a requirement.

What reform options should the new Pentagon leadership explore under the Trump Administration?

Joining us to discuss this and related topics is Gary Anderson, Colonel, USMC (Ret.).

A starting point for our conversation will be his recent article in *The American Spectator*, [Real Military Reform Begins:](https://spectator.org/real-military-reform-begins/) *[Will Pete Hegseth be able to reverse our military’s decline](https://spectator.org/real-military-reform-begins/).*

Gary retired as the chief of staff of the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab. He served as a special adviser to the deputy secretary of defense. He is an adjunct professor at George Washington University.
