My experience with Russians in the software business is that they have demonstrated four kinds of virtues that work well for programming.

#1. Fatalism: Russians can live with stories with sad or tragic endings. They don't necessarily expect a light at the end of the tunnel. This rids them from wishful thinking. They don't complain because somebody else isn't doing their part. So that forces them to do every part and they don't depend on collaboration. Americans expect champagne sprays on the podium and thanking all the little people who helped. The Russian wants to thank no one but himself.

#2. Thrift: Russians can do with less. The sharpest Russian programmer I knew kept telling me how amazed he was that American programmers wasted so much memory. He was used to making all of his mallocs work, and when they didn't he built his own garbage collection. If he didn't need memory, he didn't ask for memory, and he never asked for more memory just in case. When you get a Maths degree on the equivalent of $400 a month living with your wife and baby, you tend not to waste.

#3. Stealth: Russians don't draw attention to themselves. They don't expect the public to love them for their accomplishments. So they will work closely with people they trust, and not at all with others they don't know.

#4. Romance: After all that, Russians treasure beauty and elegance. They will sweat the details. Everything, no matter how small, can be a work of art. They seek a perfection in their work and it is the perfection of that work that is gratifying. A Russian sees his code as poetry.

Google translate says that proper translation is “curiosity”, which is not quite right. The russian equivalent of curiosity is “любопытство”. Just like curiosity, “любопытство” can have negative connotation. “… (more) [Carlito Carlos](https://www.quora.com/profile/Carlito-Carlos-2) · [5y](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-Russian-hackers-are-the-best-hackers-in-the-world-If-so-how-come/answer/Michael-David-Cobb-Bowen?comment_id=98687773&comment_type=2)

Любознательность translates as inquisitiveness in english. It literally describes the quality of wanting to discover as much as you can about things.

If they don’t reveal themselves how come everyone knows about them? “THE BEST” in this particular field, especially if you’re boasting “STEALTH” are those who get away with it. If I was a Russian hacker trying to sell malware, I would make it look like I’m British or Indian.

It is done by passionate Russophobs that are so blinded by their hatred of Russians that don’t understand that they are actually building the brand “Russian hacker” very much like a brand: “smart, rich Jew” was build by N… (more) Elliot Alderson I highly doubt that the Nazi propagandists got those two right.

that kinda makes sense, because, if somebody is a good hacker, he most certainly wouldn’t reveal himself, and there’s no way of knowing who that guy was
