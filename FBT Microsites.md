FBT Voices Microsites Press Release.pdf

File

Take this document and generate a brief set of questions as if you were a person who decided to have such a microsite built for you

As someone considering a microsite built for me through the FBT Voices Microsites platform, here are a few questions I would ask based on the provided document:
1. Content Inclusion: What types of my work can be included in the microsite’s database? For example, can it handle my books, articles, podcasts, and private or paywalled content, and are there any limitations?
2. Customization: How much control do I have over the design and presentation of my microsite, such as the layout, branding, or specific features highlighted?
3. AI Summaries: How does the AI (CiteMap) ensure accurate and fair representation of my ideas in the generated summaries, Q&A insights, and related content suggestions?
4. Update Process: How frequently is the content on my microsite updated, and do I need to manually provide new material or is it automatically sourced?
5. Citation and Fair Use: How does the platform handle copyright and fair use for my work, especially for protected or academic content, to ensure compliance?
6. Audience Access: Who can access my microsite, and are there options to restrict or customize access for specific audiences, like scholars or subscribers?
7. Analytics and Engagement: Will I receive data on how users interact with my microsite, such as page views, popular content, or search queries?
8. Cost and Maintenance: What are the costs associated with building and maintaining my microsite, and are there ongoing fees for hosting or updates? (I understand I may need to check [https://x.ai/grok](https://x.ai/grok) for some details.)
9. Expansion Plans: How will my microsite integrate with the broader FBT Voices directory, and what’s the timeline for adding new features or authors?
10. Technical Support: What kind of technical support is provided by Thinkdeeply or By The Way Labs if issues arise with the microsite’s functionality?

These questions aim to clarify the process, capabilities, and benefits of having a personalized microsite while ensuring my work is accurately represented and accessible.
