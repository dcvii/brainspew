You’ve asked two questions—let’s tackle them one by one:

  

⸻

  

**1. How many high‑level leaders have been purged under Xi in the CCP?**

• **Anti-corruption campaign scope:** Since Xi Jinping initiated the anti-corruption campaign (post‑18th Party Congress in 2012), it has targeted “tigers and flies”—i.e., both high-level and rank-and-file officials. Estimates suggest the campaign has **“netted” over 120 high-ranking officials**, including military officers, state-owned enterprise executives, and even some national leaders  .

• **Recent figures (2024 alone):** In the first three quarters of 2024, **at least 58 high-ranking cadres** across Party and state bodies were removed, with a staggering **642,000 lower-level cadres disciplined** in that span  .

• **Focus on the military:** The People’s Liberation Army has been a particular focus lately. A U.S. Department of Defense report notes **at least 15 senior military officers and defense‑industry executives** purged  . Other sources report that Xi has purged **over 20 senior PLA commanders**, including members of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC)  .

• **CMC-specific purges:** By mid‑2025, the purge had reached the CMC itself: **eight members have been ousted** since Xi came to power, including Admiral Miao Hua—marked as one of the highest-level CMC purges since the 1960s  .

  

**Summary:**

• Total high-ranking purged since 2012: **Over 120 individuals**.

• In 2024 alone: **At least 58 senior cadres** removed.

• Military/PLA-specific: **15+ senior officers**, including **20+ PLA commanders**, and **8 CMC members** purged to date.

  

⸻

  

**2. Which Congress is it now?**

  

The current party body is based on the **20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party**, held **October 16–22, 2022**. That Congress elected the new Central Committee, Politburo, Standing Committee, and confirmed Xi’s unprecedented third term as General Secretary     .

• These Congresses occur every five years, so the **20th** is the latest. The next one will likely be in **2027**  .

**At a glance**

  

**Question** **Answer**

**High‑level purges under Xi** Over 120 high-ranking officials since 2012; 58+ removed in 2024; 15+ senior military figures; 8 CMC members purged

**Which Congress is it now?** The **20th National Congress**, held in October 2022—next expected in 2027

  

Let me know if you’d like to dig deeper into specific cases or how these purges have affected CCP structure and governance.

  

  

In China’s Communist Party and government system, **cadres** are categorized in a rigid bureaucratic hierarchy with distinct ranks, each tied to corresponding privileges, responsibilities, and compensation. The system is often referred to as the **“Cadre Rank System” (干部级别体制)** and aligns both Party and state functions into roughly **15 levels**, though informal perks increase dramatically at the top.

  

⸻

  

🔺 **Cadre Rank Structure (Simplified Overview)**

  

**Rank Level** **Administrative Rank** **Common Positions** **Approx. Monthly Base Pay (¥ RMB)** **Notes**

**Level 1** State-level President, Premier, Standing Committee (7 people) ¥20,000–25,000 Highest level; heavy informal perks

**Level 2** Deputy State Vice Premiers, Politburo ¥18,000–22,000 Minister-level clout

**Level 3** Ministerial (正部级) Ministers, Provincial Party Secretaries, Governors of major provinces ¥15,000–20,000 Often Party Central Committee members

**Level 4** Deputy Ministerial (副部级) Vice Ministers, Vice Governors ¥13,000–17,000 Includes mayors of large cities (e.g., Beijing)

**Level 5** Bureau-level (正厅级) Department heads in ministries, major city mayors ¥10,000–15,000 Common target of anti-corruption probes

**Level 6** Deputy Bureau (副厅级) Deputy department heads ¥8,000–12,000 Rising mid-level cadres

**Level 7–8** County-level (正处/副处级) County heads, office directors ¥6,000–9,000 Starting senior management

**Level 9–10** Township-level (科级) Township chiefs, clerks ¥4,000–7,000 Entry-level leadership

**Below** Section-level and Civilian Local staff, Party secretaries at village level ¥2,000–4,000 Huge variance depending on region

  

🔸 _Note:_ Salaries vary by location and seniority. Coastal cadres often receive more than inland peers. Numbers above are base salaries—many benefits are **off-book or in-kind**.

  

⸻

  

🧾 **Sources of Compensation Beyond Base Salary**

  

High-ranking cadres typically receive:

• **Free or subsidized housing** in elite compounds (e.g., Zhongnanhai, provincial villas)

• **Official cars + drivers**, even for bureau-level

• **Healthcare at elite clinics**, e.g., 301 Hospital in Beijing

• **Bonuses** linked to performance metrics (economic growth, “stability”)

• **Travel stipends**, often with diplomatic or “inspection” privileges

• **Gifts, red envelopes**, or informal income—often the basis of corruption charges

  

⸻

  

🧱 **Political vs. Administrative Hierarchy**

  

There is a dual hierarchy:

• **Party Rank** determines real power (e.g., Party Secretary > Mayor)

• **State Administrative Rank** determines formal title and civil service pay

  

For example:

• A **provincial Party secretary** outranks the **governor**, even if both are ministerial rank.

• In the military, a **general** may hold a “deputy state” rank if they are on the Central Military Commission.

🧮 **Example: A Level 3 Provincial Governor**

  

**Item** **Approximate Value (¥/month)**

Base salary ¥16,000

Housing (non-cash value) ¥20,000+

Car/driver/stipends ¥10,000–15,000

Healthcare & perks Varies

**Total benefit package (conservative)** ¥45,000–¥60,000/month (~$6,200–$8,300 USD)

  

  

⸻

  

💡 **Fun Fact: Discreet Wealth**

  

Despite modest official salaries, many top officials:

• Amass hidden wealth via **family connections**, **state-owned enterprises**, or **real estate**

• Keep wealth in the names of children or in offshore accounts (e.g., Panama Papers)

• Are rarely seen in luxury attire or cars—outward modesty is enforced

  

⸻

  

Would you like to see a breakdown for military ranks or SOE (state-owned enterprise) executives next? Or I can explain how “Red Aristocracy” families fit into this structure.

  

  

State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) executives in China often hold **bureaucratic rank equivalents** within the Party-state system and are among the most well-compensated individuals in China’s public sector—**both formally and informally**. Their power stems not only from their official roles but also from control over vast resources, industrial assets, and procurement pipelines.

  

⸻

  

🏢 **SOE Executive Ranks and Party Status**

  

Many SOE leaders are also **Party cadres**, with **ranks tied to CCP hierarchy**:

  

**SOE Role** **Typical Administrative Rank** **CCP Rank Equivalent** **Notes**

Chairman / Party Secretary (央企) Ministerial (正部级) Full Central Committee member Equivalent to a Minister

General Manager Deputy Ministerial (副部级) Alternate Central Committee member Often former technocrats

Deputy General Manager Bureau-level (厅局级) Often senior Party members Climb into politics from here

Department Head Deputy Bureau (副厅级) Party membership common Technical specialists

  

Central SOEs (央企) report directly to **SASAC** – the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission under the State Council.

  

⸻

  

💵 **Compensation Overview: Formal + Informal**

  

**Formal Compensation (Post-Reform)**

  

After anti-corruption tightening (post-2014), executive compensation was **capped** and publicized:

  

**Role** **Formal Annual Salary Cap (post-2015)** **Notes**

Central SOE Chairman ¥600,000–¥900,000 (~$85k–$130k) Many caps set by SASAC

General Manager ¥500,000–¥700,000 Capped by administrative grade

Department Head ¥250,000–¥400,000 Includes bonus

  

These caps apply **only to central SOEs** (央企) like PetroChina, Sinopec, State Grid, China Mobile, etc. Local SOEs often vary and may not fully follow cap regulations.

  

⸻

  

**Informal or Disguised Compensation**

  

Despite official caps, executives may enjoy:

• **“Consulting fees” or stock options** from subsidiaries and listed arms

• **Housing subsidies or ownership** of apartments at below-market cost

• **Expense accounts, cars, elite schools** for children

• **Board memberships in offshore JVs or suppliers**

• **State-funded travel, club memberships, luxury perks**

  

⸻

  

🧾 **Case Study: Sinopec Chairman**

  

**Category** **Estimated Value (Annual)**

Official Salary ~¥800,000

Housing + Car + Perks ~¥600,000–¥1M

External consulting or side income (undisclosed) Often exceeds ¥2–3M

**Total value (conservative)** ¥3M–¥5M (~$400k–$700k)

  

Some senior executives have been found with hidden personal wealth **in the tens or hundreds of millions USD**, as seen in corruption probes.

  

⸻

  

💣 **SOE Executives as Targets**

  

SOEs are major targets of Xi Jinping’s **anti-corruption campaign**:

• Industries like **energy, telecom, aviation, and defense** have seen many top executives purged.

• Reasons include **bribery**, **embezzlement**, **abuse of procurement**, and **“collusion with foreign entities.”**

  

Notable cases:

• **Lai Xiaomin**, ex-chairman of Huarong, was executed in 2021 after being found with **600+ apartments and 270M yuan in cash**.

• **Zhang Huimin**, Party Secretary of China Power Investment Corp., was removed for discipline violations.

📊 **Summary Table**

  

**Level** **Position** **Official Pay** **Estimated Total Comp** **Party Rank**

Top Chairman, Party Sec. ¥600k–¥900k ¥3M–¥6M (with perks) Ministerial

Mid GM, Deputy GM ¥400k–¥700k ¥1.5M–¥3M Deputy Min / Bureau

Dept Head Functional Leader ¥250k–¥400k ¥800k–¥1.2M Bureau

Here’s a clearer comparison between what an average professional in a Chinese provincial capital might pay for rent and earn—and how that contrasts with a Level‑3 cadre (e.g., a provincial governor).

  

⸻

  

**1. Rent in Provincial Capitals**

• **One-bedroom apartments outside the city center** typically range from **¥1,500 to ¥4,500 per month** ($210–$625) in many cities. In second-tier cities, rents can be even lower—around **¥1,000 to ¥3,000 per month** ($140–$420). 

• **In first-tier cities** (Beijing, Shanghai), central rents are higher—approximately **¥6,500 to ¥7,000 per month**, while still closer-in averages in **¥3,000 to ¥8,000/month**.  

  

Most provincial capitals fall into the second-tier bracket, so **¥1,500–¥3,000/month** is a reasonable assumption for average rent.

  

⸻

  

**2. Typical Income of Professionals**

• **Urban average salary** varies regionally, but coastal and developed provinces report higher figures. For example, top provinces and municipalities (like Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu) have **non-private sector average annual salaries exceeding ¥190,000**, equivalent to **¥15,800/month or more**.  

  

A typical mid-level professional living in these cities might earn around **¥12,000–¥16,000 per month**, depending on industry and location.

  

⸻

  

**Versus Level‑3 Cadre (Provincial Governor)**

• Provincial governors and Party secretaries, who are **Level‑3 (ministerial rank)**, have a **base salary of less than ¥9,000 per month**. 

• But this base pay excludes substantial **non-salary benefits**: government housing, cars with drivers, healthcare, stipends, and in-kind perks—often greatly raising their effective compensation.

  

**Comparison Summary**

  

**Role / Group** **Monthly Base Salary** **Typical Rent (Provincial Capital)** **Notes**

**Avg. Professional** ¥12,000–¥16,000 (est.) ¥1,500–¥3,000 Significant portion of salary may go to housing

**Level‑3 Governor (base pay)** < ¥9,000 Likely subsidized or free Perks far exceed base pay

  

  

⸻

  

**Key Insights**

• Most professionals spend about **10–25% of their gross income on rent**.

• Level‑3 cadres have **lower base salaries** but enjoy **much richer in-kind benefits** that vastly improve their living standards.

• These disparities highlight how **official perks and informal benefits** change the lived reality of rankings more than base compensation alone.
