I closely followed the inquisition of Jordan Peterson by the College of Psychologists of Ontario (CPO). It unfolded like a Kafka-meets-Stephen King novel. As a physician, this case and its precedents have direct implications for my profession’s ability to care for patients. Healthcare professionals are increasingly compelled to self-censor or parrot only what their regulatory body deems acceptable on politicized topics. In this context, the CPO was abjectly failing its legal mandate to uphold the public interest. Peterson’s case – and the growing number that seem politically motivated – serve as another curtain call for Canadian liberty. Remind me again of how absolute power corrupts?

In 2022, Peterson’s [college received roughly 15 complaints](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/read-jordan-petersons-tweets-that-prompted-complaints-to-psychologists-college) about comments he made online from people around the world, including criticism of Justin Trudeau. The kicker was that not only were none of the complainants his patients, some falsely claimed to be. Surely, these would be dismissed as vexatious. Instead, the CPO ordered Peterson to undergo social media re-training at his own expense for an indeterminate amount of time, on pain of license forfeiture.

They must have known he was voicing what many were thinking. How about after the [public protest](https://tnc.news/2023/01/12/toronto-peterson-rally/) outside their ivory tower? Or when they received about [25 000 complaints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejvH4GBXmfA) about how they were treating him? Amazingly, the psychology Politburo failed to recognize their own diagnosis of institutional narcissistic personality disorder.

My own regulator, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO), reprimanded Drs. [Irene Polidoulis and Kulvinder Gill](https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/the-new-censorship-regulatory-creep-professional-regulators-and-growing-limits-on-freedom-of-expression/) for not sticking to the ideological script during the pandemic. Free speech champion Elon Musk has supported Dr. Gill’s appeal to the Supreme Court. In contrast, the CPSO received nearly 70 complaints about a [physician calling for gun bans](https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/the-new-censorship-regulatory-creep-professional-regulators-and-growing-limits-on-freedom-of-expression/) on social media and correctly dismissed them as frivolous. The double standard was unmistakable: only progressive viewpoints are permitted. As Orwell warned in *1984*, authoritarian bodies aim to narrow the range of thought.

I was relieved when Dr. Peterson chose to fight this in court. But this witch hunt morphed into a dystopian nightmare when the court ruled against him and, subsequently, the Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal, closing all legal avenues within Canada.Whether or not you agree with Peterson is beside the point. The CPO’s victory, by extension, granted Big Brother-like powers over the one in five Canadians who are regulated professionals.

What were all these ideologically captured institutions thinking? Recent inquiries into COVID-era regulation – including [Alberta’s task force](https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/88bbf80e-f8c8-4355-b751-c2086e204b34/resource/73efb35c-41d9-4264-881d-15a1f76861d3/download/hlth-albertas-covid-19-pandemic-response-2025-01-revised-biographies.pdfhttps:/open.alberta.ca/dataset/88bbf80e-f8c8-4355-b751-c2086e204b34/resource/73efb35c-41d9-4264-881d-15a1f76861d3/download/hlth-albertas-covid-19-pandemic-response-2025-01-revised-biographies.pdf) – have reinforced what many professionals experienced firsthand: colleges increasingly acted as “arbiters of truth” rather than guardians of evidence-based practice, with just 2% of their communications citing studies. “Regulators actively sought to intimidate, threaten, and discipline medical professionals.” And doing their best Stasi impression, they even directed members to report colleagues – despite the fact that most actions later deemed punishable were ultimately defensible. With public trust in healthcare authorities fractured since COVID, and as more medical topics become politicized, patients are already routing around the system – often toward AI – because they no longer trust doctors to speak freely.

Pioneering Surgeon Joseph Lister faced ridicule in the 1800s for advocating sterile wounds and instruments. Hindsight being 2020, there are many pandemic policies public health officials would now rethink, such as [prolonged school closures](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/wages-and-gdp-lost-due-to-covid-19-school-closures/). What medical topics will be off-limits tomorrow? As technologies and pharmaceuticals continue to evolve, instead of regulatory apparatchiks making declarations of misinformation, the autocorrective process of free speech is best poised to safeguard patient care. As both a physician and Canadian citizen, I would rather have questions I can’t answer than answers I can’t question.

Peterson suggested [limiting complaints to Canadian patients and their families](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jordan-peterson-i-am-ready-for-my-re-education-who-will-be-my-tutor), and restricting them to the professional’s field of practice. Regulators should, at minimum, commit to not policing political speech. I would go further. Professionals, especially physicians, must be able to defend themselves just the same as common criminals. Maoist struggle sessions, where guilt is presumed and leniency follows immediate confession, should be forbidden. When there’s no mutual admission of fault, go quickly to an independent arbitrator agreed upon by both parties.

There must also be skin in the game for the complainant. It should not be possible to trigger a life-altering ordeal for a professional upon whom patients depend with a few mouse clicks. Reasonable procedural safeguards could help discourage frivolous complaints while preserving access for legitimate ones – for example, a modest filing fee refundable if a complaint is deemed non-vexatious, or a more structured complaint requirement that demands a modicum of specificity and evidence at the outset. No system will be perfect – only tradeoffs – but every functioning system requires checks and balances.

There is, however, a glimmer of hope. In Alberta, Bill 13 – the [Regulated Professions Neutrality Act](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/amy-hamm-albertas-jordan-peterson-law-is-sorely-needed-across-canada), informally dubbed “Peterson’s Law” – has passed first reading, signaling a serious attempt to rein in regulatory overreach by restoring viewpoint neutrality as a guardrail within professional colleges. If carried forward, it would represent a rare recognition that regulators exist to protect the public, not to enforce ideological conformity.

Even if such reforms ultimately stop at the provincial border, the rest of Canada’s professional colleges would benefit from embracing epistemic humility. They could shrug off the burden of having all the answers – a weight as unbearable as Atlas’ celestial load – and concede that they have struggled to adapt their self-regulatory role to a rapidly evolving technological, informational, and political landscape. By returning to evidence, due process, and genuine neutrality, colleges will win by restoring confidence in their institutions and rebuilding public trust in the professionals they govern.

In the end, Peterson agreed to attend social media re-training on the condition that it be made public. Yet in a twist that turned the saga into black comedy, the College was unable to identify any suitable [“social media experts”](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/blog/jordan-peterson-at-long-last-my-re-education-coach-has-been-chosen/) for months. When a facilitator was [eventually unearthed](https://www.harrycayton.net/), the CPO insisted the proceeding remain confidential – very much in the spirit of a totalitarian dustup. Peterson declined on principle. By that point, Canada had already lost one of its most prominent public intellectuals, who had relocated to the U.S. in part due to this ordeal.

This episode is nested within the broader culture war, specifically the battle for free speech. As the calendar turns to 2026, liberty-authority has become a far more relevant lens for understanding political allegiances than right-left, and many Canadians yearn to shift back to liberty. Regardless, the eternal truth remains: absolute power corrupts absolutely. It’s time to rein in the colleges, reverse their Ministry of Truth tendencies, and return them from professional strangulation to regulation.
