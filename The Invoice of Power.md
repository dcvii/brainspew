The Invoice of Power

For all the crying haters of U.S. power projection. You mistake American peace for a donation.

Peace is not mailed out like aid packages. It’s underwritten. By carriers you don’t build, by logistics you don’t maintain, by men and women you didn’t raise, and by a debt of blood you never agreed to pay.

You mortgaged your future and outsourced your security. Now you project morality instead of power and call it “sovereignty.”

You cry foul when America decides the bill is due. When we choose to remove a parasite like Nicolás Maduro from the bloodstream of a hemisphere we’ve kept stable for generations. You say it’s illegitimate, unfair, and that it violates norms.

Norms are written by those who can enforce them.

You ask if we think peace is benevolent. No. Peace is transactional. The price is alignment, stability, and order. If you don’t pay it, someone else will, eventually with interest.

This is the sickness of the postwar world: a civilization feminized by safety it did not earn, mistaking feelings for force and outrage for deterrence. You boo and hiss about sovereignty while cheering mass migration, institutional decay, and the slow motion rape of the West. Your moral vocabulary is loud; your martial vocabulary is empty.

So understand this clearly: If you disagree, do something about it. Because your boos mean nothing to a nation that has seen what you applaud.

This is a mask off moment. You don’t have to respect America. Fear will suffice.

We are not cruel, merely structural. Gravity does not apologize to the weak for pulling them down. Fire does not explain itself to straw.

America is strong. You are not. That’s not personal. That is simply the way of things.

Power is the rent you pay to exist unmolested in a violent world. If you refuse to pay it, don’t be shocked when the landlord shows up.

I sometimes blackpill too hard. But lately, I’m starting to see America might not be in total decline, just hitting puberty. So yea, it’s about to get weird. But we aren’t going anywhere.

For the soft among you out there, I guess you’re just gonna have to deal.

no one incapable of great violence can truly be called peaceful.

they are merely harmless and that is not the same thing at all.

some antiquated doofus from a past age jumping up and down in funny pantaloons and waving a halberd at the monroe doctrine from the other side of an ocean across which they cannot and dare not project power amounts to neither politics nor morality.

it's a monty python skit.

Yes yes. We fully understand all that.

But for what purpose?

When you say Peace, and I see the weapons I paid for raining down on innocent children, I question your definition.

If we are to be powerful, let us be Wise and Just.

Without our Values we are nothing.

Made me think of the Col. Jessup soliloquy "I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it!"
