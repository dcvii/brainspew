![🇺🇸](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tf2/2/16/1f1fa_1f1f8.png) FACT CHECK: What Really Happened in the ICE Incident in Minneapolis…  
  
There’s a lot of misleading information out there.  
  
Some headlines paint this as “ICE shot an innocent woman driving away,” but the actual details reported by credible outlets tell a different story…  
  
Let’s break it down ..claim by claim ..with sources.  
  
![🧾](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6f/2/16/1f9fe.png) ![1️⃣](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t59/2/16/31_20e3.png) A woman was blocking law enforcement vehicles..  
  
Videos and police accounts show a woman’s SUV was stopped sideways in the street, intentionally blocking ICE vehicles during a federal enforcement operation.  
  
Federal officials reported that the vehicle was impeding officers’ movement before any shots were fired..

According to video reviewed on the scene and reported by local news, agents “repeatedly yelled for the driver to stop and exit the vehicle” and several agents attempted to engage her before force was used…  
  
One agent was behind the vehicle, one attempted to open the driver door, another was standing in front of the woman’s SUV where the woman had a clear view of the officer..

This is important …the narrative of “she was just driving away” is not supported by multiple cameras showing attempts to stop the vehicle…

Officials, including Minnesota public safety representatives, described the woman’s movements as refusing to comply and then aggressively moving the vehicle toward agents..

That language “weaponize her vehicle” is why the federal self-defense justification was cited…

Some headlines emphasized “ICE shot an innocent driver”  
  
But others are arguing that the woman deliberately try to run over the ICE agents with her car..  
  
Even local leaders who criticized the shooting acknowledged conflicting evidence about how the situation unfolded, not that she was simply leaving..

Multiple angles show at least two agents approaching the vehicle with different commands …one telling her to drive away, another telling her to get out…  
  
This is precisely the kind of detail law enforcement investigators will analyze, and is part of why independent review is ongoing..

At the time of reporting, no final official conclusion had been publicly released about whether the use of deadly force was justified legally …that determination typically comes after:  
  
• full review of all video angles  
• witness statements  
• ballistics / forensics  
• expert use-of-force analysis

My Take:  
  
If we’re going to be honest, we have to slow the video down and look at what actually happened not what people want it to show…  
  
When the vehicle begins to move, it does not immediately turn away from the officer… like you typically would see if you wanted to avoid hitting something..  
  
Frame by frame, you can see:  
• The officer is positioned directly in front of the vehicle in an attempt to stop her..  
• The driver presses the gas while the officer is still in that path..  
• The turn to the right occurs after the officer draws his weapon..  
  
If the intent had been simply to flee without endangering anyone, the vehicle would have immediately turned away from the officer…  
  
It did not.  
  
That distinction matters.  
  
This was not a random shooting of a person “walking up” or “doing nothing.” This was a violent encounter involving a vehicle, which under U.S. law is considered a potentially deadly weapon…  
  
UPDATE: Additional Video Angle Clarifies the Sequence..  
  
Another video angle circulating shows the incident from the front of the vehicle, and it provides important context…  
  
From this angle, you can see that:  
• An ICE agent originally approached from behind the vehicle  
• He then moved along the right side of the car  
• The agent walked directly across the front of the vehicle to reposition himself in front of the vehicle..  
  
At the moment the agent crossed in front of the car, the vehicle lunged forward, making contact with and forcing the agent to immediately pull to his right to avoid being struck down or knocked down by the vehicle…  
  
It was after that forward movement…when the agent perceived an immediate threat…that he drew his weapon.  
  
Only then does the vehicle turn to the right, consistent with an attempt to flee after the use-of-force decision had already been triggered…  
  
This matters, because it directly contradicts the claim that the driver simply “tried to drive away” without endangering officers…  
  
A vehicle that accelerates while an officer is positioned in front of it is legally considered a potential deadly threat, regardless of intent…  
  
That sequence …movement toward the officer first, evasive turn second …is visible when the video is slowed down frame by frame…  
  
This is why the incident is being evaluated as a use-of-force encounter involving a vehicle, not a random or unprovoked shooting.  
  
![⚖️](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t8b/2/16/2696.png) WHAT THE LAW ACTUALLY SAYS  
  
Under long-standing federal and state use-of-force standards:  
• A vehicle can constitute deadly force  
• Officers may use lethal force if they reasonably believe they face an imminent threat of serious bodily harm or death  
• Failure to obey lawful commands while advancing a vehicle toward an officer can meet that threshold  
  
This standard comes from:  
• Graham v. Connor (U.S. Supreme Court)  
• DOJ Use-of-Force Policy  
• Minnesota Peace Officer Standards & Training (POST) guidelines  
  
The question investigators examine is not intent after the fact…it’s whether a reasonable officer, in that moment, perceived an imminent threat…  
  
And that evaluation includes:  
• Positioning  
• Movement of the vehicle  
• Failure to comply with commands  
• Timing …measured in fractions of a second, not hindsight minutes  
  
That’s why slowing the footage down matters.  
  
This incident is being reviewed under established legal standards ..not internet narratives..  
  
But based on the visible sequence alone, the claim that she was “just trying to drive away” does not align with the video evidence…  
  
Facts matter.  
Context matters.  
And vehicles used this way are not benign.
