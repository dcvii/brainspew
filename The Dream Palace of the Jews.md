On Oct. 6, 2023, Israeli society, fragmented and torn when it comes to just about any subject imaginable, was in full agreement on one thing: The best way to handle the threat posed by Hamas in Gaza was by pursuing a cautious policy that focused on economic incentives, involved international stakeholders, and revolved around the logic that the more prosperous Gaza grows, the harder it would be for Hamas to hold on to power.

The Israeli left, or whatever remained of it, celebrated this strategy as the embodiment of intelligent, progressive policymaking, the sort of stuff cheered on in Davos by the globalist smart set. The Israeli right, too, went along for the ride: Whatever his actions might’ve been after Oct. 7, before the massacre, there was no mistaking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s dedication to the belief that Hamas could be contained by throwing a few more millions of dollars and a few more work permits into the pot.

Why would Netanyahu, who has since shown commendable resolve when it comes to forcefully addressing Israel’s key existential threats—Iran first and foremost—pursue such a policy? The answer is simple: because the entirety of Israel’s security forces told him to. In September of 2023, for example, according to reports in the Israeli press, a Mossad delegation left for Qatar and encouraged the government in Doha to continue and funnel funds to Gaza, despite acknowledging that some of the money may go to financing Hamas’ military efforts.

Even more alarming—and in direct contradiction to his statements after being asked to step aside in the aftermath of the massacre—Ronen Bar, director of the Shin Bet, argued fiercely in favor of continuing to pour cash and aid into Gaza. Each year, the head of Israel’s esteemed security service issues a document known as the “Directive,” understood to reflect the organization’s insights into Israel’s national priorities and threats. The 2023 “Directive,” released several months prior to the attack, found Bar waxing philosophical and asking a host of conceptual questions to showcase his worldview. Two in particular stood out: Does economic investment lead to stabilizing the region? And does economic stability undermine Hamas’ abilities in the long run?

Bar answered both questions in the affirmative. Hamas, he argued in the report, wasn’t anything like a formidable foe, which is why military strikes, including targeted assassinations of Hamas bigwigs, were largely ineffectual. The only path to pursue, Bar went on, was more aid to Gaza.

According to the Israeli newspaper *Yisrael Hayom*, which reviewed unpublished official Shin Bet documents, Bar repeated the same line on Oct. 5, 2023, when he chaired a discussion dedicated to Israel’s conduct vis-à-vis Hamas. The way forward, he argued, was “delivering substantial humanitarian aid to Gaza as an act of goodwill,” including awarding 1,500 additional Israeli work permits to Gazan laborers and increasing the amount of supplies and medicine Israel delivers to the Gaza Strip.

The position was so widely spread at the time that few bothered questioning it, which is why almost no one raised an eyebrow in the summer of 2023, when Israel and Egypt announced their decision to proceed with the Gaza Marine project, a small gas field about 22 miles from Gaza’s coast. The project was complicated—Hamas threatened to blow up the gas fields unless it received a cut of the deal—but, ultimately, most pundits promised, beneficial. Forcing Hamas to become a partner in a major regional development deal, Israeli security officials said at the time, was a solid long-term investment likely to lead to the group’s eventual decline. With Egypt as a partner, they continued, and with the strip growing more prosperous, Hamas will eventually disappear, either by evolving into a rational, responsible governing body or by ceding control to the Western-educated technocrats who knew all about complicated things like structuring multinational energy deals.

Meanwhile, a few miles to the south, in Gaza, Hamas had very different plans. We know all about them because of a considerable trove of documents and email exchanges captured by the IDF in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, such as the [document](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/top-secret-hamas-documents-show-terrorists-intentionally-targeted-elem-rcna120310) titled “Top Secret Maneuver” outlining the attack on Kibbutz Sa’ad and ordering “Combat Unit 1” to “contain the new Da’at school” while “Combat Unit 2” collects hostages and searches the Bnei Akiva youth center in order to murder and kidnap as many children and teenagers as possible. The attack, thankfully, was thwarted by the kibbutz’s volunteer security forces.

But you hardly needed access to Hamas’ clandestine files to understand what the organization had in mind. On Dec. 29, 2020, for example, the group’s leader, Ismail Haniyeh, publicly announced the launch of operation Strong Pillar, uniting Gaza’s terrorist factions in an effort to pursue their ultimate shared goal and destroy the Jewish State. Their first drill—shared publicly on the group’s social media channels—shows its commanders sitting in a bunker while their forces first launch a barrage of rockets and then raid mock Israeli army bases and civilian communities. The pictures bear an eerie resemblance to the ones Hamas broadcast to the world a few years later, this time killing and kidnapping real Israelis. This drill and others like it were reported in Israel in real time. They were promptly ignored.

Similarly underplayed was the so-called Salah al-Din Gate between Gaza and Egypt. Previously used to deliver humanitarian supplies to the strip, the crossing was reopened by Hamas in 2018. According to Al Jazeera, Hamas quickly drummed up brisk trade with Egypt to the tune of more than $45 million per month, of which the group kept about $12 million in taxes alone. The group, as *The New York Times* and others reported, had also siphoned off more than a billion dollars from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA.

Both revenue streams were peak opportunities to examine the Israeli axiom that with enough foreign money and influence floating around, Hamas would either moderate itself or be edged out. Instead, the group seized the cash, as well as supplies donated by the international community, to build hundreds of underground terror tunnels—spanning more than 450 miles, Israeli officials now believe—with each tunnel costing an estimated $3 million.

And the sturdier its infrastructure grew, the cockier the group got: In 2022, Hamas’ terrorists posted a video of a drill in which they stormed a mock Israeli military base. Their dummy IDF base was built just under two miles from the Erez crossing, and it had an elevated observation box, just like its real-life Israeli counterpart a short distance away. This ghoulish training facility was hardly hidden; you could spot it simply by looking at online mapping services of the area. And on Sept. 10, 2023, Hamas took to Telegram to share photos of uniformed terrorists surveying Israeli military facilities around the border and then—riding the same Toyota trucks used in the massacre itself—conducting a training exercise involving raiding civilian buildings and shooting dummy targets inside. Less than a month later, they repeated the same exercise, only this time the targets were real.

Following the attack, many Israelis demanded an accounting of who knew what and when, and who failed to act and why. The demand is understandable. It’s also profoundly idiotic, for three main reasons.

First, Israel’s failure wasn’t due to one person or group of people or even an entire organization failing to notice something that ought to have been obvious. It was about the entire society, more or less, collectively building itself a glittering dream palace and then retreating into it to cheerfully assure each other that the smart thing to do—the only thing to do, really—was to lavishly deliver more aid, money, and international involvement to Gaza until normalcy, prosperity, and peace triumphed, as they must, over benighted zealotry. That’s one major reason Israelis were so shocked when the ghouls cut the fence and engaged precisely in the sort of barbaric, medieval violence they’ve been openly advocating for and advertising for years: That Saturday morning, thousands of men, women, and children were slaughtered, but Israel’s entire way of thinking about and being in the world was butchered too. There’s no real point analyzing intelligence failures, say, or scouring the conduct of this or that high-ranking officer any more than there’s reason to ask which of the folks waiting in line in Jonestown for a sip of the Kool-Aid was more culpable of facilitating the community’s mass suicide. The entire society was all in on the delusion.

Which leads us to the second important and inconvenient insight to recall: Far from opposing this disastrous approach, Netanyahu was, if not exactly its author, then certainly its godfather, making it not only his default but a central pillar of his regional approach.

This would’ve been grim enough if it hadn’t been for insight number three: In the nearly two years that have passed since Oct. 7, Netanyahu hasn’t offered any real or clearly expressed alternative to this disastrous delusion. The prime minister—credit must be given—managed much of the war admirably, significantly undermining Hamas’ capabilities, all but destroying Hezbollah and, most commendable, acting decisively and courageously to curb Iran’s nuclear capacity. But neither he nor anyone else in power has offered any clear indication that they understand the need to radically rethink Israel’s approach in the region. Read between the lines, and all you’ll spot are remnants of the same old bad ideas: international aid, financial investments, economic incentives, aspirations of normalcy.

It may seem unkind, maybe even cruel, to chide Israelis, who are groaning under the burden of an ongoing war they’ve been fighting with remarkable bravery and dedication, for being so blind when they ought to have been more sober. But it would be crueler yet to fail and point out the collective exercise at self-deception that got us here, or to put up with anyone still clinging on to the same ruinous ideas.

We can spend as much time as we’d like discussing the path forward in Gaza, debating the merits of President Trump’s proposal, say, or the military actions still needed to meet Israel’s numerous and complicated goals. What we may absolutely not do, under any circumstance, is to return to the Oct. 6 mindset, to believe that our enemies see the world in the same rational terms as us or that they value anything—the lives of their children, say, or the welfare of their citizens—more than they cherish the systemic annihilation of the Jews. Anyone still chattering about international involvement or humanitarian aid or economic development is simply advocating the eventual repetition of the same costly mistake—only next time, most likely, with a much higher body count.

Israel, then, shouldn’t worry too much about setting up committees of inquiry, as it had done after every major military disaster. The failure this time around wasn’t strategic; it was ontological. Oct. 7 is what happens when an entire society lies to itself for years, refusing to see the evidence staring it right in the face. To maintain their precious dream palace—gilded with billions of dollars from start-up exits, sprawling with top-notch restaurants and shops, and looking a lot more like Berlin or Boston or Milano than the dunes of the Levant, soaked with sweat and blood and religion—Israelis had to convince themselves that the monsters outside could be tamed by an offer of a dream palace of their own. For their wishful thinking, they paid the highest price. Those who indulged in the disastrous delusion that made all this possible may be forgiven; those who continue to champion it cannot be.
