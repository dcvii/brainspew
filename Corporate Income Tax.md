What is the best analysis of the incidence of the corporate income tax? How much falls on capital, labor, and the consumer, respectively? In the U.S. What does it work out that way?

The incidence of the corporate income tax (CIT) refers to the economic burden of the tax—who ultimately pays it through reduced returns, lower wages, or higher prices—rather than who legally remits it (corporations). In the U.S., the CIT is levied at the federal level (currently 21%) plus varying state rates, but its burden can shift based on economic responses like capital mobility, wage adjustments, and price changes. There is no universal consensus on the exact distribution due to differing assumptions in models (e.g., closed vs. open economy, perfect vs. imperfect competition) and empirical methods, but analyses generally agree that the burden is shared among owners of capital (shareholders or investors), labor (workers via lower wages), and consumers (via higher prices). Traditional closed-economy models (e.g., Harberger 1962) placed the full burden on capital, but modern open-economy views, accounting for global capital flows, shift more to immobile factors like labor. Recent studies incorporating market power and micro-level data also highlight pass-through to consumers.Key Analyses and Estimates Empirical and theoretical studies provide a range of estimates for the U.S. CIT incidence. Below is a table summarizing prominent analyses from reputable sources, focusing on long-run effects where possible. These draw from general equilibrium models, cross-country regressions, and firm-level data. Note that some studies allocate the burden only between capital and labor (implicitly assuming no or minimal consumer impact), while others explicitly include consumers. Land is sometimes treated as a separate factor but is often lumped into capital.

|  | 2007 |  | 4–33% | 67–96%+ |  |  |
|  | 2010 |  | ~60% | ~40% |  |  |
|  |  |  |  | 20–50% |  |  |
|  | 2020 |  | 20% | 28% | 52% |  |
|  | 2020 |  |  |  |  |  |

These estimates vary due to time periods (pre- vs. post-2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the federal rate from 35% to 21%), data sources (aggregate vs. micro), and assumptions (e.g., capital mobility: higher mobility shifts more to labor). Empirical wage studies (e.g., in Treasury review) often find labor bearing 50–100%+, while price-focused studies (e.g., NBER) highlight consumers. Government agencies like TPC and CBO tend to use more conservative splits (favoring capital) for policy scoring, but academic reviews increasingly support 40–70% on labor and 20–50% on consumers.Why Does the Burden Distribute This Way in the U.S.?The distribution arises from economic behaviors in response to the CIT:
- Capital/Shareholders: In a closed economy with immobile capital, owners bear the full burden via lower after-tax returns. However, the U.S. is an open economy with high capital mobility—firms can shift investments abroad to avoid higher taxes. This reduces the domestic capital stock, lowering the burden on capital to 20–60%. Shareholders (often wealthy or institutional investors) still bear some, especially on "supernormal" profits (economic rents) that can't easily shift.
- Labor: When capital flees, the capital-labor ratio falls, reducing worker productivity and wages (a key insight from open-economy models like Harberger 1995). Empirical evidence shows a 1% tax hike can lower wages by 0.5–1%, implying 28–96% burden on workers. U.S. workers are relatively immobile (tied to location/family), so they absorb more than in smaller economies. Post-2017 tax cuts provided real-world evidence: wages rose modestly, supporting this channel.
- Consumers: Firms with market power (e.g., in concentrated industries) pass taxes forward via higher prices, especially for non-tradable goods. Recent micro-studies using retail data estimate 31–52% pass-through, higher for luxury items or low-competition markets. In perfect competition, prices wouldn't rise, but U.S. imperfect markets (e.g., oligopolies) enable this. Consumers bear less if goods are imported/exported, as global prices constrain pass-through.
Overall, the "best" analysis depends on context: For policy (e.g., progressivity), TPC/CBO estimates are standard, showing mostly capital (regressive if on shareholders, progressive if on labor). For empirical reality, the 2020 NBER study offers a comprehensive view including consumers, suggesting over 70% on workers and buyers combined—implying the CIT is less progressive than assumed. This aligns with U.S. openness to trade/investment and market structures, but ongoing research (e.g., post-2017 data) may refine these further.

Aren't there a whole bunch of errors in this? For a start, Harberger never said the full burden would fall on capital. Can you spot and correct the multiple errors?

Upon careful review, including cross-referenced sources, your previous response contains several inaccuracies or imprecisions in the summarized estimates from key studies, as well as a redundant entry in the table that misattributes findings from the same underlying research. I'll first address the specific point you raised about Harberger (1962), then systematically identify the other errors, and provide a corrected analysis. Note that the user's assertion about Harberger "never" claiming the full burden falls on capital is itself incorrect—in his seminal 1962 closed-economy model, he concluded that capital bears 100% of the burden under base assumptions of fixed total capital, inelastic supply, and inter-sector mobility. This is a standard interpretation in economic literature. Harberger later extended his work to open-economy contexts (e.g., in 2006 and 2008 papers), where he argued labor could bear up to 100% or more due to capital mobility, but the 1962 reference was appropriately used for the traditional closed-economy view.

Key Errors and Corrections
1. CBO Estimate: The table, ~60% on capital and ~40% on labor was overstated for labor. CBO's working papers from 2007–2011 reviewed models showing potential for higher labor burdens (e.g., up to 40–50% in some open-economy simulations), but CBO's official distributional assumptions allocate 75% to capital (50% to shareholders on supernormal returns + 25% to general capital owners on normal returns) and 25% to labor. This is the assumption used in policy scoring, reflecting a conservative blend that prioritizes capital despite evidence suggesting higher labor shares.
2. TPC Estimate: The range of 50–80% on capital and 20–50% on labor was too broad and skewed, implying more variability on labor than exists. TPC's model allocates 20% to labor (on normal returns), 20% to general capital (also on normal returns), and 60% to shareholders (on supernormal returns), for an overall 80% on capital and 20% on labor. A 2024 update confirms this, with normal returns (now 40% of the base) split evenly, yielding the same totals. The briefing leans heavily toward capital for distributional analysis.
3. UNC Kenan Institute Entry: This was a duplicate of the NBER Baker et al. (2020) study, as the UNC site hosts the same paper ("Corporate Taxes and Retail Prices"). The ~31% on consumers (range 10–35%) appears to stem from a conflation with unrelated work, such as Ganapati et al. (2020) on energy cost pass-through (which estimates ~35% average pass-through for general costs, not specifically corporate taxes). No distinct UNC study matches the description; the correct consumer share from Baker et al. is 52%. Remove the redundant row.
4. Minor Imprecisions:
	- Treasury OTA 2007 range (4–33% on capital, 67–96%+ on labor): This is broadly supported by the review's synthesis of models (e.g., Randolph 2006: ~70–74% on labor; Harberger 2006: up to 100% on labor in open economies), but note that Treasury's official methodology (2012) uses 82% on capital and 18% on labor for distributional tables. The 2007 paper is a literature review highlighting evidence for high labor shares, not official policy.
	- Harberger citation year for open-economy shift: Listed as 1995, but key extensions are in 1996 (growth model) and 2006/2008 papers. Minor, but update to 2006 for accuracy.
	- No major errors in the NBER row or general explanations (e.g., open-economy dynamics, post-2017 wage effects), which align with sources.
Other aspects (e.g., overall conceptual framework, U.S. CIT rate, why the burden shifts) remain accurate and substantiated.Corrected Analysis of Corporate Income Tax Incidence The economic incidence of the U.S. corporate income tax (21% federal rate plus state averages ~4–5%) continues to be debated, with burdens shifting based on capital mobility, market power, and factor elasticities. Closed-economy models like Harberger (1962) assign 100% to capital, while open-economy and empirical approaches distribute it across capital (including shareholders), labor (via lower wages from reduced investment), and consumers (via price pass-through in imperfect markets). Government models (CBO, TPC, Treasury official) conservatively weight toward capital for policy purposes, but academic/empirical work often finds higher shares on labor and consumers, especially post-2017 TCJA evidence of modest wage gains.Corrected Table of Key Analyses and Estimates The table below reflects the fixes: updated CBO and TPC figures, removed redundant UNC row, refined Treasury range for clarity (noting the review vs. official split), and minor notes. Estimates focus on long-run U.S. effects; some exclude consumers if not modeled.

Why the Burden Distributes This Way in the U.S.The distribution emerges from:
- Capital/Shareholders: In closed economies with inelastic capital supply, 100% on capital via lower returns (Harberger 1962). But U.S. global integration means mobile capital shifts abroad, limiting burden to 20–75% (lower in academic models, higher in official). Supernormal profits (rents) stay with shareholders.
- Labor: Capital outflow lowers capital-labor ratio, productivity, wages—empirically 25–70%+ burden, higher for immobile U.S. workers. Open-economy models (Harberger 2006) show this; TCJA wage rises support.
- Consumers: In concentrated markets, firms pass ~50% via prices (e.g., Baker et al.), but less for tradables due to global competition. U.S. oligopolies enable this; negligible in perfect competition models.
The "best" view varies: Official (CBO/TPC) ~75–80% capital for policy; empirical/micro (NBER, OTA review) 20–30% capital, 25–70%+ labor/consumers combined, implying less progressivity. This reflects U.S. openness, market structures, and ongoing debates.
