The success and professionalism of the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro—with complete secrecy maintained and with no Americans killed—may soon look like the easy part. President Donald Trump’s press conference on Saturday left a confused picture of who will do what next—and who the president thinks should govern Venezuela.

It should be easy. In January 2019, [Trump called Maduro](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-trump-recognizing-venezuelan-national-assembly-president-juan-guaido-interim-president-venezuela/) an illegitimate ruler, and in 2020 Maduro [was indicted](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/nicol-s-maduro-moros-and-14-current-and-former-venezuelan-officials-charged-narco-terrorism). In 2024, Maduro stole another election, declaring himself the winner when the democratic opposition forces [won 70 percent](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-machado-says-opposition-candidate-won-70-vote-2024-07-29/) of the vote. His regime has produced the worst mass migration crisis in Latin American history (eight million so far); has engaged in drug, gold, and human trafficking; has allied itself with Iran, Cuba, Russia, and China; and has destroyed democracy and prosperity in what was long a rich and free country. Grabbing Maduro and making him face a jury is a great idea.

But now what? Again, the answer should be easy: The United States should be backing Venezuela’s democratic parties. They united last year under [María Corina Machado](https://www.thefp.com/p/maria-corina-machado-the-woman-who) as their candidate for president, and she would have won the election. When Maduro barred her from running, they united under retired career diplomat Edmundo González as a substitute candidate. Though he was almost unknown in Venezuela, he won a huge landslide because Machado backed him, and because he represented a return to democracy. The unity and effectiveness of the opposition last year were remarkable as it fought an election under the worst circumstances—with the danger of arrest, exile, or worse constantly present, with rallies broken up violently, with no access to state media. Its victory is both a tribute to the opposition leadership and a measure of what Venezuelans want.

But President Trump seems much more concerned with Venezuelan oil than Venezuelan democracy. In his press conference he went out of his way to belittle Machado, stating that she [lacked the necessary “respect](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-torpedoes-nobel-winner-presser-185116576.html) ” from Venezuelans to govern. There is simply no basis for that judgment (or prejudice) given the election results, her courage in remaining in hiding in Venezuela month after month, and now her receipt of the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.thefp.com/p/maria-corina-machado-the-nobel-prize-i-couldnt-give-in-person).

Instead, Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken to Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez. Venezuelan democrats are now wondering whether Trump intends a deal with the remnants of the regime, in which they make all sorts of concessions on oil in exchange for being allowed to hang on.

That is a formula for disaster, and if that’s U.S. policy, Trump will have turned triumph into a new crisis. If Rodríguez hangs on, what of the rest of the regime? Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino is also under a [drug indictment](https://www.state.gov/vladimir-padrino-lopez), as is interior minister and key regime thug and enforcer [Diosdado Cabello](https://2021-2025.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs/releases/2025/01/diosdado-cabello-rondon/). If they stay in office, Trump will have sold our souls for a small amount of oil production.

Venezuela now produces under a million barrels a day and most experts think that could be increased by up to 500,000 barrels this year if sanctions are lifted and U.S. companies help. But the democratic opposition can produce the same increase—and anyway, 500,000 barrels a day in a world market of about 105 million barrels a day would not materially lower gas prices. Moreover, if the Maduro thugs remain in power, there will be more migration and more drug trafficking, exactly what Trump does not want. And the ties to hostile regimes like Cuba and Iran will remain.

Everything Trump says he wants will be the product of a democratic transition in Venezuela. While news stories sometimes warn of another Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan, those comparisons are foolish. Venezuela has a homogeneous population and a strong democratic tradition. There are no social or religious divisions of the sort we see in the Middle East. Democratic institutions existed and need to be revitalized, rather than invented. Last year’s election showed exactly what Venezuelans want, and the country is surrounded by democracies. The only thing that could produce massive unrest and more migration is if the regime holds on—with U.S. support.

Trump has the chance now to help restore to Venezuela a pro-American, free-market democratic government.

This seems so obvious that one has to wonder about the sources of Trump’s information. I understand his allergy to the phrase “regime change,” but that is precisely what is needed, and he is more than halfway there. Were there intelligence analyses suggesting chaos if the regime falls and saying Machado lacked wide respect? If so, they are the biased product of a bureaucracy strongly opposed to the kind of military intervention we saw this weekend.

When I served as Special Representative for Venezuela in Trump’s first term, I found the CIA opposed to doing almost anything there and sour on the democratic opposition. Perhaps that’s still true today. Were there Venezuelan plutocrats or U.S. oil executives coming to Mar-a-Lago and whispering about how easy life would be if we just made a deal with the regime once Maduro was gone? Were they the source of lies about María Corina Machado’s stature?

Trump has the chance now to help restore to Venezuela a pro-American, free-market democratic government. The migration flow would be reversed as many Venezuelans return home to build their own and their nation’s future.

As we have seen with Javier Milei in Argentina and other conservative leaders in Latin America, the best antidote to failing, hostile leftist regimes is usually free elections that allow them to be defeated and replaced. That may not be a global formula, but democracy is stronger in this hemisphere than in most of the world. Democrats throughout the Americas will be wondering tonight whether the United States will follow through to help Venezuelans recover their freedom, or try to “run” Venezuela with the help of the leaders of the discredited regime. President Trump did not give the answer when he spoke Saturday.
