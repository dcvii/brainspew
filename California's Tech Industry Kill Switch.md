California's Tech Industry Kill Switch

it’s not a tax on “wealth,” the union’s ballot prop is designed to target the very concept of founder-controlled companies, and it will force the technology industry out of the state

Jan 12, 2026

Late last year, the architects of California’s “Billionaire Wealth Tax” ballot proposition quietly amended language in their proposal which, if successful, would permanently end the concept of founder-controlled startups in the state — a technology industry kill switch.

Naturally, media discourse surrounding the issue collapsed into a question of “billionaire greed,” with a Teen Bop-esque focus on famous men speaking to each other in group chats on Signal (one group has been reported, in fact there are several). But this isn’t just a tax. This isn’t even just a horrifying first-of-its kind asset seizure that, like income tax, will almost certainly come for all of us. This ballot proposition redefines net worth in such a way that founders are considered owners of anything they control, assessing a founder with 10x voting rights per share in his own company, for example, as being “worth” 10x the dollar value of his equity.

Per the [late November amendment](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/25-0024A1%20%28Billionaire%20Tax%20%29.pdf):

“(C) For any interests that confer voting or other direct control rights, the percentage of the business entity owned by the taxpayer shall be presumed to be not less than the taxpayer’s percentage of the overall voting or other direct control rights.”

Question: what is 5% of 10x everything you actually own?

Come Election Day, if this proposition lands on the ballot and succeeds as written, founders throughout the industry who haven’t already left will not only be forced to sell control of their companies, many could go bankrupt. (Yes, literally).

Following conversations with 15 prominent billionaires in tech who would be impacted by the policy directly, I can confirm the redefinition of ownership as control has especially shocked industry leaders, many of whom donated to men like Congressman Ro Khanna, who has since publicly supported the ballot proposition. If these men are not already leaving the state, they have a plan to leave. Not in protest, but because it is the only way for them to guarantee control of their companies.

“The Billionaire Tax Act” is backed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, supported by the hard and union left of the Democratic Party, and opposed by machine democrats like Gavin Newsom, who seem to be worried (correctly) not only about capital flight, but what this means for the party’s donor base. Currently, the policy is on course to work as its architect, the malevolent dark elf Robert Reich, apparently intended — unless, and I genuinely don’t know how this is possible, he really is too stupid to understand what he just did.

Last week, after news broke surrounding Google’s Sergey Brin and Larry Page’s official exit from California, our left-wing press responded with predictable idiocy: this is just an itty bitty widdle tax, [argued the *LA Times*](https://x.com/latimes/status/2010338665092755904?s=20), and, rather than pay their “fair share,” technology founders are fleeing the state that made them rich with money that belongs to California citizens.

It’s an almost word-for-word rehash of stories we read back in 2020, when San Francisco’s local government decided crime was de facto legal after a new tax, also passed by vote, [disproportionately targeted companies like Stripe](https://www.piratewires.com/p/prop-catastrophe) and Square to fund the city’s sprawling homeless industrial complex. (homelessness has since increased). At the time, the press argued tech founders exiting the city had “extracted” wealth from the state, as if microcode were oil pumped from the ground, and fled with property that actually belonged to teachers and nurses and bus drivers. I thoroughly dismantled this idea in *Pirate Wires* ’ first (historic) viral piece, [Extract or Die](https://www.piratewires.com/p/extract-or-die). California doesn’t make talented, productive people wealthy. Talented, productive people make California wealthy.

But we are well beyond that now.

In 2020, the state’s most productive residents mulled the question of how much abuse they were willing to take in exchange for living in a state they loved. It was the stuff of opinion, with plenty of understandable disagreement. But in 2026, founders in particular are not leaving or planning to leave because they’re angry, or they want to hold onto a few more millions (which they earned, and already pay taxes on). They’re leaving because they have no choice.

As we covered in *Pirate Wires* [back in November](https://www.piratewires.com/p/relax-its-just-the-end-of-private), the ballot prop would impose a “one-time” 5% asset seizure on residents with a net worth over $1 billion, including everything from cash, property, and the watch on your wrist to, most insanely, illiquid and unrealized equity. Ostensibly, this is being done so poor Californians can finally have healthcare, but actually, as I uncovered in November, it’s largely notabout Californians at all. Due to cuts to federal Medicaid spending, California is anticipating upwards of a $100 billion budget shortfall, maybe more, in the state’s healthcare system over the next five years. Thus, the talking point from the union behind the asset seizure is roughly: we have to levy this “ [one-time, emergency tax](https://pro.stateaffairs.com/ca/economy-business/california-billionaire-wealth-tax-proposal) on around 200 to 300 people” to keep *emergency rooms* from *going bankrupt*. What the heroic, emergency room-saving union leaves out is California’s state-funded healthcare programs are, uh, generous: new state legislation, for instance, guaranteed taxpayer-funded healthcare for all illegal immigrants at a cost of something like $12.5 billion last year.

Go ahead, do the math.

In any case, the motivation behind a proposition so obviously and deeply destructive, while interesting in the same way one finds the behavior of locusts, is not so important as what it means for the industry it was clearly designed to punish.

In tech, the use of dual-class or “super-voting” share structures is common to the point of standard, employed at Alphabet, Meta, Snap, Airbnb, DoorDash, Lyft, Coinbase and many more. Targeting founders with a tax they mostly can’t afford is, for the industry in California, genuinely existential.

On X, this is where prominent tech leaders have mostly focused. Garry Tan was first to [break down the economics](https://x.com/garrytan/status/2009776299666223265?s=43) that forced out Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page:

> “Larry and Sergey can’t stay in California since the wealth tax as written would confiscate 50% of their Alphabet shares.
> 
> Each own ~3% of Alphabet’s stock, worth about $120 billion each at today’s ~$4 trillion market cap.
> 
> But because their shares have 10x voting power, the SEIU-UHW California billionaire tax would treat them as owning 30% of Alphabet (3% × 10 = 30%). That means each founder’s taxable wealth would be $1.2 trillion.
> 
> A 5% wealth tax on $1.2 trillion = $60 billion tax bill, each.
> 
> That’s 50% of their actual Alphabet holdings — wiped out by a ‘5%’ tax.”

Let’s try this one more time, because the math here is important. If you own 10% of a company worth $10 billion dollars, but you have 10x voting rights, this ballot prop indicates you will be assessed as having a net worth of 100% of your company’s valuation. This means you will be taxed 5% of $10 billion dollars, rather 5% of the $1 billion dollars you are only theoretically worth*.* That is $500 million dollars.

Let’s say you’re a founder bringing in a few hundred thousand dollars a year. Hell, let’s say your salary is $1 million a year (unheard of). You now owe $500 million dollars. How are you going to pay this? Sure, you’re worth $1 billion… on paper. But that’s all just equity in your company, and that equity is all you have to sell.

So you try to sell half of your stake in the company you built. Under duress. This is to say, your absolute best case scenario here results in your having half of everything you own seized by the government. Worst case scenario, you can’t sell enough of your company to pay your tax bill, and you literally go bankrupt. There is a reason the government has never done this before, and it’s not because it’s scared of taxing people.

This ballot proposition is designed to kill startup founders.

“It makes founder-led companies practically illegal,” [put Palmer Luckey](https://x.com/palmerluckey/status/2009811828231356610?s=43) most succinctly. The sentiment was [echoed by DoorDash founder](https://x.com/andyfang/status/2010418126610186585?s=20) Andy Fang in a post explaining his exit from the state.

There is a sort of multi-layered unfairness here, beginning with the concept of a wealth tax, some of which I first addressed in November, and which David Friedberg did a [great job unpacking](https://x.com/friedberg/status/2005172467485020239?s=43) last week:

> “you’re masking that you are proposing the creation of, for the first time in the 250 years of this American republic, an organized government seizure of private property from citizens.
> 
> you’re calling it a “wealth tax” or a “billionaires tax” or “millionaires tax” or whatever nom du jour polls well. but at the end of the day, it’s the seizure of private property from citizens by the government. citizens that earned money, paid their fair taxes on those earnings (53% if they live in California) and are now being told they need to hand over after-tax assets because the government has failed to provide promised services with the revenue it’s collected, and are now re-casting their own failure to be a socio-economic inequity that must be justly resolved... a slippery slope that has never gone anywhere good (see economic effects in USSR, Cuba, Venezuela, France and Norway wealth tax etc.)”

Then, as currently written, many founders targeted will not actually be able to pay their tax bill, which of course betrays the heart of this ballot prop from hell: the asset seizure is designed to disproportionately target startup founders, and not even because they are wealthy. But because they are in control of their companies. Because they are a class of men with power that constitutes the only check against far left union power in the state. Or at least, this is my theory.

But the most alarming thing I’ve learned this week in conversation with so many men targeted by the proposition is it doesn’t seem to matter to them if it winds up on the ballot this November or not, or if it passes, or why people in the state would so dogmatically pursue a path of self-destruction. After Ro Khanna came out in support of the proposition, and then downgraded his support to merely a “wealth tax” conceptually, general sentiment turned. The chaos of Californian direct democracy, openly supported by a politician meant to be Silicon Valley’s representative in Congress, led most industry leaders to the same conclusion: without significant, systemic change to the state’s government, this or something like it is inevitable. And systemic change to our government isn’t coming.

I’ve counted around $1T in wealth that has fled the state already, but this is nothing to the second order impact of the flight. Again, much like the stock price of a tech company, the value of the technology industry exists almost entirely in the future. Larry and Sergey are great guys who’ve done great things but who do not really matter. Young startup founders matter. And for startup founders who believe they are building a company worth at least $1 billion (hint: fucking all of them) it is no longer safe to build in California.
