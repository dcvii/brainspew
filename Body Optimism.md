Most people will read this and think optimists live longer because they eat better and exercise more. The study says something wilder.

Lee et al. controlled for smoking, diet, exercise, alcohol, depression, BMI, and socioeconomic status. The longevity effect still held. The most optimistic quartile lived 11 to 15% longer and had 1.5 to 1.7x odds of reaching 85 even after removing every behavioral difference.

Which means something is happening at the level of biology, not just habits.

Rozanski’s meta-analysis across 229,391 participants found optimists carry 35% lower cardiovascular event risk. Blackburn’s Nobel Prize-winning lab at UCSF found pessimistic attitudes are associated with accelerated telomere shortening. Cortisol suppresses telomerase, the enzyme that rebuilds the protective caps on your chromosomes. So chronic negative expectation literally erodes the structures that keep your cells from aging.

The loop runs: pessimistic cognitive style → sustained HPA axis activation → elevated cortisol → telomere degradation → accelerated cellular senescence. Optimists interrupt that loop at the top. They show less emotional reactivity to stressors, faster recovery from acute stress, and they default to reframing threats as challenges rather than catastrophizing.

The part nobody talks about from this paper: the authors explicitly state optimism is modifiable. This isn’t a personality trait you’re born with. Cognitive reappraisal training, morning sunlight for cortisol rhythm regulation, deliberate breathing protocols for vagal tone, structured gratitude practices. All of these shift the prefrontal cortex patterns that determine where you sit on the optimism spectrum.

A 35% reduction in cardiac events from a trainable psychological variable is a bigger effect size than most supplements on the market. That’s the real story buried in this abstract.

What stands out to me isn’t just that optimism helps people live longer, but why. It seems to change how the brain interprets stress. When something feels like a “threat,” the body stays in high-alert mode. When it feels like a “challenge,” the body can settle and adapt.

@grok how much of this do you think is due to healthy people people with good genes generally having a better experience of life which makes them optimistic. And that it’s the genes leading to good outcomes that is the true driver of health, not the optimism which is a byproduct

Did they control for early life trauma/differences? Just wondering how much of what we call an optimist is just a person who learned at an easy age tbe world is a generally safe place vs those who learned to expect pain.

This is a fascinating body of research — but it’s worth adding some nuance.

Yes, studies like those led by Laura D. Kubzansky (Lee et al. work on optimism and longevity) and meta-analyses by researchers such as Alan Rozanski show strong associations between optimism and lower

Optimism isn’t just mindset fluff. It’s stress regulation. If chronic pessimism keeps cortisol high and shortens telomeres, that’s biology not vibes

Yeah ok and what baseline privileges did the study participants have to begin with here? Were any of them disabled or chronically ill? Were any of them living in war zones or abusive relationships?

The idea that life improvement is just an attitudinal shift away fuels a million

@grok can you pull links for Rozanski’s meta-analysis and Blackburn pubs referenced here?

Participants tested \*once\* for their optimism levels over all the years they were tracked.

Participants were nurses and veterans and "predominantly white and were married".

I'm almost certain this is completely bunk science but I wouldn't be able to say exactly how.
