***Welcome back to our America at 250 faith series, where Free Press writers reflect on belief, history, and the freedoms that shape American life. On Wednesday, Matthew Walther [wrote about](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-great-american-religious-attic) our country’s religious kaleidoscope—and the history that birthed it. Today, Rabbi David Wolpe reflects on how two very brilliant but very different religious writers—the Boston Brahmin Emerson and Polish Hasidic émigré Heschel—strike so many similar notes of American faith. There’s no better moment to bring these “Apostles of Amazement” into your life. —The Editors***

Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston in 1803 and raised within the liberal Protestant culture of New England. Abraham Joshua Heschel was born in Warsaw in 1907, scion of [two Hasidic dynasties](https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/opinion/343149/the-enduring-and-challenging-legacy-of-abraham-joshua-heschel/).

Emerson was born into his language, crafting sentences whose sturdy majesty shaped the American idiom. Heschel learned [English as an adult](https://www.americamagazine.org/from-our-archives/2007/06/18/lovingly-observant/) yet he, too, grew into an extraordinary American writer. Emerson left his position as a pastor and became an independent lecturer. Heschel remained a devout rabbi his entire life, tied to an academic institution, producing books of scholarship in Hebrew and Yiddish as well as more popular works in English.

Nonetheless, together this [Boston Brahmin](https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/brief-history-boston-brahmin/) and Polish Jew strike a polychord of American faith: They are the apostles of amazement. For each, faith was not an argument but a reflex of the soul. Both proclaimed an American scripture written not by creed but by consciousness.

Both men came of age as the world convulsed. Emerson’s adulthood was marked by the struggle over slavery and the violence of the Civil War. Heschel fled the firestorm of Europe, later and [protesting the Vietnam War](https://heschel.jtsa.edu/heschel-and-the-viet-nam-war/). Both understood that ideas were not abstractions—they had consequences in a contentious world.

Deep loss marked both lives: Emerson buried a young wife and then a beloved son. Heschel lost one of his sisters in the German bombing of Warsaw and his mother and two other sisters in the Holocaust, and carried the anguish of a world destroyed. Both, though, were convinced of the naturalness of faith. “We are born believing. A man bears beliefs as a tree bears apples,” [Emerson wrote](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/the-conduct-of-life/worship/). It was said of Heschel by a fellow theologian that he had “no feeling for the tragedy of unbelief.”

I have long loved the legacies of both these men. When studying and later teaching at the [Jewish Theological Seminary](https://www.jtsa.edu/) on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, I would often pass Heschel’s old office (he died in 1972) and wonder what it would have been like to study with him. When I taught at Harvard Divinity School, it was a special thrill to step onto the lectern where Emerson had delivered one of the seminal orations of American history, the Divinity School address. He was 35 years old when he [told the graduating class](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/nature-addresses-lectures/addresses/divinity-school-address/) of a seminary that intuition, not tradition, was the source of authority, and that we should “dare to love God without mediator or veil.”

We are celebrating the 250th anniversary of the birth of America in a time of polarization, pessimism, and uncertainty as to our purpose. The optimists sound naive; trust flows to the voices who mock, condemn, and foretell doom. Emerson and Heschel are two hopeful and prophetic voices, different in tradition, but each preaching an independence and a willingness to be enchanted by God’s world and to embrace the greatness of this nation. They give what so few writers give us: a different way of being in the world. To say they are inspiring is insufficient; they are reorienting. Each in his own way takes your soul in both hands and shifts it slightly so it fits differently into reality.

Heschel does so as a man bound by tradition—he was a practicing Jew—while Emerson released himself from its bonds as a swimmer slips into open water. Yet both feel expansive in their spiritual sweep, absorbing the fertile possibilities of a spacious land. Emerson saw God “ [in every moss and cobweb](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/essays-first-series/compensation/).” “To be spiritual,” Heschel insisted, “is to be amazed.” I used to tell my students that for [Martin Buber](https://iep.utm.edu/martin-buber/), creator of the [I-Thou philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/I-Thou), to sense God you had to wake in the morning and look in the eyes of the person lying next to you. For Heschel, you need only open your eyes. Existence is enough: “Just to be is a blessing. Just to live is holy.”

Throughout his life, Emerson declaimed [an immanent](https://www.britannica.com/topic/immanence-divine-attribute) and impersonal God. He flowed through the human soul. To have faith in oneself, in the divine in human beings, was Emerson’s American declaration. “Trust thyself: Every soul vibrates to that iron string,” he cried in his magnificent essay on “ [Self-Reliance](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/essays-first-series/self-reliance/).” Henry James, whose family was close to Emerson’s, wrote after his death, “We have the impression, somehow, that life had never bribed him to look at anything but the soul.” Emerson was a unique combination of sage and saint, venerated in his time and studied endlessly after.

Heschel—knowing how fragile, forgetful, and fearful human beings could be—trusted the inner voice less. His outlook was tempered by escape from a world where piety did not save the pious and learning did not humanize the learned. Heschel was once walking to synagogue on the Upper West Side when a man stopped him to say he never attended services.

“I’m a good person,” the man explained. “I try my best; I don’t need prayer or God.”

Heschel smiled. “How I envy you,” he said. “I’m always saying the wrong thing, wounding those I love, forgetting to offer a kind or gentle word. I need synagogue.”

Heschel was unable to ignore the pain people inflict upon one another, leading him to declare: “An act of injustice is condemned, not because the law is broken, but because a person has been hurt.” For Emerson, the moral life blooms from internal awareness; for Heschel, from answering a call beyond ourselves.

These two voices speak clearly to our dispirited world. Emerson [tells us](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/nature-addresses-lectures/addresses/literary-ethics/) that “the perpetual admonition of nature to us is, ‘The world is new, untried.’ ” And for Heschel, “Our goal should be to live life in radical amazement.” Both feared the deadening of habit, a slow calcification of spirit, the way routine wraps around a soul like a vine choking a tree. Emerson had a wonder that was cosmic; Heschel’s was covenantal.

Both wrote poetry; both worked for the liberation of the oppressed; both stood within and outside their communities; and both pleaded for a religious renewal based on sensitivity of the soul.

In Heschel’s and Emerson’s words is an appreciation of the natural world that we too often ignore or unthinkingly exploit. We live among wonders and yet do not recognize the blessings that surround us. Emerson: “ [If the stars](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/nature-addresses-lectures/nature2/chapter1-nature/) should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore.... But every night come out these envoys of beauty and light the universe with their admonishing smile.” Heschel: “ to take notice of what is beyond our sight, content with converting realities into opinions, mysteries into dogmas, and ideas into a multitude of words. What is extraordinary appears to us habit, the dawn a daily routine of nature.”

Yes, Emerson’s night and Heschel’s dawn recur every day. Deep appreciation is to recognize that the world does not grow dull though our vision may. To read each is to absorb, as if for the first time since childhood, the luminous ordinary.

Both cried out for a faith that is electric, not to soothe but to arouse. In a time seduced by a sense of purposelessness, how apt is Heschel’s reminder of life’s slow, unfolding meaning? “In our own lives the voice of God speaks slowly, a syllable at a time,” he wrote in *[God in Search of Man](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780374513313),* his deepest exploration of his philosophy. “Reaching the peak of years, dispelling some of our intimate illusions, and learning how to spell the meaning of life experiences backwards, some of us discover how the scattered syllables form a single phrase.”

Such wonder is not a mere indulgence, but also a call for moral courage. Although [not as radical or committed](https://share.google/5HJmoHjI9DoAbg4vV) as some abolitionists, Emerson [spoke out consistently](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/emerson-on-anti-slavery) against slavery and, while he feared civil war, supported the North wholeheartedly when it came, insisting, slavery “poisons and depraves everything it touches.”

Heschel, still dealing with that legacy a century later, marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, Alabama. Afterward he famously declared that he felt his “ [legs were praying](https://heschel.jtsa.edu/march-on-selma/).” Heschel powerfully identified the immorality of ignoring social problems: “In a free society, some are guilty, but all are responsible.” In his [essay on “Nature](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29433/29433-h/29433-h.htm),” Emerson wrote that “the moral law lies at the center of nature.” [Heschel spoke](https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/heschel-religion-and-race-speech-text/) of a “God of pathos,” deeply invested in human kindness. Each preached a faith that would arouse conscience and not anesthetize it.

Most of us do not feel the freshness of America’s promise. As a rabbi I have spent my life trying to console and to uplift my community, yet I have seen them grow increasingly dispirited in the past few years. While acknowledging the fears, something inside of me refuses to believe that disillusion is the same as truth. I remain resolutely hopeful while understanding that part of hope is the determination to struggle against the darknesses of the world. Part of my hope is that these two voices echo in my head.

For the Concord sage and the Polish immigrant, America’s newness encouraged openness to spiritual experience in their respective traditions. Both wrote poetry; both worked for the liberation of the oppressed; both stood within and outside their communities; and both pleaded for a religious renewal based on sensitivity of the soul, in wonder at the existence of God’s world and the potential nobility of the human. Heschel used to love telling [the story](https://www.ohevdc.org/sermon?post_id=927284) of the failed blacksmith who had every skill but the essential one—he did not know how to kindle a spark. He and Emerson stand as two kindlers of the spark of American spirit that has illuminated our nation and the world. Each urges a renewed appreciation for the mystery beyond ourselves. They stir us to recognize radiance.

Late in his life, Heschel said that he asked God for one thing— [for wonder](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780824505424) —and God had granted his prayer. Similarly, Emerson speaks of the moment, standing on the bare ground, when “I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me.” They shared the enchantment with which the world sparkles for the attuned spirit.

Emerson and Heschel, different in so many ways, epitomize the genius and scope of this promised land. From two different wells, they brought forth the same injunction: Awaken, engage, and live in amazement.
