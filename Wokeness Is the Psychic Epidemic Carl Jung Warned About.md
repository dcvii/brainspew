Wokeness is not merely a political ideology. It is the outward expression of poor collective mental health—a modern psychic epidemic that valorizes victimhood and exhibits a disturbing attraction to reality distortion. In *[Civilization in Transition](https://www.amazon.com/Civilization-Transition-C-G-Jung/dp/0415065798/ref=sr_1_5?crid=8F6YDP4BIC98&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yhgW7mjIsq-DqrlUcCzoW8WFv3FQx2GUKnYicOMflxZxICP99Opgv3BS9qV4TQehe_yVP_hOa7b2ItnDTw35nA.VPjNEBD9hP5y7Ad8zbV-7mPUKQrTCkNdGdQyGOpjWHo&dib_tag=se&keywords=civilization+in+transition+jung&qid=1768171282&sprefix=civilization+in+transition+jung%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-5)*, Carl Jung predicted this would be humanity’s greatest danger.

“It is becoming ever more obvious that it is not famine, not earthquakes, not microbes, not cancer, but man himself who is man’s greatest danger to man—for the simple reason that there is no adequate protection against psychic epidemics, which are infinitely more devastating than the worst of natural catastrophes.”

Jung used the term psychic epidemic to describe moments in history when mental illness becomes the norm rather than the exception—when societies lose their grip on reality and pathological thinking spreads socially, not individually. Today we call that epidemic [wokeness](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/mark-dsouza-the-wolf-of-wokeism): the sanctification of race, gender identity, and climate.

Consider a few beliefs now treated as respectable:

- That Western countries should avoid developing domestic energy while importing it from authoritarian regimes—Canada included, [importing oil from Saudi Arabia](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-sources/fossil-fuels/oil-supply-demand).
- That America is a white supremacist country—despite [Asian women out-earning](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2020/women-had-median-weekly-earnings-of-902-in-third-quarter-2020-compared-with-1104-for-men.htm) white men.
- That we cannot define what a woman is.
- Finally, Queers for Palestine.

These fantastical incoherencies thrive in faculty lounges—insulated from consequences—but collapse when imposed on reality.

Mass psychosis is not exclusive to the political left. Claims that [Russia was “provoked” into invading Ukraine](https://mdsouza.substack.com/p/the-last-golden-horde-attack) reflect the same moral inversion—absolving aggression through victimhood. Jung’s warning was not partisan. But today’s dominant, institutionally enforced psychic epidemic is wokeness.

Mass formation, or mass psychosis, occurs when large groups become fixated on particular beliefs under conditions of fear and uncertainty. The psychological dynamics resemble those described by [psychiatrist Silvano Arieti’s](https://www.amazon.com/Interpretation-Schizophrenia-Silvano-Arieti/dp/B000OC48CU/ref=sr_1_1?crid=EIK4HJG1OGWY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.s5A39RIo_MTSqClPqpe7CWjMVoLfGRWxJXojCXA3bVegy_AHkfac4bKAPnY355Tlkv8XLbKkDgPdqPZDvxSOJsDxeh4W1gVGX5Xm3TvAk72toL1DNBuMIgAntO44PvH1jK1aw3TNy4SyB3g8jj-QR1f4biKRy7IdOMsKxiUmypOVkcMq1i6RPbmmC1pfIkDToR_58FprtCO6UY2ARCN1pNZNCxlskEsN5CRgkmkA7T0.FhGESP1cWSMGJUGuO1Oek1j7xlUyCD9l_gcG9IsTwKE&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+interpretation+of+schizophrenia&qid=1768168157&sprefix=the+interpretation+of+schizophren%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-1) in individual psychosis: narrowed attention, emotional amplification, loss of critical thinking, and intense social conformity. Societies then scapegoat groups while believing themselves morally righteous—as in the witch hunts of the 16 <sup>th</sup> and 17 <sup>th</sup> centuries, and the totalitarian movements of the 20 <sup>th</sup> century.

The trigger is often a flood of negative emotion. Arieti argued that when fear and anxiety overwhelm rational coping mechanisms, individuals may resolve these states through delusion. In this framework, a psychotic break is an abnormal solution to overwhelming anxiety—a reordering of reality that blends fact and fiction in a way that restores emotional equilibrium.

Wokeness functions exactly this way, and we have built a culture that actively promotes poor mental health. Social media and smartphones act as accelerants, as psychologist [Jonathan Haidt has shown](https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-020-00296-x/d41586-020-00296-x.pdf). Algorithms reward grievance and revolutionary fervor—not gratitude or truth. “I’m content today” doesn’t go viral. “Everything is oppressive and must be dismantled” does.

The [rising rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Haidt%20Testimony.pdf) among youth—especially girls—have been well documented. Neuroimaging studies show [altered reward-processing pathways](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36595277/) associated with habitual social media use. Haidt distilled this cultural shift into what he called the [three great untruths](https://www.thefp.com/p/why-the-mental-health-of-liberal): what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. These are hardly resilience-building ideas.

Wokeness also promotes splitting—a primitive psychological defense mechanism most commonly associated with certain personality disorders. Splitting divides the world into absolute categories: all good versus all bad. Those who agree with you are virtuous; those who disagree are not merely wrong, but evil. Splitting also fuels the [scapegoating impulse](https://hxstem.substack.com/p/the-oldest-hatred-and-the-blind-spot?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=618970&post_id=177914144&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=34gov&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email): once a group is designated as morally impure, it can do no right, while its adversary can do no wrong. This [devil-halo](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12763008/) pairing is emotionally satisfying and socially unifying, which is precisely why it recurs in every moral panic—from witch hunts to modern activist purges.

Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaigns on university campuses demand total purity. Any association with Israel is treated as irredeemably corrupt, while Palestinian actors, including Hamas, are held to no comparable standard. The rigidity exposes an [ideological Achilles’ heel](https://hxstem.substack.com/p/antisemitism-and-the-judgment-of?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=618970&post_id=177936053&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=34gov&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email). For pro-Hamas activists, the existence of civilian hostages shattered the liberation fantasy—hence the tearing down of hostage posters.

This pattern aligns disturbingly well with Jung’s warning that when societies abandon shared meaning, psychic epidemics follow. Modern data increasingly supports this intuition: wokeness correlates not with flourishing, but with [higher anxiety and depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39182169/), and [lower happiness](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38482728/). Extreme liberals show markedly [higher rates of mental illness than moderates](https://mankindquarterly.org/archive/issue/60-4/3) —a relationship that has persisted across decades of survey data. As psychologist J. D. Haltigan has argued, algorithmic [social media platforms function as incubators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X22000682) for emotionally dysregulated personality traits (e.g., cluster B), rewarding outrage, victimhood, and identity instability—a witch’s brew fueling today’s moral extremism.

The solutions are neither radical nor novel. First, free speech. The pursuit of truth without prejudice reduces corrosive doublethink. Perhaps this is why Charlie Kirk instinctively took the fight to the modern academy: suppressing speech fractures young minds. For example, being told that repeat violent offenders deserve only compassion—while ignoring the families shattered when they’re released—requires a black belt in juggling contradictions.

And if speaking the truth openly feels too costly, at least [live not by lies](https://www.solzhenitsyncenter.org/live-not-by-lies). As Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn argued, even refusing to repeat known falsehoods preserves psychological integrity when overt dissent is dangerous.

Second, personal responsibility. Healthy belief systems locate evil first within the self, not endlessly in others. The zealot, by contrast, projects and scapegoats. “For whoever is not against us is for us” (Mark 9:40) is anathema to modern activist splitting, where even silence is violence. Civilizations unravel when everyone is busy removing specks from their neighbour’s eye while ignoring the plank in their own. For professional activists, personal responsibility would mean building competence, sustaining healthy relationships, and attending to one’s physical and mental well-being—leaving less room for moral exhibitionism.

Third, there’s the stabilizing influence of traditional religion. Longitudinal research has found that [religious participation is associated with lower levels of despair](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39165091/), suicidality, and substance abuse—likely reflecting the psychological and social stability these belief systems provide. As is attributed to G. K. Chesterton: “When people cease to believe in God, they do not believe in nothing; they believe in anything.”

Finally, [parallel structures](https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/wp-content/uploads/1979/01/the-power-of-the-powerless.pdf). In communist Czechoslovakia, dissident Václav Havel advocated for independent networks of truth, culture, education, and faith that preserved sanity when the official narrative collapsed, an idea echoed today by organizations like the Heterodox Academy and its STEM Substack. Havel later became his country’s first post-communist president—evidence that such bastions of freedom can serve as incubators of renewal once the deluge of the psychic epidemic passes.

Wokeness is not compassion, but anxiety institutionalized, victimhood moralized, and reality bent to relieve cognitive dissonance. Jung warned that psychic epidemics would be humanity’s greatest threat—because there is no external enemy to fight, only distorted minds to confront. The choice is simple, if not easy: reality, or comforting delusion. Truth, or emotional anesthesia. Sanity, or psychic collapse.

In times of delusion, the task is not to remake the world, but to preserve foundational truths—to build arks of sanity that can withstand the storm, and allow renewal once it passes.
