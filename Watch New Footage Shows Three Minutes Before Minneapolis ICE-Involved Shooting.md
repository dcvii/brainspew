***Update (1410ET):***

Additional footage has surfaced, apparently from a nearby resident, showing at **least three minutes leading up to the ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis** of a left-wing activist who was blocking traffic in an attempt to impede federal agents during a deportation operation.

The **internet has been a battleground of competing narratives**, fighting over which will be the consensus, in which left-leaning corporate media outlets and Democrats say the woman shot and killed did nothing wrong, while the White House and right-leaning outlets have said she was part of "ICE Watch" and part a pressure campaign against ICE.

The Trump administration has sprung into action over the last few days in an attempt to control the narrative and ensure Democrats don't win this narrative fight. Maybe that's because if Democrats succeed, it is clear the party wants a repeat of *['George Floyd 2.0' rio](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/minneapolis-ice-shooting-shows-left-wings-protest-industrial-complex-wants-another-george)* ts.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X,

> *Remember when the media called Abrego Garcia an innocent "Maryland Man," when he was actually an illegal alien, human trafficker, wife beater, and gang member? Minnesota is a different case, but the legacy media is running the same playbook. This woman was not "an innocent mother dropping off her child at school." She was a leftist insurrectionist who was purposefully and illegally obstructing law enforcement operations. More evidence here:*

" **The media suppresses this footage because the truth destroys their narrative. They require your ignorance to maintain control. This is psychological warfare disguised as journalism**," one X user [stated](https://x.com/FinalTelegraph/status/2010060174619488275?s=20).

There are competing narratives about Wednesday’s ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis. Some left-leaning corporate outlets focused on the fact that a woman was shot and killed by an ICE agent during a federal enforcement deportation operation, while other media, like the New York Post, highlighted that the woman, identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was part of a left-wing group " [Ice Watch](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/left-wing-protest-industrial-complex-activates-across-multiple-cities-after-ice-involved) " that mounted pressure campaigns on ICE agents on the ground.

Put aside all those viral videos on X; now *[Alpha News](https://x.com/AlphaNews/status/2009679932289626385?s=20)* has obtained cellphone footage from what appears to be one of the ICE agents, and it provides a completely new perspective on what happened and why the ICE agent felt threatened enough to fire several shots at Good, killing the activist.

The NYPost reported late Thursday night that Good was an anti-ICE "warrior" and part of a network of left-wing activists who worked to "document and resist" ICE operations in Minnesota.

The video from an ICE agent appears to confirm that Good and another individual were obstructing federal agents in the middle of the street.

Vice President JD Vance [commented](https://x.com/JDVance/status/2009686659860988411?s=20) on Alpha News' report, saying, **"What the press has done in lying about this innocent law enforcement officer is disgusting. You should all be ashamed of yourselves."**

**Schhh Shanghai is soaring.**

The Shanghai Composite keeps ripping while China’s latest bull remains oddly under owned with speculation heating up across ChiNext and STAR even as tech lags a setup where breakouts tend to turn violent and catch up trades could suddenly ignite.

**Roaring Russell.**

The Russell is breaking above long-standing resistance with a powerful weekly bull candle as small caps leave tech behind, inflows turn positive, and operating leverage sets up a potential push toward new all-time highs.

What if SPX rejects range highs again just as positioning, seasonality, and tech stress line up the wrong way? With VIX near a floor, skew reset, asset managers and dealers short volatility, and a packed macro-earnings calendar ahead, downside protection suddenly looks cheap — and complacency expensive.

Silver just printed its second straight red candle for the first time since the squeeze began — and momentum is starting to crack. With price slipping below the 8-day, RSI diverging, rebalancing supply looming, and volatility still extreme, the next move could be fast and unforgiving.

**EM keeps working — and nobody owns it**

EM just delivered one of its strongest years — and the setup still looks intact. Growth beats DM, valuations remain discounted, debt levels are lower, earnings momentum is improving, and global investors are still underweight. Simple math. Unloved trade.
