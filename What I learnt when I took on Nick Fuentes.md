‘I hope you become a bar of soap.” “Your dad has become a lampshade, your mum is a pair of shoes.” “Holocaust fairytale peddler.”

It’s been quite a week. Last Monday I made a video about my parents that Piers Morgan used in an interview with a man called [Nick Fuentes](https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/young-men-nick-fuentes-influencer-bhs87k3p5), a 27-year-old American online influencer with a growing following. He believes America has been subverted by rich, powerful Jews. Fuentes had been given an outrageously soft interview a couple of weeks ago by Tucker Carlson and Morgan wanted to redress the balance.

Since part of Fuentes’s schtick is to say that Hitler is really cool and to suggest we celebrate Stalin’s birthday, my video put to him who Hitler and Stalin really were, explaining what they had done to my family. Fuentes responded aggressively, saying that he didn’t care about what some old British guy said about “Me mum” (adopting Dick Van Dyke’s accent from *Mary Poppins*). He later made his own video about “Me mum dying in the Holly”.
