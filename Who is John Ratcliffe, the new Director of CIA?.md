John Ratcliffe

US President Donald Trump has appointed [John Ratcliffe](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/john-ratcliffe) as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), marking Ratcliffe’s second high-profile intelligence role under Trump’s leadership.  
  
Ratcliffe, who was sworn in as the 25th CIA Director, is the first person in US history to have held both [CIA Director](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cia-director) and [Director of National Intelligence](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/director-of-national-intelligence) (DNI) positions. He previously served as DNI during Trump’s first administration, overseeing the nation’s intelligence agencies amid the coronavirus pandemic and concerns over foreign election interference in 2020.  
  
During his tenure as DNI, Ratcliffe accused Iran of attempting to intimidate US voters through targeted emails and faced backlash for declassifying Russian intelligence reports that alleged damaging information about Democrats in the 2016 election—a move critics called politically motivated.  
  
Before entering the intelligence sector, Ratcliffe was elected to Congress in 2014 and became a strong Trump ally, particularly during Trump’s first impeachment trial. He was an outspoken critic, calling the process "the weakest impeachment our country has ever seen."  
  
Ratcliffe’s nomination as DNI in 2019 initially faced strong opposition, leading to his withdrawal within days. However, Trump renominated him in 2020, and he was confirmed by a divided Senate.

Synopsis

Mission Vision, a public health initiative, has been launched in India to combat the escalating crisis of vision loss due to Diabetic Retinopathy. The initiative aims to increase awareness, improve screening and treatment access, and integrate eye care into routine diabetes management.

[![MSME 2025](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-123559614/msme-2025.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etspotlight/etmsmeawards?utm_source=DP&utm_medium=300x50_banner "MSME 2025")

A staggering public health crisis is unfolding in India, the world's diabetes capital, leading to a surge in irreversible vision loss from conditions such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).  
  
This disease damages the retina, the eye's crucial ‘reel’, and often strikes people in their most productive years. Lack of awareness remains a primary concern, with nearly [90%](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8725073/) of diabetic patients having never had a retinal exam and seeking help only after permanent damage has occurred. The problem is worsened by a severe shortage of specialists and the failure to integrate eye care into routine diabetes management.  
  
To combat this escalating threat, Mission Vision, a public health initiative by The Vitreo Retinal Society of India (VRSI) and The Times of India, with support from Roche, was launched in July 2025. Under the Mission Vision initiative, a VRSI-led multistakeholder task force called the VIEW (Vision Improvement Experts Working) Council is putting together a comprehensive roadmap to tackle DR and make retinal health a national priority.

Strategies to address gaps in awareness, screening, diagnosis and treatment, infrastructure, and capacity-building were discussed. When implemented, these potential solutions could preserve the sight of millions who are at risk today.  
  
The following key actionables emerged from the discussion:  
**A clarion call for nationwide awareness  
**A nationwide awareness campaign, similar to the Pulse Polio programme, is essential to address preventable blindness so that people can take action before it is too late.  
  
Emphasising the need for a collaborative approach, Dr R. Kim, President, VRSI and Chief Medical Officer, Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, said, “There are many people doing a great job of reaching patients, but it is happening in pockets. We must integrate the entire network: primary care physicians, diabetologists, optometrists, and chemists to ensure that every patient with DR is identified early on and taken care of. It is about starting a national conversation where every patient asks for an eye exam. We cannot afford to lose another person's vision to silence.”  
  
**To achieve this, the following were suggested:**  
- Multi-stakeholders through different channels to maximise awareness
- Implement government mandates to ensure systemic integration
- Sensitise and leverage the existing healthcare ecosystem, including community (e.g. ASHA workers)
- Collaborate with trusted NGOs for nationwide scale, trust, and reach
  
**Push for mandatory DR screening**  
Policy reform is crucial to make DR screening a fundamental right for every diabetic patient by 2030. Dr Manisha Agarwal, General Secretary, VRSI and HOD, Vitreo Retina Dept, Dr Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital, New Delhi, said, “Currently, Ayushman Bharat includes DR screening in 12 states but only upon submission of an OCT photograph, which restricts its use by physicians who may not have an OCT machine. Expansion of DR screening to all states and the implementation of scalable screening models can improve DR detection significantly.”

The experts advocated for making annual DR screening a standard part of diabetes care. To facilitate this, screening must be linked to a patient's digital health ID or Aadhaar for effective tracking and follow-up. While screening and diagnosis are the start of the patient journey, the inclusion of intravitreal injections in Ayushman Bharat can go a long way towards improving access to treatment for DR, said most experts.

Speaking on the need for coordinated action, Roche Pharma’s Rajwinder (Rajji) Mehdwan said, “The question is not if we can eliminate preventable vision loss, but how soon we act to build a future where sight is accessible for all. Roche is committed to bringing its global healthcare ecosystem shaping expertise to make Mission Vision a reality.”  
  
**Building a robust screening-to-treatment pathway**  
A robust referral system is needed to ensure patients diagnosed with DR receive proper, timely treatment. Dr Vishali Gupta, Chief of Retina and Uvea Services at PGI, Chandigarh, said, “One of the biggest hurdles for timely treatment is in getting patients to the right retina specialist, as the referral pathways in these cases are fragmented. There is a need for a holistic national referral pathway so that we all know what a patient’s journey looks like and ensure every patient gets access to specialised retinal care that they need.”

An accountable, pyramid model and significant upskilling of the healthcare workforce were suggested through the following actions:  
- Implement uniform postgraduate training so all ophthalmologists can confidently perform dilated retinal exams.
- Train ASHA workers for doorstep identification, and skill nurses and primary care physicians to administer prescribed intravitreal injections.
- Train technicians to use low-cost, AI-enabled devices for grassroots screening, sending images to central hubs for specialist diagnosis.
  
**Driving systemic change through policy reform**  
Experts recommended following comprehensive policy changes to manage DR, urging the government to recognise its severe economic impact, particularly on young, productive individuals:  
- Integrate DR screening into the national NCD programme via existing health and wellness centres.
- Expand Ayushman Bharat's DR screening nationwide, remove the mandatory OCT photo for reimbursement, and add coverage for intravitreal injections so that the best treatment options are made available to patients
- Replicate successful state models nationwide, such as Andhra Pradesh’s camera distribution to diabetologists and Kerala’s Nayan Amritham programme.
  
This comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach, driven by collective will and clear policy, is critical to transforming the landscape of retinal health in India. The ambitious journey to safeguard the vision of millions has begun with Mission Vision, aiming for a future where sight is accessible for all.
