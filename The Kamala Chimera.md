No sentient, compassionate being could begrudge the Democrats this week this small, still moment of relief and even joy. From what seemed like certain Electoral College death, with a candidate who is manifestly mentally and physically incapable of being president for four more years, they are now in the throes of Kamala euphoria. And who could blame them? In an instant, the Democratic ticket is the younger option for American voters; a fresh alternative to the previously dotaged duo; a non-white and female breakthrough, which has already narrowed the Trump lead. It’s a female Obama!

The initial themes Harris deployed, more to the point, seemed solid against Trump: prosecutor vs felon; future vs past; positivity vs hatred. She gave speeches that finally worked. Her [opening ad](https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1816436341703397765) centered a word usually associated with the right in America: “freedom” — to the sound of Beyoncé. And the polls showed a small recovery for the Democrats among black, Latino, and young Brat-ty voters. The swiftness of Harris’ consolidation of support also gave off the hint of a political canniness previously absent from her vice-presidency. And the mainstream media pivoted instantly to hype, hope, excitement and ... amnesia.

Yes, amnesia. With Harris, amnesia is essential. We all have to become unburdened by what we — and, more specifically she — have been. And beneath the enthusiasm linger some obvious, loud, unanswered questions. Why did Biden so quickly put his weight behind a vice president he had previously ignored, sidelined, and regarded — according to almost every media outlet — as something of a [burden](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/11/kamala-harris-vice-presidency-2024-election-biden-age/675439/)? Why has Obama taken his sweet time to endorse her, after calling for an open nominating process? And why did no other viable candidate come forward to challenge her?

The official answer is that a Harris nomination avoided a mess at the convention, quickly united and energized the party, safeguarded Biden’s war chest, and solidified the demographics of the base. Fair enough, and it seems to have worked (although I suspect a little chaos and a fresh face emerging from the convention would still have been preferable).

But there are other plausible explanations for Harris’ unexpectedly sudden dominance. Could it be that Biden and all of Harris’ rivals still expect to lose in November, and Harris is a useful sacrificial lamb? Or that Biden suspects that a Harris defeat would vindicate him in retrospect? Or that the Dem governors knew it would be political death to challenge a black, female candidate for president in a woke party, and see 2028 as by far their best shot?

I suspect it’s a mix of all of the above — and not quite the strategic breakthrough some may want it to be. And Harris’ opening ad takes a bold stand against “chaos, fear and hate” and issues a brave call for freedom, universal healthcare, and public safety. And maybe the platitudinous vagueness of this is just the overture before we get actual proposals or policies. But at some point, Harris is going to have to square what she has said and done in the past with what she proposes to do as president.

Her record on the national stage — from [2019](https://www.foxnews.com/media/webpage-rated-kamala-harris-most-liberal-senator-2019-suddenly-disappears) till now — is that of a super-woke leftist. In [speech after speech](https://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1816461688503177622), and in an [ad she narrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRuF9FSZTlc) just before the 2020 election, she insists on the need for “equity” as well as “equality,” and by “equity” she means that “everyone ends up in the same place.” She is a presidential candidate who endorses “equality of outcomes” over “equality of opportunity,” a position that even Communist China has now abandoned.

One moment in her catastrophic 2020 campaign for the Dem nomination also stood out for me. There was a discussion in a debate about issuing an executive order that would ban all assault weapons. Biden made the simple point that this was not within the president’s constitutional authority: “There are some things you can do [as president]. Many things you can’t.” Harris replied, giggling: “I would just say, Hey Joe, instead of saying no we can’t, let’s say yes we can. And yes we can!” As she said this, she burst into hysterical laughter. Go watch [the clip](https://x.com/DefiyantlyFree/status/1816728173473661116). She’s not a serious person.

In the only primaries outside California she campaigned in, she favored [decriminalizing](https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/opinion/kamala-harris-wont-fix-bidens-open-border-she-doesnt-even-think-illegal-immigration-is-a-crime/) illegal border crossings and compared ICE to the KKK. On June 1, 2020, as BLM riots were so spreading out of control that even the NYT had an [A1 story the day before](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/george-floyd-protest-minneapolis.html) — “Appeals for Calm as Sprawling Protests Threaten to Spiral Out of Control” — she tweeted out a bail fund for those arrested in the rioting, and urged people to donate. As the chaos surged in June, she [told](https://x.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1815441836061663397) Stephen Colbert:

> They’re not going to stop. This is a movement, I’m telling you. And everyone beware. They’re not gonna stop … They’re not going to let up and they should not. And we should not.

Also in June 2020, she [said](https://www.discoverthenetworks.org/news/harris-outdated-backwards-to-think-more-police-create-more-safety/) on national television, “It is outdated, and it is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.”

Harris [believes](https://cis.org/Bensman/Kamala-Harris-Immigration-Extremist) illegal aliens should get work authorization and free healthcare. She [favors](https://www.newsweek.com/harris-presidency-would-disaster-women-girls-opinion-1930172) unproven, irreversible medical experiments on gay, autistic, and trans children. She favors, and the Biden administration has enforced, systemic government discrimination against men, whites, Jews and Asians to compensate for past discrimination against African-Americans and women. Her Senate record is [one long series](https://x.com/AmaliaHalikias/status/1816172773204455739) of DEI initiatives. And yes, Biden selected her using a DEI process: [no men](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/biden-woman-vice-president-131309) were to be considered, and in the hysteria of 2020, white women were also seen as [no-go areas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-pressed-again-to-name-a-black-woman-as-his-running-mate/2020/08/10/d383d786-db2d-11ea-8051-d5f887d73381_story.html) for the veep role.

Her record as vice president rivals Dan Quayle’s. Every single media outlet, including all the mainstream ones, said so until last week. No, she wasn’t given the formal title of “Border Czar,” because such a title doesn’t exist. But she was the administration’s “point-person” on immigration and the Southern border, as every media outlet [also told us](https://x.com/banned_bill/status/1816201597929574614) until this week. So she is strongly attached to the Democrats’ weakest issue by far: mass, illegal immigration.

She deserves some pity for this. The Biden administration, unwilling to do anything to stop the illegal influx, stuck poor Harris with the task of so reforming Central America’s dysfunctional countries that no one there would ever want to leave. So of course she failed. She was, in reality, deployed to deflect the issue of mass illegal immigration away from Biden — not to actually do anything. But [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPplSYk4uZs) of her reiterating in weird, somber tones — “Do not come. Do not come.” — added a patina of excruciating cringe.

She’s also obviously incredibly insecure. That laugh is a nervous one — it’s to cover up her awkwardness and her inability to say something that actually means something. All of those [famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBDvUgZmDiQ), [inane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBUXR7dszu0), Jack Handy [ramblings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Y-21jVPY8) about [space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCRn6k-s2pY) or the [passage of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P63NmoEGP1Y) are designed to say something meaningful while [not saying anything concrete](https://x.com/StuDoesAmerica/status/1816266637722452223):

> I think it’s very important, as you have heard from so many incredible leaders, for us at every moment in time, and certainly this one, to see the moment in time in which we exist and are present, and to be able to contextualize it, to understand where we exist in the history and in the moment as it relates not only to the past but the future.

What the fuck does any of that mean? And what does she actually believe in? From locking up criminals as California’s AG to pushing bail for BLM rioters, from imprisoning cannabis users to favoring national weed legalization — is quite a journey. It will be interesting to watch the campaign and see if Harris is able to tell a story of her different political identities that doesn’t amount to pure expediency.

And she is a world-historically bad manager of people. That’s not my view or the view of the GOP. It’s the view of almost everyone who ever worked for her. In just her first year-and-a-half as veep, Harris lost her chief of staff, communications director, domestic-policy adviser, and national security adviser. After three years, she had a [92 percent](https://openthebooks.substack.com/p/vp-kamala-harris-had-92-percent-staff) staff turnover! Only 4 out of an original 47 could stick it out.

She wasn’t much better in the Senate, ranking [#9 out of 114](https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-staffers-toxic-office-culture-dysfunction-2021-7) for highest turnover from 2017 to 2020. Her presidential campaign was plagued by in-fighting, family members — her sister, Maya, in particular — pulling rank, constant leaks to the press, strategic incoherence, and endless resignations and layoffs. She blew threw $40 million and had to pull out two months before Iowa. “You can’t run the country if you can’t run your campaign,” wrote Gil Duran, a former staffer.

If you want to read a classic examination of how not to run a political campaign, check out the [NYT’s retrospective piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html). It’s brutal. Think of how Obama ran his campaigns. Now imagine the exact, polar opposite. That’s All-Drama Kamala. And all the staffers echo the same complaint: she doesn’t do her homework and then berates aides who try to help her. She was [vindictive and toxic](https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-staffers-toxic-office-culture-dysfunction-2021-7) as an employer. In greasy pole Washington, attaching yourself to a veep is a rare chance for access to power, a jewel in the careerist crown. And yet so many ambitious and previously successful people simply [couldn’t work for Harris](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/30/kamala-harris-office-dissent-497290) without quitting in bitterness and disdain.

I raise these issues not to rain on the Democrats’ parade — they deserve a moment of jubilation and relief — merely to recognize the reality they now face. And look: in 2024, who knows what could happen? Maybe Harris’ relative youth (she’s my age!), her sex, her non-whiteness, and her freshness will change the dynamics of the race. She’s certainly off to a strong start, and the MSM will go overboard in celebrating her. Maybe Trump will suddenly seem too old or too nasty or now just too boring in comparison. Maybe he’s peaked way too soon. Maybe ugly personal attacks on her — along with the weirdness of J.D. Vance — could shift things one more time. Maybe Harris is key to preventing black and Latino and youth defections to the GOP. I don’t know. The race remains tight. And anyone predicting anything right now needs to remember where we were just three weeks ago.

But I’ll say this. Harris is one of the weakest and wokest Democratic candidates there is. She cannot credibly appeal to the center after such extreme-left posturing; she cannot run a campaign; she cannot run an executive office; she has never been able to win elections outside the left-liberal, one-party state of California; and she has nothing to offer to those of us who really, really don’t want to vote for Trump but don’t want to unburden ourselves of every moderate or conservative principle we ever had. Apart from that, she’s perfect.

### Dissents Of The Week: Regime Change?

A reader writes:

> A lot of interesting points in your latest column on Trumpism. But it’s hard to see the positive or useful political reconfiguration you’re positing when a core feature of Trumpism is, “You can’t trust election results; so if we lose, it was rigged.” It’s probably the most damaging, worrisome aspect of Trumpism, and tens of millions of Americans — and crucially, the new VP nominee — have signed onto it.
> 
> Ultimately some of the wisest, most prescient words about Trump remain the ones you [wrote](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/04/america-tyranny-donald-trump.html) at the dawn of the phenomenon. You refreshed our memories about Plato. You said late-stage democracy is ripe for the emergence of tyranny. I think that’s a far better gloss on our current state of affairs than your new theory that a Trump-Vance victory may be a “rebirth of sorts” for democracy. 
> 
> It will take a victorious Trump all of 30 seconds to begin discussing the “many, many people saying we should probably change the Constitution” to allow presidents to serve more than two terms. Sorry to be gloomy, but it seems unrealistic to think that the extreme polarization, the massive proliferation of disinformation and conspiracy theories, and the erosion of faith in elections will retreat or dissipate. If anything, they seem to be strengthening and accelerating.

Good points. I made many of them in [my column on J.D. Vance](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-calculation-of-jd-vance-06e). I cannot vote for Trump for these reasons. I don’t disagree with my big picture analysis in 2016, and fear the worst. But that’s precisely why I am hoping for a more coherent conservatism to emerge from the current nihilist strongman cult. I think there’s a chance Vance could help nurture it. So I see that — maybe naively — as a hopeful sign.

Another reader believes I am “missing some of the key reasons why Trumpism has so much appeal”:

> One issue that’s massive but gets almost no debate: the aging of the population means arithmetic gives us no choice but to cut spending, raise taxes, or borrow more. Even the far left recognizes higher spending will need higher taxes. Trump is promising lower taxes and no cuts to Medicare or Social Security — something that doesn’t add up, but its appeal is obvious.
> 
> Honest politics is difficult. One of the main reasons Macron is so unpopular in France is that he raised the retirement age, courageously doing what had to be done. Plus, he recognized that dealing with climate change carries a price tag. The UK has elected a moderate who made limited promises only after Truss exposed the nonsense of new-right economics, and Labour got crushed under the hard left leadership of Corbyn. Also of course, Brexit delivered nothing to the left-behind working class, just as those who get dismissed as arrogant out of touch elitists had predicted.
> 
> While I agree we need fewer illegals, immigrants provide much needed tax revenue, so their absence would further exacerbate our fiscal problems. Trump might try to compensate that by import tariffs, which would add to inflation, as would tax cuts and a smaller labor force as immigrants are removed. 
> 
> Trump’s first term looked OK (until Covid) because Obama left him a growing economy and a reduced budget deficit. Full-blown Trumpism now would be a disaster which we will need to reverse. I only hope we are allowed to.  

I don’t quite see much fiscal discipline on the other side either, though. One more reader for now:

> You wrote, “If you emphasize the danger of political violence, don’t turn a blind eye as BLM burns America’s cities to the ground, or ignore Antifa.” Oh FFS, calm down. Then show me _one_ city that BLM _burned to the ground_. Just one will do. Maybe it’s just hyperbolic chum for your righty readers. Regardless, it really dings you in the eyes of your lefty readers who are sympathetic to some of your views.

I’m guilty of hyperbole. But up to $2 billion in insurance claims make those 2020 riots worse than Watts — or any other civil disturbance.
