[It's a fraud — and  a "betrayal... of affirmative action"](http://nyti.ms/1IM0u6c) — because it's supposed to be about "optimal learning environment for all students," but students congregate on "homogeneous islands" — in "self-affirming enclaves" — and seek "safe spaces" where their viewpoints are not challenged.

Affirmative action only satisfies the Equal Protection Clause because it's believed that diversity is a compelling government interest. If the diversity is a fraud, because students who are the components of diversity don't do what they are supposed to and interact with other students who are not like them, then Bruni is (unwittingly?) arguing that affirmative action is unconstitutional.

But what Bruni is *wittingly* doing is laying a foundation for aggressive university action forcing intermixing of the students who are brought to campus. How? He cites "special funds available to campus groups that stage events with other, dissimilar groups" and changing "the layout of campus walkways" and "the architecture of common areas" to cause more paths to cross, and then he moves on to the part that I loathe, piling on academic requirements:

> Schools should use academic requirements to make sure that students don’t travel a tract that’s too confining and idiosyncratic not just in intellectual terms but in social and demographic ones, too. For example, some science and math concentrations draw a disproportionate number of male students; if those students are not forced to take courses outside their majors, there’s a profound gender imbalance in their academic lives.

Bruni wants viewpoints challenged, so let me challenge his viewpoint that life is *unbalanced* if you have much more of one sex than the other in your life. And even if we go with the metaphor of balance and call it imbalance, what's profound about it? It sounds quite shallow to me. Why isn't part of the diversity the preference for a masculine or a feminine milieu? You ought to have to answer those questions before you burden students with more academic requirements. Why is *forcing* people to fill up their schedule with courses they don't want so damned attractive?

I like that Bruni says schools should "also pay greater heed to how gagged so many politically conservative faculty members and students feel." That's not a solution, though. That's only another recognition of a problem.
