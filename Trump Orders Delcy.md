Trump Orders Delcy

The passage of days has made it clearer that Donald Trump bet on using the institutional devastation that the Chavista regime sought in Venezuela over 27 years to turn its protagonists into the executors of the betrayal against dictator Nicolás Maduro, the immobility of the Armed Forces, and the role of new wards of the empire, under penalty of executing new forceful actions. Although he pays for dozens of articles daily in the international press trying to whitewash his image as a false moderate, it is a fact that Delcy Rodríguez is now the empire's little puppy, who lacks the capacity to make better decisions and that's why until now she has only maintained the repressive apparatus and censorship against Venezuelans while demanding more propaganda to pretend to be strong, loyal, indignant, and now a believer, because this communist invoked God as the only one who decides her fate. But she knows it's Trump.

The Trial

Nicolás Maduro and Cilia Flores were presented on Monday in a New York court. Mark Edward Donnelly, an expert in tax crimes, represents Cilia Flores, while Barry J. Pollack, an expert in litigation of complex financial matters, represents Maduro. Both pleaded not guilty. Ha. The free world remains focused on how their capture constitutes a serious violation of international law. The important thing is that for American justice, that form of capture does not invalidate the trial. So everything continues on track. The next hearing will be on March 17. A key fact: in the new accusation from the Department of Justice, much of the allusions to the Cartel of the Suns were removed, which is now interpreted as a clientelist system that "participates in, perpetuates, and protects" a culture of corruption that enriches itself with drug trafficking. That doesn't mean the cartel doesn't exist, but rather that the legal strategy is limited to demonstrating concrete crimes to be more efficient.

What Has Chavismo Not Done 4 Days Later?

It has not explained why:

\- The Armed Forces did not respond to the military operation. The person responsible for the Ministry of Defense should have been dismissed, but Delcy Eloína ratified him. Therefore, his security and defense failures were a decision.

\- They have not institutionally condemned the military action nor created a commission to investigate it. Nor have they declared the U.S. as an enemy state. On the contrary, they say they are going to cooperate.

\- They have not published a report on the material damages left by the operation or on the local deceased (the lists have been created with statements from various sources), but they did pay honors to the Cubans, thus admitting foreign interference and the violation of sovereignty that Cuba has maintained in Venezuela for decades. They also decreed national mourning for the fallen, but without giving them identity.

\- It decreed the State of External Commotion, which does not suppose a belligerent response to the U.S. but rather continuing to violate the human rights of Venezuelans, who remain under a regime of terror.

So, What Has Chavismo Done These 4 Days?

Let Donald Trump disclose the details of the agreement they made drop by drop. Trump has already confirmed that there will be no elections in Venezuela in 30 days and that his Administration will oversee this country while "rebuilding the oil sector," for which he estimates about 18 months. He assured that during that time a group of his National Security advisors will coordinate Venezuelan management. Additionally, he demanded that Delcy Eloína end relations with China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba before extracting and commercializing our oil, adding that "Venezuela will deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S." to administer and sell it at market prices. He also warned Diosdado Cabello that he will be captured like Nicolás Maduro if he does not facilitate the governability of his little puppy.

What Is Not Going to Happen for Now

The U.S. chose to remove from the equation our greatest recent civic achievement: that a perfect stranger won the 2024 presidential election by a 40-point margin, simply because they prevented María Corina Machado from participating. We have to admit that it is extremely complex to achieve a transition from this corrupt and aggressive dictatorship to a democracy, which will take us more time, but with the certainty that the incentives that today move Delcy and the remaining Chavismo are as aggressive as they are. The bet is that the repressive framework that sustains this gang of corrupt people collapses due to their own fears, ambitions, and survival needs. Without the irregular sale of oil whose profits never entered the public treasury and without their illicit businesses (drug trafficking, weapons, identity for terrorist or paramilitary groups, etc.), there is less cash flow to keep the repressive framework cohesive and it is likely that this will generate more fractures. For Venezuelans, it is imperative that this happens.

We Were Not Prepared for

It is uncomfortable the treatment given to both the leader and the president-elect. It is horrifying to process Trump's statements. It is annoying to deal with the Venezuela experts, but this is a gradual, cumulative operation riddled with discomforts for a people from whom every vestige of dignity has been stripped. Chavismo has no scruples, and it learned to thicken that possibility by committing serious crimes under the shelter of its own impunity. Every time you read someone praising their political skills, send them courteously (and with this I am not being ironic) some data from the many reports on violations of our human rights and crimes against humanity they have committed: they are not great politicians, they are people capable of rearranging themselves in order to preserve their share of power, but that share may now have an expiration date.

Keeping Silent

In Venezuela, we are unable to express our opinion, to stay informed (this only happens through social networks and personal contacts), to reject the roles that the remaining Chavismo distributed, because this is an authoritarian and violent regime. Beyond the structural fear of the repressive apparatus, the prudence in manifesting ourselves before the changes is one of the harshest social lessons we have assimilated among innocent dead, wounded, arrested, disappeared, and tortured. Of course, we hope to see the changes we need crystallized, but we have to deal with the propaganda paid for by Chavismo, the oil lobbies, and the normalizers of the dictatorship, now surrendered to the supposed virtues of the empire's little puppy, and a totally reasonable skepticism, given the amount of disappointments we have accumulated over all these years.

Let's Stay in Touch

Chavismo, now with Delcy at the helm, has not ceased its repression against citizens and journalists. It is using parapolice criminals (called "colectivos") to intimidate the population, to check cell phones to verify if you have any message against Chavismo or in favor of the U.S. operation, while they maintain their governability agreement with Trump. That's how contradictory they are. Citizens must insist on the necessary release of all political prisoners, the dismantling of the Chavismo repressive apparatus, the closure of torture centers (including the clandestine ones), the end of censorship of the media, and the return of democratic parties to their true operators. We need, we continue to need, a legitimate government that arises from the popular will.
