[Skip to main content](https://www.vsp.com/faqs#mainContent)### Where can I find my member ID card and ID number?

---

**No ID card is needed** when you visit a [VSP <sup>®</sup> network provider](https://www.vsp.com/eye-doctor) —just tell them you have VSP, and we'll take it from there! But if you'd like a copy of your ID card for your records, you can [print a card from VSP member account](https://www.vsp.com/my-account/member-id-card).

When you schedule an eye appointment, **your doctor may ask for your VSP member ID or member number**. This may be the last four digits of your (the primary subscriber’s) social security number or a unique ID given by your employer (if you are enrolled through your workplace).

**If you have dependents covered under your vision plan** and they are asked for a member ID, they should use the same one you do (the last four of the primary subscriber’s social security number or a unique ID from the primary subscriber’s employer).

### How do I submit a claim for reimbursement?

When you visit an in-network provider, no claim forms are needed. But, if you go out of network, you can submit a claim for reimbursement online from your [VSP member account](https://www.vsp.com/my-account) or by [contacting VSP Member Services](https://www.vsp.com/contact-us) at **800.877.7195** and requesting a claim/reimbursement form.  
  
When submitting a claim, you’ll need:

- Your [completed claim form](https://www.vsp.com/claims/submit-oon-claim).
- An itemized receipt that includes:
	- Name of the provider (ex. doctor, office, website, or retailer).
	- Name of the patient.
	- The date the service was received (ex. Date of exam or the date glasses were ordered).
	- A complete description of each service and the amount paid for each service.
