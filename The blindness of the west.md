### My discussion at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424)

I am in America promoting my new book at various events. While in Washington DC, I was delighted to join Cliff May, president of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, on the FDD’s podcast **[Foreign Podicy.](https://www.fdd.org/podcasts/2025/05/08/melanie-phllips-on-who-built-the-west-and-who-can-save-it/)**

Among the topics we covered was whether diaspora Jews can still happily combine their Jewish and civic identity; the BBC’s key role in incitement against Israel and the Jews; the onslaught by western elites against the core institutions and values of the west; why classical paranoid antisemitism is at the core of progressive identity politics; whether the Trump administration is being played for a sucker by Iran; western blindness over the danger of Qatar; and why Netanyahu is no Churchill.
