**Would you like to know more about his specific writings on Stoicism or his work with Free Black Thought?**

---

Show me his Stoicism

---

Michael David Cobb Bowen's Stoicism is not a dry recitation of ancient texts; it is a **pragmatic, "field-tested" operating system** he uses to navigate modern culture, data engineering, and racial identity. He often refers to himself as an **"OODA Buddha"** (referencing the military OODA Loop—Observe, Orient, Decide, Act), signaling a blend of tactical decision-making and philosophical detachment.

His specific brand of Stoicism can be broken down into three main pillars:

### 1\. "Stoic Racelessness"

This is his most distinct philosophical contribution. Bowen applies the Stoic discipline of **assent** (controlling how one judges impressions) to the concept of race.

- **Rejection of the Construct:** He argues that race is a "social construction" that only has power if individuals grant it power. He chooses to withdraw his assent from racial categories.
- **"Disable the Racial":** In essays like *"Disable The Racial,"* he argues that one should not merely be "anti-racist" (which he sees as still operating within the racial framework) but **"anti-race."**
- **Individual Agency:** He believes relying on collective racial identity surrenders personal agency.A Stoic, in his view, defines themselves by their own character and choices, not by the "accidents" of birth or the narratives of a group.

### 2\. The "Gap" (Emotional Regulation)

Bowen frequently describes his practice as the effort to **"increase the duration between my emotional reaction and my considered rational action."**

- **Data-Driven Detachment:** As a data engineer, he approaches life with a systems mindset.He views emotions as "signals" that must be processed and verified before being acted upon.
- **Anti-Fragility:** Influenced by Nassim Taleb, he views Stoicism as a way to become "antifragile"—getting stronger through stress and chaos rather than breaking.
- **Rejection of Outrage:** He uses Stoicism to insulate himself from the "outrage industrial complex" of modern media. He often critiques "magical thinking" in politics, preferring a cold, rational assessment of what is actually within one's control (the "Dichotomy of Control").

### 3\. Cosmopolitanism & The "Open Society"

Drawing on the Stoic concept of *Kosmopolitês* (citizen of the world), Bowen advocates for a universalist worldview that transcends tribalism.

- **Civil Libertarianism:** He connects Stoic ethics to his political views, specifically the "Lockean view of government." He believes in the rule of law and the protection of individual rights as the political manifestation of reason.
- **Humor as Virtue:** Unlike the stereotype of the joyless Stoic, Bowen emphasizes **humor** as a necessary virtue for resilience. He views the ability to laugh at the absurdity of the world as a sign of a healthy, detached mind.

### Key Writings on This Topic

He explores these themes primarily in his newsletter **"Stoic Observations"** (on Substack) and in his contributions to **Free Black Thought**. Notable essays and themes include:

- **"The Axis of Magic":** Contrasting rational Stoic action with political "magical thinking."
- **"Arguing With Socrates":** The importance of constant self-inquiry and challenging one's own assumptions.
- **"Scale and Memory":** A reflection on human limitations versus machine precision, advocating for a lifestyle that respects "human scale."

In short, his Stoicism is a tool for **intellectual sovereignty** —a way to remain a "free thinker" who is not enslaved by political dogmas or emotional reactivity.

**Would you like to know how he specifically applies this philosophy to his critiques of modern "DEI" (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives?**

---

Yes show me that.

---

Michael David Cobb Bowen approaches the critique of modern DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives not just as a cultural commentator, but as a **data engineer** and **Stoic**.

He views many modern DEI practices as intellectually lazy, emotionally manipulative, and often counter-productive because they rely on what he calls "magical thinking" rather than empirical reality or individual agency.

### 1\. "Disable the Racial" vs. Anti-Racism

Bowen argues that modern DEI initiatives (often framed as "anti-racist") ironically perpetuate the very thing they claim to fight: racial essentialism.

- **The Critique:** He believes that "anti-racism" as practiced today still operates *within* the framework of race, keeping racial categories alive and central to human identity.
- **The Solution:** He advocates for **"Disabling the Racial."** This means actively withdrawing one's assent (a Stoic concept) from racial categories entirely. He argues that race has no "legal standing" in a rational mind and that one should be "anti-race," not just "anti-racist."
- **On Affinity Groups:** He generally rejects any form of collective racial identification, arguing that relying on "blackness" (or any racial group) for identity or political power is a surrender of personal agency.

### 2\. The Critique of "Equity"

Bowen has specifically critiqued the concept of "equity" (equality of outcome) as a dangerous psychological crutch.

- **Reinforcing Inferiority:** He argues that equity initiatives often rely on the premise that Black people cannot succeed without special intervention. He views this as a form of "internalized Black inferiority" that complements "White supremacy."
- **Role Enforcement:** He states that the "cure" of equity "reinforces and enables racial roles," suggesting that there is something unique for each race to do, rather than viewing individuals as distinct agents.

### 3\. "The Axis of Magic" vs. Data Rigor

As a professional data architect, Bowen critiques the lack of rigor in DEI metrics.

- **Magical Thinking:** He refers to the "Axis of Magic" in politics and culture—the belief that using the right words or performing the right rituals (like diversity statements) will essentially alter reality. He contrasts this with the **"OODA Loop"** (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act), preferring cold, hard data over emotional narratives.
- **The "Six Pounds of Racism":** He introduced this concept to critique the "one drop rule" of modern racism accusations. He argues that in the current DEI climate, "everything is racist," which destroys the ability to measure the *actual* weight and force of specific racist acts. He advocates for a "physics of racism" where we distinguish between trivial slights and actual oppression, rather than treating them all as maximum-impact events.

### 4\. Stoic Resilience Over Fragility

He believes modern DEI training often fosters "fragility" rather than resilience.

- **Internal Locus of Control:** A core Stoic tenet is focusing only on what is in your control. Bowen argues that DEI focuses almost entirely on *externals* (what other people think, say, or do), which leaves individuals in a perpetual state of victimhood and anxiety.
- **Humor as a Defense:** He frequently uses humor to deflate the self-seriousness of "woke" culture, viewing the ability to laugh at racial absurdity as a sign of mental health and freedom.

### Video: "In Defense of Free Black Thought"

This video features Michael David Cobb Bowen alongside Jake Mackey, discussing the principles behind their organization, **Free Black Thought**. It is highly relevant as they discuss the necessity of viewpoint diversity within the Black community, directly challenging the monolithic narratives often found in standard DEI training.
