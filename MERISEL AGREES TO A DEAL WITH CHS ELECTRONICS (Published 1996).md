Merisel Inc. agreed yesterday to sell most of its European operations and all of its Latin American businesses to CHS Electronics Inc. for $130 million in cash and the assumption of $30 million of debt. Merisel, a money-losing computer and software distributor, hired Merrill Lynch & Company in April to help it explore selling all or part of the company. The transaction will make Miami-based CHS Electronics the second-largest computer- and software-products distributor in Western Europe and give it a substantial presence in Mexico. The businesses being sold generated about $1.5 billion of Merisel's $4.6 billion of revenue last year. Merisel's stock rose 50 cents, to $2.9375, in Nasdaq trading. CHS's shares climbed 56.26 cents, to $12.1875.
