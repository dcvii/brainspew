Tech executive Adam Miller, 56, is running for Los Angeles mayor. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)

A tech executive who made a fortune developing education software, then waded into the [fight against homelessness,](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-20/a-tech-billionaire-vows-make-homeless-housing-affordable-and-profitable) is now entering the race for Los Angeles mayor.

Adam Miller, co-founder of [Better Angels](https://www.betterangels.la/), a nonprofit focused on preventing homelessness and building affordable housing, filed paperwork on Wednesday to run against Mayor Karen Bass in the June 2 primary election.

Miller, in an interview, said the city is on a downward trajectory and is beset with problems. He said it needs someone with strong leadership skills at City Hall.

"A lot of the issues we face in the city are management problems, and I know how to manage," he said. "I've managed effectively teams that are big and small. I've managed teams that are domestic and international. And I've managed programs at every stage, so I know how to scale things up and make them operate at scale for a big system."

The 56-year-old entrepreneur and nonprofit executive is making his move at a moment when the candidate lineup remains unsettled. Even with Saturday's deadline for filing candidate paperwork fast approaching, some are still undecided on whether to run.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath has spent several days hinting that she may jump into the race, while also taking shots at Bass on CNN and elsewhere.

Maryam Zar, who founded the Palisades Recovery Coalition in the wake of the Palisades fire, is also weighing a run. Even real estate developer Rick Caruso, who publicly ruled out a mayoral bid last month, [told KNX](https://x.com/knxnews/status/2019226735963742440) on Wednesday that he may reconsider.

Former L.A. schools Supt. Austin Beutner, who launched his campaign in October, ended his bid for mayor on Thursday, citing the [death of his 22-year-old daughter](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-30/austin-beutners-daughter-found-beside-highway-in-palmdale-night-she-died) on Jan. 6. Reality TV star Spencer Pratt has spent the last several weeks [promoting his book](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2026-01-27/spencer-pratt-memoir-karen-bass-mayor-race-2026) "The Guy You Loved to Hate," and emerged earlier this week to file his candidate paperwork.

Community organizer Rae Huang has been courting the city's left-leaning voters, appearing with podcaster Hasan Piker in a conversation about [housing policy](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gO4vtsknl-c).

Meanwhile, Bass has been using the trappings of her office to promote her work, scheduling [two State of the City speeches](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/bass-will-give-two-state-of-city-speeches-during-election-season) in a three-month span. The [first of those](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-02-02/bass-preaches-unity-in-los-angeles-ahead-of-2028-olympics), delivered Monday, sounded in many ways like a campaign stump speech, except longer.

After Miller filed his paperwork, Bass spokesperson Douglas Herman immediately derided him as a "wealthy venture capitalist" who sold software that helped large companies "systematically lay off workers."

"The last thing Los Angeles needs now is another self-funder who doesn’t understand the crisis of affordability in our city," Herman said. "Mayor Karen Bass will continue working to solve the biggest problems facing our city with groundbreaking efforts on housing affordability, reductions in street homelessness and public safety stats sitting at 60-year lows.”

Miller pushed back on the mayor's statement, saying his company's software was used for training and helping employees build their skills. He said that, although he will provide a loan to his campaign to get things started, he will be raising money like any other candidate.

Miller is the former chief executive of [Cornerstone OnDemand](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-cornerstone-learning-la-tech-20170606-htmlstory.html), the global training and development company that he built over more than two decades, growing it to more than 3,000 employees. The publicly traded company was sold in 2021 to a private equity firm for $5.2 billion, he said.

The Brentwood resident has been heavily focused on philanthropy, serving as chair of the nonprofit 1P.org, which is a charitable foundation that provides funding to other nonprofit groups.

Miller said he and his wife, Staci, while mapping out their philanthropic work, chose to focus on intractable problems at the local, state, national and global level. Locally, he said, homelessness was the issue they identified as the most intractable.

1P.org has been providing funding to Better Angels, which has been working to build affordable housing while also distributing microloans to families facing eviction. In addition, the nonprofit has developed an app to help homeless outreach workers stay connected.

Sara Reyes, executive director of SELAH Neighborhood Homeless Coalition, said its 700 volunteers use Better Angels' outreach app to maintain relationships with one another and their clients in neighborhoods stretching from Hollywood to Atwater Village.

The app is not integrated with the homeless database maintained by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, a city-county partnership, and would be more effective if it was, Reyes said.

Miller said the city needs help with issues that go well beyond homelessness. For example, he said, city leaders have made L.A. “one of the least developer-friendly cities in the country,” hindering the construction of new homes.

"We have a major housing shortage," he said. "We have an unacceptable number of people who are unhoused. We have affordability issues. I'd say city cleanliness is on the decline. We are not well prepared for disasters, as was clearly seen last year."
