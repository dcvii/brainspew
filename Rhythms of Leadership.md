Last year I taught a leadership course to a group of non-profit executives. My emphasis in the course centered on John Boyd's _**["appreciation and leadership" versus "command and control."](https://slightlyeastofnew.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/organic_design5.pdf)**_ Of course we discussed the OODA "loop" sketch and other Boyd ideas around strategy. It was a great class and we had a great time.

One of my students, Stephanie Matthews, is the executive director for _**["A Tribe for Jazz."](https://www.atribeforjazz.org/)**_ This organization's mission is "to advance the future of Jazz for generations by producing content, events and activities that transform, educate and lead to purposeful actions and impactful conversations surrounding the preservation of the genre." With Stephanie's insights on jazz, we were able to use this beloved musical genre as a backdrop for learning and applying Boyd's theories. There are a lot of similarities between jazz as an art form and Boyd's theories.

Jazz is an art form that embodies dynamic creativity, improvisation, and adaptability. These characteristics are like the concepts taught by Boyd. He emphasized adaptability, decentralization, and continuous innovation. These have a beautiful overlap with the essence of jazz. Let's explore the parallels between jazz and Boyd’s theories. We will highlight how certain characteristics of jazz reflect Boyd’s ideas.

**Improvisation**

At the heart of jazz is improvisation, the spontaneous creation of music in real-time. This core element of jazz mirrors Boyd’s emphasis on adaptability and improvisation. In both contexts, individuals must understand and respond to situations that always change. Jazz musicians adapt to new melodies, rhythms, and harmonies. They show fluidity and flexibility. Likewise, Boyd advocates for agility in thought and action. This enables individuals and organizations to adjust to unfolding circumstances with deliberate speed. The ability to improvise helps jazz musicians and strategists stay ahead of their audiences or competitors. They maintaining an edge through this dynamic, ongoing process.

**Decentralized**

Boyd emphasized a decentralized approach to leadership. This allows units to operate independently while adhering to the intent of a larger strategy. This concept is beautifully illustrated in jazz. Each musician has the autonomy to express themselves within the framework of the collective performance. The decentralized execution in jazz aligns with Boyd’s idea, as local actors make decisions that contribute to the strategic goal. This decentralized approach enhances creativity, anticipatory power and responsiveness. The collective performance remains in tune while individual talent can shine through.

**Harmony and Dissonance**

In jazz, the interplay of harmony and dissonance creates a dynamic and engaging musical experience. This is like Boyd’s theories on maneuver warfare, which highlight the importance of harmony and disruption. By establishing harmony, jazz musicians set a baseline that listeners can follow. On the other hand, dissonance introduces elements of surprise and tension. Similarly, Boyd advocated creating and exploiting dissonance to disorient opponents and create opportunities. Harmony would keep the unit together, focused and directed on a goal. This use of harmony and disruption in both jazz and conflict shows the importance of balancing stability with innovation. This is another way we can achieve continued success.

**Rhythmic Complexity**

Jazz often features complex rhythms that require precise timing and coordination. This emphasis on rhythmic complexity resonates with Boyd’s focus on tempo and timing within the OODA loop. Controlling the tempo of operations is crucial in disrupting a competitor's decision-making process. In jazz, the intricate rhythms challenge musicians to harmonize their efforts. This is much like how strategists must align their actions to maintain the initiative. The mastery of rhythm in jazz exemplifies the strategic importance of timing and coordination to gain an advantage.

**Innovation and Creativity**

Continuous innovation is a prime characteristic of both jazz and Boyd’s strategic theories. Jazz thrives on the relentless pursuit of new sounds and styles, pushing the boundaries of creativity. This commitment to innovation mirrors Boyd’s emphasis on the need for continuous improvement and adaptation to maintain a competitive edge. With continuous innovation, jazz musicians and strategists alike ensure they remain ahead of their competitors. They do this by transforming volatility and uncertainty into opportunities for growth and success.

**Interaction and Feedback**

In jazz, musicians engage in constant interaction and feedback. They adjust their play based on the input from others in the group. This dynamic interplay can be illustrated in the OODA "loop" sketch. The orientation of each musician shapes their observations, decisions and actions as they play. The iterative nature of jazz shown in the OODA "loop" sketch highlights how musicians improvise individually and as a group. By incorporating feedback, musicians and strategists enhance their performance. They refine their approach to achieve better results.

**Fluidity and Flexibility**

Fluidity and flexibility are essential in both jazz and Boyd’s strategic thinking. Jazz musicians must be able to shift their play to match the evolving music. They must continue to adapt to changing circumstances. Boyd’s emphasis on fluidity in conflict underscores the importance of being able to move and adjust with speed. By embracing fluidity and flexibility, both jazz musicians and strategists can navigate constant complexity. They can turn challenges into opportunities.

**Unpredictability**

Jazz often includes unexpected changes and spontaneous improvisations. This can both surprise and engage the audience. This unpredictability aligns with Boyd’s discussing how surprise disrupts and confuses adversaries. By introducing elements of unpredictability, jazz musicians and strategists can create mismatches. This keeps their audience or opponents off balance. Unpredictability highlights the value of surprise in achieving a competitive advantage.

**Learning and Growth**

Continuous learning and growth are fundamental to both jazz and Boyd’s theories. Jazz musicians always evolve, incorporating new techniques and ideas into their play. Constant practice and learning mirrors Boyd’s emphasis on the need to reorient. By continuously learning and adapting, both musicians and strategists can enhance their capabilities. This ensures that they remain effective and innovative in their respective fields.

Jazz resonates deeply with John Boyd’s theories on strategy and decision-making. Improvisation, decentralized control, harmony and dissonance, rhythmic complexity, innovation and creativity, interaction and feedback, fluidity and flexibility, unpredictability, and commitment to learning and growth in jazz all reflect key aspects of Boyd’s strategic ideas. By exploring these parallels, it becomes evident that the dynamic nature of jazz embodies the concepts Boyd taught. The enduring relevance of his theories empower both art and strategy.

Thank you so much Stephanie for helping me learn to teach Boyd and his ideas through the beautiful lens of jazz!
