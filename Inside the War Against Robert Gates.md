**When Bob Gates took over** as Secretary of Defense at the end of 2006, he stated unequivocally that one of his primary goals would be to improve America's ability to perform in post-war environments — to better fight an insurgency, really. Cognizant that our military might in conventional, big-war capabilities was driving all of our real-time opponents toward pronouncedly asymmetrical, small-wars strategies, Gates decided to end — finally, stemming from the days well before Donald Rumsfeld — the Defense Department's institutional bias against preparing for such "low-intensity" scenarios. Low intensity, he understands, has become the all-too-intense norm of modern warfare.

When it came to selling that paradigm shift, Gates didn't need to convince the military itself — the ascendant Army and Marine corps have suffered enough casualties to have learned it the hard way. And quite honestly, Gates needn't worry about the defense industry's willingness to follow the money, because Lockheed Martin and L-3 have been snatching up enough blue-chip companies to prove they can spot the Pentagon's future funding spigots.

Turns out you can find Gates's biggest antagonists in the halls of Congress, where the battle cry of "Jobs, jobs, jobs!" echoes the military's growing embrace of funding for the manpower that'll keep this counter-insurgency movement as successful as it's become. So even amidst all this fighting and dying — neither of which is likely to slow down any time soon — the American military's newest struggle seems to come down to one question: whose economic stabilization package matters more?

In other words, is the Pentagon really in the business of making this world a safer place for America and its citizens? Or is it just some freewheeling job-creation scheme sponsored by the federal government and ignorant of the world's trends in global security?

## Bludgeoning the Budget with a Google Search

**Don't get me wrong:** I love owning the world's biggest gun. But when our ability to possess that gun depends — to a stunning degree — on the rest of the world's willingness to finance its construction and use, then America cannot appear unresponsive to a changing global market for our Leviathan services. In past decades, it was enough to deter larger prospective warriors like the USSR; today America is back in the business of settling globalization's many untamed frontiers, whether we like it or not.

Gates understands this nuance of modern warfare, too. So he wants to create a home for today's warfighters — the *Dances with Wolves* guys who get stuck manning those tiny forts in southern Afghanistan. He wants the Pentagon to stop looking down upon them, to stop haphazardly welding so-called "hillbilly" armor onto vehicles that lacked such basic protection. He wants America to stop casually trading their lives in the here-and-now fight against real insurgencies for theoretical casualties in dreamed-up, there-and-then fights against, I dunno, the Chinese or something. He wants, ultimately, to show them the money.

In response to his "radical" vision, Gates is preparing for the Know Nothings — those same national-security figureheads who have long sung his praises from the Capitol — to put him through the meat grinder. He will be dubbed, with all appropriate indirectness, "naïve" and "reckless." His opponents, all of whom fear that the loss of home-district defense jobs will ultimately end their congressional careers, will suddenly accuse Gates of disregarding this or that "disturbing trend." Try not to laugh out loud when you spot these security neophytes on TV, spouting absolute nonsense fed to them by staffers smarted-up by Google searches.

Most pointedly, Gates will be rhetorically indicted for putting "America's sons and daughters at risk" — not today's version, mind you, but some mythical future cohort of starship troopers armed with over-engineered combat systems that we can't possibly afford to buy, much less maintain.

A favorite recent example: Georgian senator Saxby Chambliss [declaring to the *Wall Street Journal*](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123915109390799449.html) that it would be shortsighted to think "we're going to be fighting terrorists for 50 years and we're not going to be engaged in a conventional war." Let me deconstruct that statement a bit, because it's a loaded one: "Conventional war" here is code for a major war against another great power, not the kind of overmatch situations against regional rogues that we've encountered these past couple decades — much less the concentrated counter-insurgency operations since 9/11, in which terrorists typically *are* problem No. 1 (thus the already frequent accusation that Gates is "fighting the last war").

America hasn't fought a war against another great power since 1945, coincidentally the year we obtained and first used nuclear weapons. Since then, no two great powers armed with nukes have *ever* gone to war — one of the longest droughts since nation-states were invented. Since the Cold War, meanwhile, our global-security environment has witnessed a serious ratcheting-up of transnational terrorism, failed states, internal strife, and all the accompanying interventions by outside great powers and international organizations.

Frankly, given the profound financial interdependence among the world's great powers today, the prospects for great-power war — conventional or otherwise — are arguably dimmer than they've ever been in modern history. Layer on additional environmental interdependencies generated by climate change, and the case against America being drawn into great-power war over the next fifty years seems all the stronger.

## Accepting the Realities of Terrorism (Pirates Included)

**In contrast,** it would take an idealist of John Lennon's lyrical stature to predict a future in which terrorism — in all its low-tech and emerging high-tech forms — *isn't* the predominant mode of conflict in a world undergoing twin paradigm shifts of its own: a religious "great awakening" (*Imagine plenty more religion...*) and the rise of history's first truly global middle class of consumers (*...and more possessions, too*!). So while I'm not given to surrendering the future to John Robb's "global guerillas" any time soon, I'm hard-pressed to locate a more gritty and realistic appraisal of the enemies America will persistently face in coming decades — as in, plenty *to kill or die for*.

So yeah, Senator Chambliss, I *don't* think it's shortsighted to view the world in this manner — anything but.

And neither does Gates, who offers a sensible breakdown of his budget proposal as being 10 percent small wars-centric, 50 percent large wars-centric, and 40 percent dual-use. As bureaucratic tipping points go, this mix strikes me as supremely sensible — even conservative.

But make no mistake: Gates's budget preview arrived last week like a shot across the bow of the big-war camp. He came down — quite explicitly — on the side of the small-wars Army and Marines, stating he would no longer tolerate big-war demands for ruinously expensive ships from the Navy and aircraft from the Air Force. Future scenarios, Gates warned, cannot include analytical wedges that assume our great-power opponents possess unlimited resources and time — much less unlimited technology.

Case in point: All of this bureaucratic reorganizing at the Pentagon coincided with our Navy's slow-motion (but ultimately elegant) [rescuing of a ship from Somali pirates](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a5805/somali-pirate-attack-rescues-040909/). Eventually, we sent in a destroyer with enough firepower to lay waste to everything of value in Somalia, and yet the endgame consisted of SEAL snipers dispatching of three teenagers who arguably never had a chance for any better outcome in life.

At the end of the day, then, our government needs to ask itself if the new defense budget moves America closer to or further away from the world as we find it evolving. As somebody who's argued for many years about "downshifting" the Pentagon's strategic perspective — and resources — from large conflicts to small ("system administration," as I like to call it), Gates turns out to be the seminal figure I hoped he would become. Assuming his continued success, he arguably goes down as President Obama's most influential first-term cabinet pick.

Why? This Gates-led rebalancing constitutes only the second such momentous shift in American history. Prior to World War I, our military was configured primarily for small wars — namely, the Indian wars of our westward expansion. Since World War II, American forces have been used overwhelmingly in small-war situations, even as our budgetary bias toward the big-war force remained unchallengeable. Until now, that is.

Viewed in that historical light, Gates is simply leading us toward a back-to-the-future solution for today's global-security environment. Hardly an abandonment of our role as global Leviathan, rather, it is a *restoration* of a familiar tool kit for the integration of seemingly untamable frontiers. Fortunately for us, there are numerous rising great powers that are similarly incentivized.
