üßµTHREAD: The Man Who Lived Among Extraterrestrials at Nellis AFB (1965‚Äì1967)  
  
Charles James Hall was a weather observer for the U.S. Air Force. He claims he wasn't just tracking balloons.  
  
He was stationed at the base where the Tall White aliens lived, and they had rules.üëá <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941930715689504768/pl/2gGYXxj0NyifGHep.m3u8?v=215&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941930715689504768/vid/avc1/384x270/EeYoEMK8aOfbpI95.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941930715689504768/vid/avc1/512x360/8OqQEH19TfewDQ2L.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941930715689504768/vid/avc1/864x606/xe-66eDv_xl-gFEe.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

1/  
  
Hall was deployed to Nellis AFB in March 1965. By 1966, he was hand-picked by a joint alien, U.S. military committee to serve as the only weather observer allowed on certain ranges.  
  
He had access to Area 53, Area 54, and a base known only as Dreamland. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941931442734268416/pl/7Juy7NQqzjVuIodI.m3u8?v=a93&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941931442734268416/vid/avc1/386x270/yh6IlgUzuDUSWw7O.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941931442734268416/vid/avc1/514x360/avrreFL0EeWk8PST.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941931442734268416/vid/avc1/864x604/jKy7IiNwglPhZD7v.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

2/  
  
He says Dreamland is not just a code name. It was a literal area where Tall White extraterrestrials had an underground embassy.  
  
They lived in a mountain on the western side of the valley. Their base was ‚Äútreated like a foreign nation.‚Äù <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941932224313434112/pl/qoI2TOdy-yxL6AEp.m3u8?v=a44&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941932224313434112/vid/avc1/382x270/yD4QwP-0_D7YquMs.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941932224313434112/vid/avc1/508x360/HWm6qYj7qpqjm6uE.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941932224313434112/vid/avc1/864x610/UzGrX8Rfoy1TQCP8.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

3/  
  
These Tall Whites had spacecraft arriving on a fixed lunar schedule. They were gravity-propelled, FTL-capable, and had to be recharged like batteries.  
  
They came and went at full moons and new moons. Two-week cycles. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941934109191737344/pl/OSZwIruubgMLJP0z.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941934109191737344/vid/avc1/384x270/9WvpCgx1f1EkfiLd.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941934109191737344/vid/avc1/514x360/DbSrnrtjWyZIeV3B.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941934109191737344/vid/avc1/860x602/eeVfXXNr9O3-V6dJ.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Their craft were built here on Earth.  
  
Hall claims many scout craft were manufactured using Lockheed, Boeing, and Airstream parts. Seats still had mold stamps. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941936268788506624/pl/v37aJFzh-HplS1tM.m3u8?v=68a&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941936268788506624/vid/avc1/384x270/_Ly2V7wQCqlv6IeR.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941936268788506624/vid/avc1/512x360/NBShU2hopCK0KNGp.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941936268788506624/vid/avc1/864x606/jx-TZCALFypJrcJ2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

5/  
  
Hall also describes the propulsion system in detail, fiber-optic coils, subatomic particle streams, and temperature sensitive drives.  
  
He dubbed his theory Hall Photon Theory and published it in Millennial Hospitality 3. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941936869136064512/pl/LRFljoRBCXok9ps8.m3u8?v=9e8&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941936869136064512/vid/avc1/382x270/TPEIl-sd-pj5v7ZL.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941936869136064512/vid/avc1/510x360/G915IYY_mwf8kF9M.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941936869136064512/vid/avc1/860x606/lgOhQU3OcFZtFgC5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

6/  
  
The aliens he encountered were humanoid but visibly different.  
  
They were white as paper with blue eyes, that turn pink with age, and thin, translucent hair.  
  
With frail bodies, some as tall as 8+ feet in old age. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941937696005365760/pl/1CcJC5AQwxgHecDi.m3u8?v=7ad&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941937696005365760/vid/avc1/380x270/fiiwLfrEyqrmw4Lp.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941937696005365760/vid/avc1/508x360/hg3IAsQLwVnTD_Gp.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941937696005365760/vid/avc1/864x612/j0ZXcaR_EI98jtta.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

7/  
  
Hall says they had weapons that used targeted microwave-like emissions. Settings included:  
  
Sodium: extreme pain or death  
  
Calcium: paralysis or calming  
  
Iodine: internal bleeding  
  
Hypnosis: missing time via direct shot to the temple <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941938977675603968/pl/tNr9jpRupuMqYbvV.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941938977675603968/vid/avc1/378x270/e3w9bqfVGaq-esxB.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941938977675603968/vid/avc1/506x360/TkgJOItq8QffReBf.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941938977675603968/vid/avc1/830x590/2ivc0V_6c-7MBS7e.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

8/  
  
Most of the time, they came in family units. Children played near his weather shack. Mothers would ask if it was okay for them to observe his weather balloons.  
  
The aliens were especially protective of their kids, touching one was suicide. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941939811620675585/pl/tFZY0ANDqjXXgVpq.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941939811620675585/vid/avc1/382x270/P3Hm0Eq5vvqa4nzU.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941939811620675585/vid/avc1/510x360/HzsOo05G7jrKR_fC.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941939811620675585/vid/avc1/836x590/sbOBV7YcsWcZnog5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

9/  
  
They weren‚Äôt cold beings, they had personalities.  
  
Some were friendly, curious, and others were military types, stern, and terrifying, like ‚ÄúThe General.‚Äù  
  
Hall says one female alien proudly wore a nurse outfit from Sears. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941941252498296832/pl/BdCW9ngbnSGBGyiS.m3u8?v=bce&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941941252498296832/vid/avc1/426x270/HTxKDtf6NqBixFJ1.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941941252498296832/vid/avc1/568x360/-ejyMBxgNEgA7v09.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941941252498296832/vid/avc1/844x534/ct-ucv2FC_6K2pPb.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

10/  
  
They had a dry sense of humor. They liked catalogs. And they hated Air Force fashion sense.  
  
Some even wanted to visit Las Vegas to shop according to Hall! <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941942034283036672/pl/Xn6-CNyy_gI34PYj.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941942034283036672/vid/avc1/380x270/7u9x66vkQC7GUxF8.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941942034283036672/vid/avc1/506x360/FPcIVOOrZTywc2gJ.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941942034283036672/vid/avc1/834x592/XSEf8gIiEXoQT4xA.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

11/  
  
Technology exchange was limited and on their terms.  
  
They didn‚Äôt give up FTL secrets. But they cooperated on communication tech, especially radios, if it helped them get repairs. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941942442103562240/pl/LFMrI4KZ_YfUN0Pz.m3u8?v=1f8&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941942442103562240/vid/avc1/384x270/rJTg32wg1jD2PlZt.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941942442103562240/vid/avc1/512x360/mR4gB805qOVu9Png.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941942442103562240/vid/avc1/834x586/5EzufsuYLmFWCW0m.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

12/  
Hall says the aliens used him as a ‚Äútest human‚Äù to help new Tall White arrivals get comfortable interacting with people.  
  
He‚Äôd be visited, examined, and shown off like a zoo exhibit, but treated with formal respect. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941943131831685120/pl/7xs-6R8COd1FCgcX.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941943131831685120/vid/avc1/380x270/RP74edzcuu_JEg1m.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941943131831685120/vid/avc1/508x360/4RQd2Sbi8rcS8rN2.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941943131831685120/vid/avc1/834x590/pTb7crzXVuk4O16I.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

13/  
  
They also monitored his emotional state.  
  
Hall describes being hypnotized mid-step while walking between his balloon and shack. He‚Äôd experience 20 minutes of missing time and only recall 2 seconds.  
  
They never briefed him, and no one debriefed him. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941943828170055680/pl/dcRKUe2tFZNjKQ8Z.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941943828170055680/vid/avc1/380x270/WddhKoBqs2xruA_e.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941943828170055680/vid/avc1/508x360/ahVnginav6RyJ09j.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941943828170055680/vid/avc1/834x590/QFF5SozAxALLA9PI.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

14/  
  
The orders from the Pentagon said it all, according to Hall, he was told:  
  
‚ÄúNothing you do is classified. You may speak freely. No one may interrogate you.‚Äù <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941944515540987905/pl/5ryS2iAQpHK3eWlo.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941944515540987905/vid/avc1/382x270/Um47Cr0ZEUlR0cFs.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941944515540987905/vid/avc1/508x360/b1k9NFtM6qIvi5bk.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941944515540987905/vid/avc1/830x586/Hy4pZsODvLKWZd7b.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

15/  
  
Hall believes the Tall Whites live up to 700 years, and their social structure mirrors ours with engineers, medics, civilians, even comedians.  
  
He says one night he witnessed up to 300 Tall Whites and 75 scout craft parked in formation. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941945079939145728/pl/riRBmV-Y3IpOrFGL.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941945079939145728/vid/avc1/380x270/k9DzU2kZvGVxYkEe.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941945079939145728/vid/avc1/508x360/EQgaUsPnpywnA6Lu.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941945079939145728/vid/avc1/834x590/BjP7FXEBsKQ190o8.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

16/  
  
He never saw them travel through time or to other dimensions, but he did see craft silently defeat gravity and land on dust without a sound.  
  
The aliens didn‚Äôt come to enlighten us, they came to do business. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941946836832411648/pl/Wwcdyj1Bu76zueYy.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941946836832411648/vid/avc1/380x270/XAuk5N28J6qrN-fy.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941946836832411648/vid/avc1/506x360/0CTX8JMFx2vcOtIj.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941946836832411648/vid/avc1/832x590/GOMZcUekJYsIZagC.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

17/  
  
They lived by their agreements and expected us to do the same, word for word, like Philadelphia lawyers.  
  
In return, they shared what they needed to share‚Ä¶ and nothing more. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941947259077201920/pl/e4_WG_f-d6q_bk3o.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941947259077201920/vid/avc1/382x270/wNJ3tkdHYvJUd1_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941947259077201920/vid/avc1/510x360/HOv5xCxnbfr4-Kej.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941947259077201920/vid/avc1/832x586/LfyNedmIEqQWETB3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Charles James Hall still stands by his account.  
  
He names names, dates, units, craft layouts and so much more.  
He says:  
  
‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt angels, they‚Äôre not demons. They‚Äôre just people, strange ones.‚Äù <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941947732849041408/pl/Za2f38qWGp8bAwV_.m3u8?container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941947732849041408/vid/avc1/380x270/VgQrVvaXJromqepd.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941947732849041408/vid/avc1/508x360/okVhxlTBT9xkbs_Q.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941947732849041408/vid/avc1/834x590/bxau99dwXiRM9uIc.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

What‚Äôs more likely:  
  
That a lonely weather observer made up 300 pages of exacting technical and social alien interactions?  
  
Or that we‚Äôve been hosting guests in the Nevada desert for half a century?  
  
You decide.

üßµ David Adair: The Teenage Rocket Scientist Who Touched an Alien Engine at Area 51  
  
What if I told you the U.S. military had a symbiotic fusion engine, not built by humans, and they brought in a 17-year-old to figure out how it worked? <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942195101754589184/pl/wv4yHIufPfRQ6qLR.m3u8?v=206&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942195101754589184/vid/avc1/360x270/p7iRhwd02chi8hzZ.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942195101754589184/vid/avc1/480x360/NHEXa_SWkQhJncWg.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942195101754589184/vid/avc1/814x610/5zHK9wFC8blyOiXE.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

In the summer of 1971, David Adair, a teenage prodigy backed by a federal grant, designed a magnetic fusion containment engine.  
  
A propulsion system so advanced, it could reach 8,600+ mph in 4.1 seconds. His rocket launched from White Sands and landed in Nevada.  
  
Not just anywhere.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942196291984928768/pl/ZY6iySLd-lpvKLOD.m3u8?v=ea9&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942196291984928768/vid/avc1/358x270/G_-g8bdLVrcxgZud.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942196291984928768/vid/avc1/478x360/fVFoCZPUuoO94040.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942196291984928768/vid/avc1/812x610/qYXOdtutvUhVzo1j.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

It landed exactly where they told him: Groom Lake.  
  
Better known today as Area 51.  
  
When he arrived, the military didn‚Äôt take him to see his rocket. Instead, they drove him to an underground hangar the size of four football fields.  
  
Then the floor dropped. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942197237880139776/pl/Zqtg-XD-3z0N2Y21.m3u8?v=83a&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942197237880139776/vid/avc1/360x270/TUP8wxmUNSvo9JKT.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942197237880139776/vid/avc1/482x360/SEgOhX_EETJg8_sB.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1942197237880139776/vid/avc1/812x606/i-yyiB9XlI23XpQ7.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

üßµRobert Dean: The NATO Officer Who Read the UFO Report That Changed Everything  
  
Robert Dean wasn‚Äôt a conspiracy theorist.  
He was a senior NATO intelligence analyst with Cosmic Top Secret clearance, the highest you can get.  
In 1964, while stationed at SHAPE headquarters, someone threw a classified report on his desk.  
‚ÄúRead this. It‚Äôll wake you up.‚Äùüëá <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941511764278984706/pl/peKYVCy6M4r_y0Px.m3u8?v=955&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941511764278984706/vid/avc1/480x270/208Pnqv8hMV7RrLL.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941511764278984706/vid/avc1/640x360/J8M0rNAkJkk3NmB9.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941511764278984706/vid/avc1/1080x606/FvBI70n6Co4yudVH.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The report was titled:  
‚ÄúAn Assessment: An Evaluation of a Possible Military Threat to Allied Forces in Europe.‚Äù  
It wasn‚Äôt about the Soviets.  
It was about the UFOs that had been flying over Europe, metallic discs in formation, tracked on radar, observed by military personnel from multiple nations.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941512400085082112/pl/AHsyd6U09rXKpVdq.m3u8?v=db7&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941512400085082112/vid/avc1/482x270/dUBWKwmHw2S14M-E.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941512400085082112/vid/avc1/644x360/YIskPXwx_njdtlPz.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1941512400085082112/vid/avc1/1086x606/0upHIqdfnAPEgL1s.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

3/  
In February 1961, these objects nearly triggered a war.  
  
NATO thought it was Russia.  
Russia thought it was NATO.  
Neither was correct.  
The discs came in from the East, over Germany and France, then disappeared over the Norwegian Sea, moving like clockwork, with intelligence, and no allegiance to Earth.

1/  
McKenna told Jeffrey Mishlove:  
The idea of aliens arriving in nuts-and-bolts ships to trade, invade, or evangelize is just a modern myth.  
One that started after WWII, and it doesn‚Äôt hold up anymore.

2/  
There are too many encounters, too many types of encounters.  
Craft, orbs, abductions, missing time, telepathy, synchronicity, psychic residue.  
It doesn‚Äôt act like a physical investigation.  
  
It behaves like a psychological intervention.

The test was called Bluegill Triple Prime, a classified high-altitude detonation launched from Johnston Island in the Pacific as part of Operation Fishbowl.  
Officially, it was to test the effects of nukes in space.  
  
Unofficially?

In the recovered footage, held for decades by defense contractor EG&G, an object appears to tumble down from the blast zone.  
  
This object doesn‚Äôt behave like a booster stage. It maneuvers.

üßµSomething strange happens the moment you die. And it may be the final clue that consciousness isn‚Äôt in your brain at all‚Ä¶

2/  
This isn‚Äôt just a human glitch.  
  
It was seen in rats a decade ago. Then, in 2023, researchers caught it happening in people, just seconds after they were declared clinically dead.  
  
No heartbeat, or oxygen, and yet, the brain lights up like it‚Äôs having a moment of clarity.

3/  
The spikes appeared in the posterior cortical hot zone, the exact area linked to visual experiences and self-aware perception.  
  
In plain English, the same part of the brain that activates when you dream, recall your past or have an intense psychedelic trip.
