Plastic is everywhere. We all know that. And we’ve all heard about the danger that plastic can pose to our health when specks of it from, say, soda bottles or take-out food containers wind up ingested.

For instance, there was a highly publicized [study of cadaver brains](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness) in February 2025, using a new technique for finding plastic particles in the body, that concluded that in the most extreme cases, plastic shards made up 0.48 percent of the brain—enough to make a plastic spoon. Other studies, using the same technique, came to the same conclusion, leading to lots of shocking headlines and scary quotes from scientists. Matthew Campen, co-author of the plastic spoon study, even implied that plastic lodged in the brain [might cause dementia](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11010-025-05428-3).

Fast-forward to November, when another group of researchers published commentary in the journal *Nature* showing that the technique used to find all this plastic couldn’t distinguish the stuff from ordinary fat molecules. *The Guardian*, which had run some of the most [alarmist headlines](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/06/microscopic-plastics-could-raise-risk-of-stroke-and-heart-attack-study-says) (“Microscopic Plastics Could Raise Risk of Stroke and Heart Attack, Study Says”), suddenly reversed course. Last week, it published [a lengthy article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/13/microplastics-human-body-doubt) slamming the research, with critics calling the original 2025 brain study a “joke.”

While microplastics may not pose the health crisis some hyperventilating scientists and newspaper writers warned of, they are threatening us with an irreversible ecological crisis.

To put this in perspective, the studies now being questioned make up just a small piece of the research on microplastics and their effect on living things that’s gone on for the last two decades. So what’s actually true when it comes to the health effects of plastics? Tiny plastic particles are contaminating lakes, rivers, and oceans. They’re getting eaten by plankton and altering the food chain. They’re infused in the soils where we grow our food, changing growth patterns and microbial communities. The particles are increasing exponentially and they are impossible to clean up.

To put it another way, while they may not pose the health crisis some hyperventilating scientists and newspaper writers warned of, they are threatening us with an irreversible ecological crisis. “The thing is, we are not getting this stuff out,” said ecologist Matthias Rillig of the Free University of Berlin.

The term *microplastics* was [coined in 2004](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1094559) by biologist [Richard Thompson](https://e360.yale.edu/features/richard-thompson-interview) of the University of Plymouth. He’d started noticing plastic grains mixed up in beach sand in the UK. He quickly discovered plastic bits mingled with sand on other beaches around the world, and in water, and inside the bodies of plankton and other marine organisms.

Microplastic is a different kind of problem from industrial chemical pollution, such as the [perfluorooctanoic acid](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html), or PFOA that contaminated local water supplies from a Teflon plant in West Virginia and became the basis for the movie *Dark Water*. There is some similarity: PFOA is part of a class of compounds called PFAS, which, like microplastics, can persist in the environment. PFAS are sometimes called forever chemicals. But plastic is far more pervasive. It’s woven into our lifestyles.

For instance, most of our clothes are essentially plastic, and our favorite synthetic fabrics [leak microplastic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49441-4) every time they go through the wash. Microplastic also comes from car tires, which shed particles as we drive.

There are hundreds of kinds of plastic products that break down into fiber or shards or flakes or other shapes, each with different chemistry. They are highly mobile—moving around the ocean and showing up [in all depths](https://www.nsf.gov/news/researchers-discover-microplastics-all-ocean-depths) —including the bottom of the [Mariana Trench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNH0k4gz1Nk).

The hardest place to accurately measure microplastics is inside the human body. Scientists can feed plants and animals carefully measured doses to see where it goes, and can kill and dissect other organisms. That’s not possible with people, and so it’s only been in the last couple of years that scientists have started trying new ways to measure how much plastic is in our bodies.

One group tried measuring microplastics in [plaques removed from people’s arteries](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822?logout=true). Others used cadavers, taking samples from organs and analyzing them with a technique called pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry—a very indirect method that breaks everything up into fragments that are sorted by mass. Using this technique, scientists measured large amounts of plastic in the heart, liver and the [testes](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/20/microplastics-human-testicles-study-sperm-counts) —or thought they did.

That scary February study attempted to measure microplastics in a small sample of brains. They published the result in the prominent journal *[Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1)*. Many journalists looked into it, [including me](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-20/you-might-have-plastic-in-your-brain-but-not-a-spoon-s-worth?srnd=undefined), partly because I depend on my brain and worry about it more than other organs.

From the start there were skeptics pointing out some obvious red flags. The technique was largely untested, at least for studying plastic in the body. The team hadn’t described the kinds of validation tests needed to ensure they weren’t measuring something other than plastic. And the total mass was extraordinarily high—as if the brains were preferentially sucking up plastic.

Misinformation tends to backfire in the long run, eroding the public trust that’s necessary to tackle serious environmental problems.

Then came the blowback in November when a group of chemists [wrote a commentary](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04045-3) explaining how the technique [couldn’t distinguish](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-12-11/the-real-microplastics-problem-isn-t-in-your-brain) polyethylene from the fat particles that make up a big portion of brain tissue. They weren’t suggesting there was no plastic in our brains—just that scientists need a better way to measure it.

Even though I’d been skeptical about the brain paper, I must admit I was a little concerned about all the times I’d bought sports drinks and then kept the plastic bottle, refilling it for tap water during outdoor activities. Were those bottles contaminating the water with increasing doses of plastic as they were jostled and exposed to sunlight? Maybe, but I was relieved that several experts I interviewed for this story said they do the same thing with Gatorade bottles. They reused the bottles to minimize plastic waste, which they felt was more important than minimizing ingested particles.

One of my fellow bottle reusers, retired industry chemist Mark Jones, has been examining the microplastic problem for years and had become concerned that it was being presented to the public in a misleading way. He’d [written about](https://www.rdworldonline.com/microplastics-are-bad-but-ignoring-science-is-worse/) an often repeated nugget of misinformation: that we swallow enough plastic every week to make up a standard credit card. He traced that back to a model, and pointed out that others who’ve [double-checked](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666911022000247) the math found this was [too high](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c07384) by a factor of a million. His concern isn’t that people will care too much about plastics pollution, but that misinformation tends to backfire in the long run, eroding the public trust that’s necessary to tackle serious environmental problems.

Considering that plastic didn’t exist until the 20th century, we’ve made a lot of it. One [prominent analysis](https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.1700782) showed humanity had already produced about 8,300 million tons as of 2015. Only 9 percent of that is recycled and 12 percent incinerated. The other 79 percent is still with us, either in landfills or in the environment. Plastic in well-engineered landfills can be safe enough, but much of what the world throws out ends up elsewhere.

For now, the question of whether microplastics harm humans is still up in the air. That will continue to be the case until studies can be done with the same rigor and scientific scrutiny as are done now about the environmental harm plastics can cause. The fact is, scientists are just beginning to learn how microplastic behaves in the human body, said Chelsea Rochman, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Toronto who has been studying microplastics since 2008.

Rochman told me that scientists have much more experience measuring plastics in environmental samples and other organisms. She said she’d tried the technique used in the plastic spoon brain scare, and found it unreliable. But in her view we already know enough about the harms of microplastics to warrant taking simple measures to slow the influx.

First on the list is cutting back on the kinds of plastic trash that can strangle or choke wildlife before it becomes microplastic. Scientists often see seals trapped in fishing gear and whales washed up on beaches with 20 plastic bags in their stomach. Another simple fix, she said, would be to equip washing machines with filters to prevent the release of microplastics that get pulled off our synthetic clothes and often end up in sludge that’s dumped on farmland. She’s a fan of reusable plastic bottles for water or sports drinks.

Representatives from dozens of countries are now trying to negotiate a [plastic treaty](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/opinion/plastics-treaty-microplastics-chemicals.html). While there are reports of resistance from industry, treaties can create a level playing field for innovative change. That happened in the 1980s when it became clear that chemicals used in spray cans and air conditioners were destroying the ozone layer. A [global treaty](https://web.archive.org/web/20130602153542/http://ozone.unep.org/new_site/en/montreal_protocol.php) helped solve the problem without our having to sacrifice our air-conditioning.

A global plastics treaty might push the plastics industry to create products that are more easily recycled. International monitoring can make sure countries use the right technology for landfills so that waste can be kept out of the oceans.

All this requires some trust in science, and that gets shaken every time scientists make a shocking discovery that [turns out](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/13/microplastics-human-body-doubt) to be wrong. But science usually gets things right when diverse groups find multiple lines of evidence pointing in the same direction. Microplastics really are everywhere and they really are impossible to clean up, so it’s worth slowing down their growth even if they aren’t building up in spectacular quantities in our brains. If that ever did occur, we’d never be able to think our way out of this.
