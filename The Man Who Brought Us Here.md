### How Joe Biden's pride, insularity, and stubbornness led us into this nightmare.

By April of last year, the health of the president had clearly declined. As with many older men in their eighties, this didn’t happen in a slow, predictable glide-path down — but in swift, turbulent declines. Suddenly he took a while to get out of his limo, and then would emerge “with a blank look in his face,” according to the new campaign book, *[Fight](https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Inside-Wildest-Battle-White/dp/006343864X)*, by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. By early summer, Biden was suddenly freezing up in public, staring motionless into the air. At a fundraiser in Los Angeles, Obama had to jump in to answer some questions, and then had to guide Biden off the stage by hand. We had already seen Joe [wander weirdly](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/its-time-for-biden-to-leave-the-stage-cdb) off the set of MSNBC and during a Medal of Honor ceremony. His [memory lapses](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-ruth-bader-ginsburg-syndrome-37a) mounted.

Everyone around him saw this. Everyone close to him had seen it for over a year by then. Everyone in his campaign knew that [upwards of 86 percent](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-americans-on-biden-age/story?id=107126589) of Americans thought he was too old to serve another term. And *no one did anything about it.*

Sometimes human folly is just human folly. Sometimes, even at the pinnacle of the world, you find flawed people struggling with familiar human problems, like how to tell a beloved but fast-aging man that he needs to leave the stage before he falls off it. Just because she was First Lady did not prevent Jill Biden from putting family before country; and just because he was president didn’t mean that Biden reacted to his own decline with denial, anger, pig-headedness, and arrogance.

Do we learn anything new in this book and another one, *Uncharted*, by Chris Whipple out next week? Not really. We know, in fact, that everything I guessed happened did actually happen. Among the unsurprising confirmations: Obama was so aloof he didn’t even watch the fateful June debate live; he and Pelosi then wanted an open primary and did all they could to get one. (“He goes. She goes” was their mantra.) Hillary Clinton defended Biden — not because she knew his health was fine, but because her health had once been questioned by the press too. Biden’s closest advisers were his wife and, yes, his son Hunter, and they routinely put their clan’s interests well before the country’s. His inner circle — Mike Donilon especially — were so blindly loyal and informationally siloed they couldn’t absorb what was staring them in the face.

The Democrats, even as late as July, could have found a fresh candidate capable of taking on what they said was a vital moment for democracy’s survival. We might have avoided our current abyss:

> “It would have been very cheap. It would have been quick. A rocket ship for your career and no loss,” said one Democratic former governor. “If this had been a year earlier, twenty people would have gotten in,” said one governor who had kicked the tires on a 2024 bid.

Why didn’t they? That is a question that will reverberate through history. Wokeness was a factor. The only reason the embarrassingly mid Harris was made veep in the first place was to fill a slot Biden had already marked for a woman, and, in the wake of the Floyd murder, a black woman seemed the only option. Everyone, particularly Pelosi and Obama, knew Harris was a disaster about to happen, and her vice-presidency had the lowest approval ratings in history. Obama told friends directly that he thought she couldn’t win. The night after the epic debate, Pelosi gritted her teeth: “Oh my God. It’s going to be her.”

So yes, identity before merit was a principle the Dems clung to even at the expense of marching off an electoral cliff. “If you want to break the Democratic coalition, try to skip over the first African-American vice president,” Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin argued at one point. “I watched the black-white stuff start on Thursday night \[after the debate\],” said another lawmaker. Donna Brazile assembled a team of black women operatives who called themselves “the colored girls” to ensure Harris became the nominee. Jim Clyburn was also a critical supporter: “I’m going all in with Kamala. I don’t want to look back and y’all ain’t there,” he told the DNC.

The open primary therefore never happened. Harris became the nominee for one core reason in the end. Biden, who had previously used the [awfulness of Kamala](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-kamala-chimera-dac) as a way to dissuade anyone from pushing him out, decided to endorse her after she pleaded with him the day he decided to quit. One source “close to both men” explained: “It was a fuck-you to Obama’s plan. At that moment, you have very few things you control, and that’s one thing he had control over, and he chose to stick it to Obama.” So much for putting the survival of democracy first.

And yes, they lied. Jill Biden was one of the worst offenders. She insisted in [January 2024](https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4402609-jill-biden-president-age-asset-2024/), “I see his vigor, I see his energy, I see his passion every single day. I say his age is an asset.” Before the June debate, Joe had been drained by grueling international travel, was catching a cold and couldn’t last more than 45 minutes in the practice debates. But the First Lady went out and told the world: “The president’s feeling great. He’s ready. We’re going to win this thing.” The woman who had covered up her husband’s decline for the previous two years now set expectations that were, of course, utterly ruinous.

Her own former press secretary [said](https://www.mediaite.com/news/biden-insider-admits-campaign-was-gaslighting-public-with-denial-of-presidents-age-concerns-scared-to-death/):

> Cover-up to me is a little hard, a little harsh. Every politician, everybody, every human being tries to cover up age. We were always, from day one, cognizant that age was an issue … The president’s team was scared to death of impromptu, unscripted, un-rehearsed, unpracticed, un-choreographed, anything, they couldn’t compete for the attention economy. They just couldn’t do it.

What were they thinking? Their very actions were rooted in the understanding that Joe Biden couldn’t function as president any longer; and yet they kept insisting he could govern for four more years! This is the much-respected Ron Klain, spinning desperately to conceal his responsibility for Trump 2.0:

> According to Klain, it turned out that Biden “didn’t know what Trump had been saying and couldn’t grasp what the back and forth was”; left preparation and fell asleep by the pool; obsessed about foreign leaders, saying “these guys say I’m doing a great job as president so I must be a great president”; “didn’t really understand what his argument was on inflation”; and “had nothing to say about a second term other than finish the job.”

But Klain was fully behind the president nonetheless. As the campaign reeled after the June debate, it took another month of wasted time to move forward, as Biden sequestered himself with his closest trio of Bruce Reed, Mike Donilon, and Steve Ricchetti, who kept the bubble sealed, tight, and pissed. Even at the time, many worried that Biden was in a cocoon, unaware of his own dismal polling. From [Axios at the time:](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/12/biden-election-inner-circle-withdrawal-criticism)

> “Too many of his top aides are his friends,” said one former Biden aide. Another former aide said the dynamic is less like friends and more like adult children, all vying for their father’s approval. “Mike Donilon needs to tell the president he is losing,” said a third former aide.

But Donilon didn’t. In fact, he still believes Biden should have stayed in the race and would have won. He [vented in February](https://nypost.com/2025/02/23/us-news/top-biden-advisor-mike-donilon-says-party-lost-its-mind-after-debate-it-melted-down/):

> I think the party lost its mind. If you ask people about this period of time, they’ll tell you Biden was losing the polls, he was going to lose. … They were saying this in a margin-of-error race … If you actually go and look at the polling in the first couple of days after the debate, the margin between Trump and Biden got closer. It didn’t get bigger.

That is the kind of blind loyalty that can kill a presidency. But this time, it killed a lot more than that: a chance to keep Trump from power. By his words, Joe Biden told us *that* was the most important thing. By his actions, Biden told us that his own vanity was more important. By their actions, Donilon, Reed, Klain, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, and Dr Jill told us the same. The Democratic Party has a strange habit of never holding the architects of electoral failures accountable. That should end after this.

But in the end, the story of 2024 is painfully, excruciatingly human. Biden’s prickly pride and long-nurtured insecurity, the insularity of his too-loyal circle, and the entitlement that comes from decades of public life at the top all led to collective tragedy. We are now living in the wake of this man’s fallibility and stubbornness. It’s a story we all know well in our private capacities: the tale of trying to get grandpa to give up his car keys before he drives into a ditch and hurts someone.

Well, welcome to the ditch. And the casualties are mounting.

### Back On The Dishcast: Douglas Murray

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3721f6fe-1781-41f0-bda1-e92c66df5c59_1033x343.jpeg)

Douglas is a writer and commentator. He’s an associate editor at The Spectator and a columnist for the New York Post and The Sun, as well as a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. His books include *The Madness of Crowds* and *The War on the West*, which we discussed on the Dishcast three years ago. His new book is *On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilization*. We had a lively, sometimes contentious session — first on Trump, then on Israel’s tactics in Gaza.

This episode and a forthcoming one with Francis Collins were challenges. How to push back against someone who is your guest? I never wanted the Dishcast to be an interrogation, an Andrew Neil-style interview. But I also wanted it to air debate, so I try to play devil’s advocate when appropriate. I’m sure you’ll let me know how I’m doing after this one.

**Listen to the episode [here](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/douglas-murray-on-israel-and-deportations)**. There you can find two clips of our convo — on Palestinians “endlessly rejecting peace,” and debating the Khalil case. That link also takes you to a bunch of commentary on Nick Denton’s appraisal of China’s dominance, along with many responses from Nick.

“One of the only upsides of this massive exercise in auto-erotic self-junk-punching, is that unlike all other economic crises of my lifetime, it won’t be difficult or controversial to assign causality and political blame,” - [Jonah Goldberg](https://x.com/JonahDispatch/status/1908128407839248720) on Trump’s “Liberation Day.”

“We now live in an age where Argentina is run by a libertarian and the US is run by a Peronist,” - [Braden Pace](https://x.com/bradenpace/status/1906166858341879937).

“Your estimation of both the old GOP establishment and Deep State should go up seeing how they were able to deliver a relatively stable presidency under Trump now that we’ve seen what happens when he can actually do what he wants,” - [Richard Hanania](https://x.com/richardhanania/status/1906584223848554946).

“Per capita more Danish soldiers were killed in the Afghan war than were American soldiers. Do we remember them? Thank them?” - [Tim Snyder](https://snyder.substack.com/p/vance-in-greenland) on Vance’s trip to a US military base in Greenland.

“The Prime Minister of Denmark believes that Ukraine is better off fighting than accepting a peace settlement under Trump’s policies. So it would be fair to take Greenland out of her. She is a murderer,” - [Alexander Dugin](https://newrepublic.substack.com/p/denmark-just-took-hillbilly-jd-vance), Putinist philosopher.

“Here’s an example of the ‘rigorous vetting’ of gang membership that the Trump admin claims it’s doing: A woman admitted that her dead ex-husband, who she left 10 years ago, had been a TdA member. From that — and nothing more! — ICE declared she ‘is a senior member of the TDA,’” - [Aaron Reichlin-Melnick](https://x.com/ReichlinMelnick/status/1905749237121605771).

“This unusual level of control makes *The White Lotus* the polar opposite of, say, the Marvel films, which feel like they’re written by one committee, edited by another, and marketed by a third. And what has \[Mike\] White done with his unusual level of creative control? He has made the first great work of art in the post-‘woke’ era,” - [Helen Lewis](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/white-lotus-is-post-woke-art/682231/) in a superb review of the series.

“Jewish students need to be protected. They should be valued as much as anyone else. But on the other hand, protecting them shouldn’t require us to shred the norms that we use to protect other people. I don’t think it’s either or. I think it can be both/and,” - [Jonathan Greenblatt](https://jewishinsider.com/2025/04/adl-jonathan-greenblatt-trump-deportation-campaign-antisemitism/), the ADL’s CEO.

“\[Trump\] may not just kick out of the country people whose presence here displeases him.... Like most national security conservatives, I believe the distinction between citizens and aliens (even lawful permanent resident aliens who are on track to become citizens) is significant, and that the government should have broad powers to exclude and deport aliens... But that doesn’t mean that aliens have no rights,” - [Andrew McCarthy](https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/03/trump-can-easily-fix-the-tren-de-aragua-deportation-mess/), who “spent nearly 20 years prosecuting alien criminals and terrorists.”

“For those asking: yes, \[my\] voting for Trump was a mistake. I thought we’d get a repeat of the first administration, but we didn’t. The signs were there, I just did not take my own ideas about the awfulness of Trump and MAGA seriously enough,” - [Richard Hanania](https://x.com/richardhanania/status/1907908222025085241).

### Dissents Of The Week

A reader thinks my rhetoric was too heated in my column on Trump’s “two perfect months”:

> Do you think you could tone down on your use of “fascism”, which seems to be proliferating? My point is not to diminish the alarming aspects of the current administration. My point is the opposite: so much of our political discourse has devolved into name-calling.
> 
> Has anyone ever become more skeptical of Israel’s behavior toward Palestinians when they heard protesters screaming in the street about “genocide” and “apartheid”? Has anyone ever been persuaded when they heard activists assert that X (controversial politician or state) equals Y (recognizably terrible politician or state)?
> 
> Intensity of vocabulary doesn’t replace soundness of arguments. The NYT had a [terrific piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/magazine/genocide-definition.html) about how the word “genocide” is a moral (I’m tempted to say perlocutionary) term, not a descriptive one. It’s invoked to stir action, not to depict reality. And the generalized use of the word “fascism” since the 1940s to attack any perceived excess in power has voided it of all power, except to discredit the person who employs it. Can we keep the focus on substance, not labels?

In my defense, I used the f-word twice in the column — and both were qualified. I described those who hold due process in contempt as “ *wannabe* fascists.” And I said that posing in front of a jail packed with near-naked prisoners was “fascist *ic* ”. I agree the term can confuse as much as enlighten. But grabbing people off the streets with no due process and exulting in others’ misery definitely have f-vibes.

Another dissent:

> Your thesaurus really got a workout last week: *indecency, aggression, lawlessness, bitter, vengeful, incompetent man, third-rate sycophants and hacks, no coherent strategy, degenerate, disgrace, shit-show, authoritarian, dangerous reckless, intolerant, contemptuous, tyranny, contempt*.
> 
> Drama and hyperbole much, Andrew? Millions and millions of people voted for and signed up for the exact work to be done by Trump, Musk, Miller, Patel, Bondi, Hegseth — the whole 9 yards. The Democrats built up the swamp for years, slowly ceding control of dollars and power to radical far-left progressives to enrich and empower themselves. We expected it was going to be a messy cleanup and that they weren’t going to just let go easily of what they built. Good riddance to the vast majority of them, their departments, and their pet projects.

Alrighty then. As always, please keep the dissents coming: **dish@andrewsullivan.com**.
