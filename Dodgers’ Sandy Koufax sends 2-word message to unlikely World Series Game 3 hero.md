The Los Angeles Dodgers enjoyed plenty of standout performances during a historic, 18-inning victory in Game 3 against the Toronto Blue Jays on Monday.

First and foremost, there was Shohei Ohtani, who reached base nine times, homered twice and was intentionally walked four times. Then there was Freddie Freeman, who hit the walk-off homer to seal the victory for the Dodgers.

But iconic Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax, widely regarded as the best left-handed hurler in the history of the sport, singled out a more unlikely hero for special attention after the game.

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 10: Hall of fame member and former Los Angeles Dodger Sandy Koufax looks on before the game against the Pittsburgh Pi...

“Into the Dodgers’ clubhouse strode Sandy Koufax, his eminence of Dodgers pitching, who, at 89 years old, looked no worse for the wear at 12:48 a.m.,” according to [ESPN’s Jeff Passan](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46753415/world-series-game-3-history-18-innings-los-angeles-dodgers-walkoff-freddie-freeman). “Koufax walked up to (Will) Klein, stuck out his hand, looked him in the eyes and said: ‘Nice going.’”

Klein pitched in just 14 games for the Dodgers during the regular season, earning 21 strikeouts and giving up 14 hits. But after the team wore through its bullpen during the extra-innings battle with the Blue Jays, he was called upon to pitch four innings and held the opponent to just one hit with five strikeouts across 72 pitches.

It was the kind of unlikely, heroic performance that earned the respect of a franchise legend like Koufax, even if the extra workload will wear on Klein’s arm in the aftermath.

“This was that kind of game, the one that forges bonds between a Hall of Famer and a man with 22 2/3 career major league innings who didn’t make the Dodgers’ roster in any of the previous three rounds of the postseason,” Passan added. “(Klein) was the winning pitcher, the stopper, the MVP of the night every bit as much as Freeman and Ohtani, and the adrenaline rush numbed whatever pain will eventually arrive.”

As the Dodgers look to extend their series lead over the Blue Jays and earn a second consecutive championship, they might need some more unlikely heroes to step up like Klein did.
