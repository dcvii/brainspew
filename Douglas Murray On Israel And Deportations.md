Douglas is a writer and commentator. He’s an associate editor at The Spectator and a columnist for both the New York Post and The Sun, as well as a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. His books include _The Madness of Crowds_ and _The War on the West_, which we discussed on the Dishcast [three years ago](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/douglas-murray-on-defending-the-west). His new book is _[On Democracies and Death Cults](https://www.amazon.com/Democracies-Death-Cults-Israel-Civilization-ebook/dp/B0D4CBP9VW/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0): Israel and the Future of Civilization_. We had a lively, sometimes contentious session — first on Trump, then on Israel’s tactics in Gaza.

This episode and a forthcoming one with Francis Collins were challenges. How to push back against someone who is your guest? I never wanted the Dishcast to be an interrogation, an Andrew Neil-style interview. But I also wanted it to air debate, so I try to play devil’s advocate when appropriate. I’m sure you’ll let me know how I’m doing after this one.

For two clips of our convo — on Palestinians “endlessly rejecting peace,” and debating the Khalil case — pop over to [our YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/DailyDishHosting/videos).

Other topics: the pros and cons of Trump 2.0 for Douglas; his time on the frontlines in Ukraine; the “horrifying” WH meeting with Zelensky; mineral reparations; North Korean conscripts; aggressing Greenland; Blame Canada; the Signal chat; Vance’s disdain for Europe; the Houthis; MAGA isolationists; targeting law firms; race and sex discrimination under Biden; Trump defunding the Ivies; anti-Semitism on campus; the Columbia protests and criminality; the Alien Enemies Act and the 1952 law; the Ozturk case; the horrors of 10/7; Hezbollah’s aborted invasion; the bombing of Gaza; human shields; dead children; hostages like Edan Alexander; Gazan protests against Hamas; the Israeli dentist who saved Sinwar’s life; 9/11 and religious extremism; the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza; Ben-Gurion; Zionism; pogroms in the wake of 1948; audio clips of Hitchens and Bill Burr; the view that only Jews can protect Jews; Rushdie; the hearts and minds of Gazans; John Spencer; just war theory; Trump’s Mar-a-Gaza; the West Bank settlements; ethnic cleansing; Smotrich; and the fate of a two-state solution after 10/7.

On [last week’s episode](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/nick-denton-our-new-chinese-overlords) with Nick Denton, here’s a “longtime Dish subscriber (paid, of course), but it’s the first time I’m reaching out”:

> Your chat with Denton was riveting and challenging. I think his point about American political paralysis blinding us to an ascendant China is especially valid.

Nick responds:

> Carl Sagan did have that foreboding — of such distractions that a cataclysm could unfold without the populace even noticing. The woke wars have occupied our most serious intellectuals, and before that the war on terror was a few trillion dollars down the drain — and most expensive of all, the attention devoted to an economically marginal part of the world. There is a wonderful clip of LKY shaking his head in irritation as Charlie Rose brings up American policy in Afghanistan, again. “It is a distraction,” he says. The question is just dumb.

From another listener:

> What an incredible episode!
> 
> Nick asks: without Silicon Valley and Hollywood, what does the US have other than natural resources? Here’s the full quote:
> 
> > Russia is a toxic country. It’s as toxic as any of these natural-resources countries. The reason why probably Trump identifies with it, is because America is rapidly on the track to becoming a kind of revisionist, natural-resource, would-be-a-colony if it didn’t have nukes. So of course they have a commonality of interest. Take away Silicon Valley, take away Hollywood. What do you have?
> 
> I’d like to bring attention to the public universities across the Midwest that are among the best in science and engineering. That’s what attracts top foreign students to the country and feeds Silicon Valley. (I went to school with Levchin — the technical brain behind the “PayPal mafia” — and I only missed Andreessen by one year.) Those institutions predate Silicon Valley, and I sincerely hope they will outlast Silicon Valley.

Nick responds:

> Yes, there is an American heartland that could emerge from this — maybe Urbana can be the capital. Tom Wolfe’s [story of the founding of Silicon Valley](https://classic.esquire.com/article/share/58ff278a-21da-4ee4-a446-b7f451b90275) explores Robert Noyce’s Midwestern beginnings. The Valley could still return to that Anglo-German tradition.

Another listener:

> Your conversation with Nick Denton on China concerned a topic that is vastly important but currently underreported because of Trump’s various outrageous orders and statements. I’m glad you asked Denton several times about his apparent indifference about China’s totalitarianism and lack of individual rights. His responses ranged from evasive to specious. It’s a chilling reminder that too many tech-obsessed people seem not to care much about democracy.

Nick responds:

> You’re right. I didn’t want to get bogged down in a discussion of democratic values. Plenty of people for that; I’m simply evaluating quality of governance and economic growth.

That same listener continues:

> As for the world entering a Chinese era, Denton never addressed China’s greatest long-term problem: population collapse. Their population has dropped in absolute numbers for three years running, and their replacement rate is [dropping below 1.0](https://www.newsweek.com/china-plan-tackle-birth-rate-population-crisis-2041107). Demographic researchers note that in areas where birth rates can be ascertained independently, China inflates their figures. So their population decline may have started dropping several years earlier than reported, and their replacement rate may be dropping below 0.9.
> 
> The Chinese government is aware of the looming catastrophe. They’ve already announced that care for the elderly will fall on families and local soup kitchens rather than the national government. By the end of this century, China stands to lose more than half of their population — a loss of over 700 million people. And the people remaining will be disproportionately old. Marriage rates in China are collapsing as we speak.
> 
> How does Denton explain how China will maintain its “supremacy” when it becomes the world’s largest nursing home? America’s replacement rate is nowhere near as bad — about 1.6 — and legal immigration can keep us stable. The silence of pro-China enthusiasts like Denton on this unavoidable issue is deafening.

Nick again:

> Yeah, not even LKY could solve the demographic crisis. Arguably, the robot revolution makes the home-care crunch less acute. But only if you have the engineers to design the robots.

Another looks to the EV industry:

> Nick Denton points to BYD overtaking Tesla and the persistent claim that China is way ahead of the US and all their manufacturers. Nonsense. God help me, Andrew, I’ve driven a year-old BYD and it’s dreadful. Of course Tesla isn’t selling as well — because they cost 4x the equivalent of a BYD vehicle. Plus, BYD has a huge hybrid-engine division, which Tesla prides itself on NOT having. Who isn’t going to choose the cheaper car?
> 
> China constantly claims they’re always ahead and always doing better than the US. We never see those gains. For example, BYD’s five-minute full-battery-charge [claim](https://www.wired.com/story/byd-5-minute-ev-charging/) hasn’t been proven in the real world, and it’s likely “creatively interpreted” to drive up the stock price. Why do that? Because BYD is tens of billions of dollars in debt.
> 
> China has better engineering and design? No, they’re better IP thieves and have better production capacity. DeepSeek stole code from ChatGPT. BYD copied Tesla.
> 
> I agree with how dangerous China is. No one is in danger from a swimmer, but a drowning man will grab at anything he can on the way down.

Nick responds:

> I didn’t say that China was dangerous, merely that it would win this industrial race. What started as copying, has turned of necessity into innovation. And it’s unwise to lecture China about empty claims — when they’re up against Trump and Musk, two showmen of the highest order.
> 
> Better to examine the clips for glitches, wait for validated racetrack speeds, and make like-for-like comparisons, as you would any two products. I’m a fan of BYD’s economics rather than its models. But the Xiaomi SU7 is an example of digital integration, manufacturing automation, and excellent design coming together.

Another turns to urban planning:

> Many of Denton’s pronouncements I agreed with or found interesting, but there is no modesty, no hesitancy, no self-doubt or questioning in ANY of it. There are so many things I could comment on that picking just a few is very hard, but I will try.
> 
> First of all, the fact that Denton tries to use the entire built-up megalopolis of the Chinese coastal cities as an example that the East Coast should be is — from an architect’s perspective (and I would imagine any environmentalist’s as well) — the worst thing I could ever imagine. He said nothing about what that does to the environment, let alone to the psyche of people living there. Not once does he even mention that in China, almost everyone has to live in high-rise towers that are the building blocks of those very bleak and often very monotonous cities he keeps using as the example for some aspects of the “greatness” of China. Remember people locked up in those towers during Covid? Nightmare. Dystopia.
> 
> I put Denton up there with the other “know-it-all nothing,” Ezra Klein, in thinking they can force a vision of how Americans should be living onto a society that cherishes property rights, derived from a long history of property rights in Western culture. Singapore (which Denton kept praising) was built mostly from a _tabula rasa_, and that involves authoritarianism of the state-sponsored type to be able to achieve it. As a model for a society based on humanism and the individual, you just cannot even begin to square it.
> 
> This terrifying idea of a megalopolis running from Richmond up to Boston may yet be in our future, but I truly hope that this doesn’t go down without a real fight. Because if the left has its way, they will be declaring eminent domain in the next 15-20 years to achieve this “urban megalopolis,” since it’s impossible to do so otherwise.

Nick responds:

> These Chinese megacities are actually clusters connected by high-speed rail. So the Yangtze Delta isn’t one sprawl. Let’s take a different perspective: from the gardens of Suzhou, or the alleys of Tianzifang, or Jiaxing’s station-in-a-park.
> 
> Yes, the Yangtze Delta has a population of 60m within an hour of Shanghai by rail. But living standards and urban amenities are improving fast. Why wouldn’t Greater Shanghai be the greatest city the world has ever seen?

One more on the episode:

> Could you please challenge your guests more? It would have been as fascinating to listen to Nick Denton on the flaws of China, not just his admiration for a heavily subsidised Chinese economy that at some point will have to win in a free market. The way you [questioned Michelle Goldberg](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/michelle-goldberg-on-harris-and-the) on the Cass Report was wonderful; I just wish you had used the same approach with Denton.
> 
> There were obvious faults in his analysis, especially around the demographic decline in China, the real-estate bubble, and the totalitarian system cracking down on entrepreneurs like Jack Ma. Systemically the Chinese economy should always be as suspect, as it does not have the market forces that drive success in the US, or the circuit breaker of democracy to stop political excesses. Liberal democracy and the free market may be messy, but they have outcompeted every other system in history, so I wouldn’t bet against them.

I did my best to ask the right questions, but I’m not the expert here. Here’s Nick once more:

> It has indeed been a bad idea to bet against liberal democracy. You could argue that Bismarck’s was the last serious departure, and that was 150 years ago.
> 
> And I was brought up, like you, to think that alternation of power and checks and balances galore were essential. But I’ve been waiting for nepotism to ruin Singapore, for the last 30 years. And I’m still waiting.

Huge thanks to Nick for addressing those dissents. Here’s a quick rec for a future guest:

> I just want to sing your praises, from here in sunny southern Spain, and to thank you for publishing [that photo](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/two-perfect-months-506) of Ozturk’s abduction. It broke my heart. How visuals can say so much. And please give some thought to having [Chris Hedges](https://chrishedges.substack.com/about) on your podcast. We need to hear him on Gaza and the powers of AIPAC.

Another reader points to a [new exposé](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/2025-03-29/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu-confidant-expedited-qatari-cash-to-gaza-at-hamas-request/00000195-e395-da7e-adb7-fb9d30570000?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=Content&utm_campaign=daily-brief&utm_content=86f1363afc) in _Haaretz_: “Billionaire Netanyahu Confidant Expedited Qatari Cash Deliveries to Gaza, at Hamas’ Request.” The reader adds:

> The new exposé, of course, is in line with existing criticism of Netanyahu [cynically supporting Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) over the past decade:
> 
> > For years, the various governments led by Benjamin Netanyahu took an approach that divided power between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank — bringing Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to his knees while making moves that propped up the Hamas terror group. The idea was to prevent Abbas … from advancing toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. Thus, amid this bid to impair Abbas, Hamas was upgraded from a mere terror group to an organization with which Israel held indirect negotiations via Egypt, and one that was allowed to receive infusions of cash from abroad.
> 
> A legal resident of the United States can get kicked out the country for attending a protest against Israel or writing an op-ed. So, the next time Netanyahu comes to the US, should ICE nab him off the street, throw him in a cell, then deport him for funneling money to Hamas?

Another comments on [last week’s column](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/two-perfect-months):

> We are truly living out this prescient quote [from David Frum](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/) (but on multiple fronts, not just immigration): “If liberals insist that only fascists will enforce borders, then voters will hire fascists to do the job liberals refuse to do.”

Indeed. I tried to raise the alarm but I was just another white supremacist, wasn’t I? Another reader has a question:

> Before the election you stated that Trump v Harris was a close call but Vance v Harris was a no-brainer (in Vance’s favor). Do you stand by that?

For me, Trump vs Harris was not a close call — because of Trump’s proven unfitness for the office. My views on Vance reached their most positive after the veep debate, where I was hoping for signs of a post-Trump conservatism. But even then, I noted Vance’s [core weakness](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/why-vance-matters-8a4): “He has to remain committed to [The Big Lie], because he is Trump’s vassal.” And I called that “disqualifying”. I had also [previously warned](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-calculation-of-jd-vance-06e) that he was incapable of separating Trumpism from Trump:

> Juggling the legitimate insights of Trumpism _and_ the lying, livid lunacy of Trump himself makes for an unedifying but instructive spectacle. Vance has made the bet. Excusing political violence, supporting a deranged fantasist, and delegitimizing free and fair elections is the price he is prepared to pay for power. And it’s a bet, I’m afraid, he is increasingly likely to win.

In the new administration, Vance appears to have internalized every bad Trump impulse and supported every reckless Trump policy, while throwing rhetorical bombs at anyone who fires back.

This next reader quotes a federal employee we heard from [recently](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/mike-white-on-transcending-identity):

> > Sure, there are idiots and assholes who don’t deserve their jobs in government, just like everywhere else. But to have an entire section of the American population actually jeering at people who are upset over losing their jobs ... wow. Would Americans do that to any other group? And what other instances are there of a group of employees whose employers are leading the jeering and derision?
> 
> Americans aren’t generally subject to “jeering at people who are upset over losing their jobs,” because when the rest of us get laid off, we don’t whine in public with a large audience amplified by a sympathetic establishment press. I’ve been subject to mass layoffs many times. Most often it was because my employer had messed up (sometimes by over-hiring), and had little to do with my performance or job function. Each time I had some expectation of personal sympathy from my friends, but I never felt entitled to the sort of outraged public sympathy that your reader seems to expect.
> 
> Mass layoffs of federal employees will lead to a small but measurable improvement in either the deficit or taxes. Taxpayers are entitled to be happy about that, even if _some_ of the employees should have been kept.

Another reader flags a [piece](https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/03/lawyers-say-oregon-genital-cutting-law-discriminates-against-boys-seek-circumcision-ban.html) in the Oregonian titled “Lawyers say Oregon genital cutting law discriminates against boys; seek circumcision ban,” adding, “This unusual lawsuit may be worth a look.” Don’t tempt me. You know how mad I get about male genial mutilation.

And another:

> I saw you on Bill Maher, I agree with you 99% of the time, so I was so glad when you said to Ezra Klein something along the lines of, “If Dems don’t reckon with the gender nonsense and other stuff, then what Ezra is talking about won’t matter.” I was cheering. I like Ezra and think his thesis is correct, but like all Dems, they want to pretend the Dems haven’t done the damage they have done.
> 
> There is a cognitive dissonance with Dems. Biden had the Justice Department go after red states that wanted to protect youths from the trans cult, but they never brought it up in the convention or the campaign. If you guys are so proud of this, why don’t you broadcast it?
> 
> P.S. Check out Jonah Wheeler in New Hampshire. The rare dissenting Dem on gender:

Thanks as always for the emails, and send yours to **dish@andrewsullivan.com**.

You can also sound off in [my Notes feed](https://substack.com/@sullydish). I wrote this week:

> Do you remember the Twitter files, an exposé of how the federal government pressured the company to shape opinions on Covid etc.? Today, X is owned by the second most powerful man in the federal government and is openly dedicated to spewing pro-administration propaganda day and night. It is State Social Media, a product of an authoritarian government, intent on gaslighting from Musk.

A reader responded:

> Respectfully, do you think Elon should be required to self-silence? And, would your feeling change if his opinions happened to align with your own?

My response:

> No, he can post a hundred times a day — but he could allow us to block him so we don’t have to see his insane impulses indulged morning noon and night. Forcing people to listen to you is the mark of a dictatorial mindset.
> 
> And yes, of course he has switched the algorithms to foment violence, racial hatred, anti-semitism and every variety of bigotry.

That debate continues [here](https://substack.com/@sullydish/note/c-105393912). I also commented on an [Advocate piece](https://www.advocate.com/news/transgender-men-banned-texas-campground) titled, “Outrage follows after Texas gay campground doubles-down on banning transgender men from property”:

> A vacation camp for gay men is demonized by queers for wanting to keep the camp … for gay men. That’s where we are now.
> 
> Heterosexual biological women who are jacked up with testosterone are neither gay nor men in the context of a space for gay men to be with one another. In law and society they should be treated as men, but not at the expense of destroying gay male spaces. The transqueers, however, are intent on delegitimizing homosexuality. And these homophobes now run all gay and lesbian media and all gay and lesbian organizations.
> 
> Gay men are beginning to fight back. But there’s a long way to go.

One more email for the week:

> I’m currently standing in Icons — the OTHER gay bar in Colorado Springs. (After the shooting a couple of years ago, you may have read the reports that Club Q was the only gay bar in Colorado Springs; they lied.) I regret to inform you that THIS is on the wall, showing Marsha P. Johnson:

Well, I have no problem with remembering Johnson. He was a colorful figure among the street kids, drag queens, and homeless gender-benders for years and deserves credit for all that. But he did not instigate Stonewall, wasn’t there on the night, and has no central role in the history of the gay rights movement which began decades before he was born.

You want some heroes? Try [Frank Kameny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Kameny), the first man to sue the federal government when they fired him for being gay in the 1950s. But Kameny is largely ignored by the transqueer groups in favor of minor characters like Johnson, because he was white and male and gay. The only heroes they want are non-white, non-binary and queer. Bigotry everywhere — and deep in the woke mindset.

See you next Friday.
