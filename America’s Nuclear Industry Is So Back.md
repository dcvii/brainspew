What if I told you that the light in your home—and the heat in your oven and the juice in your laptop—is brought to you by the Russian state?

Since 1993, America has [spent billions](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=13091) buying enriched uranium produced by Russia’s state-run nuclear [energy company](https://www.sipri.org/publications/2019/eu-non-proliferation-and-disarmament-papers/russias-nuclear-energy-exports-status-prospects-and-implications); it helps fuel America’s [54 nuclear power plants](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php), and the 20 percent of our electrical grid powered by nuclear energy.

Days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Biden’s administration [imposed sanctions](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/three-years-war-ukraine-are-sanctions-against-russia-making-difference) to debilitate Russia’s participation in the global economy—freezing $5 billion of Russian assets in the U.S., seizing the property of oligarchs, and [banning the import](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/08/fact-sheet-united-states-bans-imports-of-russian-oil-liquefied-natural-gas-and-coal/) of coal and fossil fuels from Russia.

But it wasn’t until two years later that the Biden administration [announced a ban](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-enacts-law-banning-importation-russian-uranium) on Russian uranium, and it isn’t set to take effect until 2028. Why? Because America had become [almost wholly dependent](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/russia-happy-to-keep-supplying-enriched-uranium-to-usa) on Russia for this fuel.

Since Biden’s announcement early last year, there has been a scramble to figure out how America—once the dominant global force behind nuclear power—can reshore enrichment, the process by which uranium is turned into fuel for use in nuclear reactors. And the federal government has been looking to the private sector for support. In May 2024, as part of a wider effort to “ [secure a nuclear fuel supply chain](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/4-crucial-steps-biden-harris-administration-taking-secure-nuclear-fuel-supply-chain?utm_source=chatgpt.com),” the Biden administration [announced that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-16/us-to-offer-up-to-3-4-billion-for-nuclear-fuel-makers-in-june) government contracts worth $3.4 billion in total would be up for grabs. The winners would be private companies that could enrich uranium into fuel, and do it domestically.

Last October, a few weeks before the presidential election, the Biden administration [announced that](https://www.govconwire.com/articles/doe-uranium-enrichment-support-contract) it had selected four companies for a $2.7 billion contract. One of them was General Matter—the company that, a few weeks ago, became the first-ever start-up to establish a nuclear enrichment facility in America, in Paducah, Kentucky.

A few days after the groundbreaking ceremony on August 5, I called Lee Robinson, a founding member of General Matter.

“Imagine a world where every reactor being built around the world leads to a long tail of dependence on China and Russia,” he said. “Imagine a world where our grid is unstable because we don’t have our own reactors. Where we have submarines and aircraft carriers that are dry-docked because we can’t fuel them. That’s the world we could be living in, in 2040.”

Robinson, 40, who until recently worked for the Department of Defense, painted a dire picture of the near future.

He said commercial nuclear reactors would face fuel shortages by the end of the 2020s; nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers by the end of the 2030s. New AI data centers, which are essential if we are to maintain an edge over Chinese competitors, will require double the amount of energy than the entire city of Philadelphia, and there won’t be enough electricity to power them. Blackouts and brownouts— [already experienced](https://abc7.com/post/will-californias-power-grid-handle-latest-heat-wave/15265053/) in parts of California during summer heat waves—would spread across the country. Electricity bills for ordinary Americans would soar. China—which has [rapidly expanded](https://www.ft.com/content/f86782fa-9f2e-448a-b710-29e787dc9831?utm_source=chatgpt.com) the size of its electrical grid over the past 10 years, whereas ours hasn’t grown significantly in decades—would leap ahead of America in industrial and technological might, driven by the sheer supply of energy produced by its power plants.

Not if General Matter can help it.

“All of America’s ambitions rely on energy,” said Scott Nolan, who founded the company alongside Robinson and serves as CEO. “So General Matter’s goal is to bring back domestic capability for making nuclear fuel.”

But how did we lose it in the first place?

In the decades after the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania [went live](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/power-and-energy/first-us-commercial-nuclear-plant-opens) in 1957 as the world’s first nuclear reactor for commercial use, the U.S. was a global leader in enrichment, manufacturing over 90 percent of the world’s fuel for nuclear reactors, according to Nolan.

But “when new capabilities came online in the late ’60s and ’70s, other countries leapt ahead of the U.S.,” said Robinson. “This is where the U.S. government doesn’t innovate fast enough.”

By the 1990s, Nolan explained, “we had old, first-generation technology that was higher cost than international suppliers. And after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we said: ‘Free trade is the future! Globalism is the future! We do not need to do this ourselves, when the Europeans and Russians can do this at a lower cost*.’*  ”

So, Nolan said, “We offshored it.”

From the 1980s through today, the share of electricity in the U.S. generated by nuclear power has remained [essentially unchanged](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/outline-history-of-nuclear-energy?utm_source=chatgpt.com). “We hadn’t built many new reactors,” said Nolan. There was growing unease around their alleged dangers after disasters in Three Mile Island near Middletown, Pennsylvania, in 1979, and Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, and growth had stalled.

From the 1980s through today, the share of electricity in the U.S. generated by nuclear power has remained essentially unchanged.

In 2013, President Barack Obama capped a decades-long period of stagnation by [shutting down the last domestic producer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323475304578503321283164066) of fuel for nuclear reactors—which happened to be in Paducah, on the very same site where General Matter is now trying to stage America’s nuclear comeback.

That move, 12 years ago, guaranteed that America would [become dependent](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64444) on [foreign sources](https://www.eia.gov/uranium/marketing/table16.php) of enriched uranium. Today, 27 percent of it comes from Russia—more than any other foreign supplier—and 12 percent from France. The remainder is imported from Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK—with a small portion made in the U.S. by a European company. But none of these Western European countries produce the specific type of enriched uranium, known as high-assay low-enriched uranium, needed for advanced reactors.

When the ban on Russian imports goes into full effect, in three years’ time, Nolan said: “We will have fuel shortages in the U.S.”

Compounding the pressure of this deadline is the Trump administration’s recently announced goal of quadrupling the electrical output of nuclear reactors by 2050. In May, the president [signed four](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/9-key-takeaways-president-trumps-executive-orders-nuclear-energy) executive orders aimed at establishing “energy dominance”—policy dependent on the fuel that General Matter plans to produce.

“Everything I’ve worked on has always been trying to advance an important industry,” Nolan, 44, told me. An aerospace engineer by trade, he spoke with the steady, precise demeanor of someone well seasoned in translating complex nuclear jargon into stark phrases that conveyed the stakes of his project.

“There were two industries from the ’50s that American society thought were going to be very important ones. One was space, the other was nuclear,” Nolan said, but when he graduated from Cornell in 2004, both industries were in free fall.

Nolan chose to begin with the former, taking a job as an engineer at SpaceX, a start-up founded by Elon Musk in 2002 that would become the first private company to launch a rocket into orbit.

“The way to actually bring an industry forward is often by starting a new company,” said Nolan. He witnessed, from a front-row seat, how SpaceX helped bring an end to the stagnation in growth and innovation that plagued NASA at the turn of the millennium.

In 2007**,** he left SpaceX and did a stint in consulting at Bain & Company before joining Founders Fund, Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm. There, Nolan turned his attention to finding and investing in a company that could modernize the nuclear energy sector, in the same way SpaceX modernized the U.S.’s aeronautical industry.

“I spent over a year at Founders Fund looking for the right company to invest in nuclear,” he told me. During this period, he encountered company after company aiming to build advanced, modern nuclear reactors—but each one of them faced the same problem.

“They could not get nuclear fuel from anywhere except for Russia,” Nolan said.

It made innovation a moot point. Why construct new nuclear power plants if, by 2028, importing their fuel would be impossible?

“I didn’t find any company I was confident would solve the problem,” Nolan observed. “Which was why I decided to start General Matter in 2023, to solve it.”

He compared General Matter to companies like Palantir and Anduril, which have [disrupted and transformed](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/is-the-us-ready-for-the-next-war) the defense industry by privately manufacturing military products—from nimble drones to software—and selling them to the government, reversing the typical cycle of procurement.

Robinson, meanwhile, left a career in finance to join the military in 2015. By 2021, he had joined the Defense Innovation Unit, a Defense Department organization headquartered in Silicon Valley. There, Robinson looked for emerging technologies in the energy sector that could prove useful to the military.

After meeting Nolan in the fall of 2023, Robinson said,“Scott was the first to push me on: ‘Hey, how bad is this uranium supply chain?’ ”

“What I found on the government side,” Robinson said, “was that the issue was far worse than anybody on the commercial side knew.”

Scott Nolan, founder of General Matter, compared his company to Palantir and Anduril, both of which have transformed the defense industry.

“Because of how fraught our energy supply chains were, the reason we might lose a global conflict was because of energy security,” he explained. “It wasn’t because of weapons capability or because of troop readiness.” Around the end of 2020, he said, the Defense Department “began to recognize the need for nuclear power to provide a vital part of our energy resiliency.”

After a series of meetings with Nolan and a handshake, Robinson left the agency to help build General Matter, believing it to be the most important thing he will ever do.

Robinson said he did extensive “nuclear tourism” in search of an ideal site for the plant and that their reception in Kentucky was “the warmest you could have.” The majority of the community in Paducah, “their great-grandfathers, or grandfathers,” he said, “built the enrichment facility that industrialized enrichment. I think it’s the facility that probably won the Cold War. So they understand nuclear, and they know what it means to both the community and what it means to the nation.”

The state of Kentucky provided General Matter with $100 million in incentives to build its facility in Paducah, according to Robinson, and the opening ceremony this month was attended by a bipartisan delegation of Kentucky governor Andy Beshear and Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul.

General Matter’s rise also coincided with a [major cultural shift](https://news.gallup.com/poll/659180/nuclear-energy-support-near-record-high.aspx) in support of nuclear energy, driven by what Nolan dubbed a “post-partisan” consensus that the problem of offshored uranium enrichment had to be addressed.

“I think it was the right realizing that emitting more carbon is not a good experiment to run, and the left realizing that wind and solar won’t get us there,” said Nolan. “The only thing that can solve clean, safe, abundant energy affordably is actually nuclear.”

In recent years, a number of major artificial intelligence innovators have also become nuclear converts. “At the end of the day, the bottleneck in AI is not chips, it’s not algorithms. It’s actually just energy,” said Nolan. AI companies are asking: How can we expand capacity dramatically?

Microsoft [is re-opening](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5120581/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-microsoft-ai) the nuclear plant at Three Mile Island just to power its AI data center. Amazon [invested in nuclear start-ups](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-nuclear-small-modular-reactor-net-carbon-zero) building small modular reactors. Meta [signed a 20-year deal](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/meta-signs-20-year-deal-with-nuclear-plant-signals-ais-growing-energy-needs) to purchase electricity directly from an Illinois nuclear power plant.

Robinson and Nolan view the embrace of nuclear power by Silicon Valley and the U.S. government as somewhat of an inevitability—as [they frequently say](https://generalmatter.com/mission/), it is “the most perfect form of energy ever discovered.”

Where President Donald Trump speaks in terms of *dominance*, they offered a different word.

“What energy dominance means,” Nolan said, is really “energy *abundance* ”—a reality in which America will have a surplus of energy to power reindustrialization and technological innovation. Energy abundance, Nolan often repeats, is [closely linked](https://visualizingenergy.org/what-is-the-relationship-between-energy-use-and-economic-output/) with GDP and human flourishing.

That’s why General Matter isn’t just aiming to delink the U.S. from Russia and China, but also to lower the costs of energy for American citizens. He and Robinson talk about their revival of nuclear energy as a moral duty, one that will protect America from external threats and improve life within our borders, unleashing economic growth and prosperity.

“Five years from now, we’re going to be operational,” Robinson said. “We’re effectively bringing back an American industry, starting with this plot of land.”
