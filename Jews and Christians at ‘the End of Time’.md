There are episodes in history that never quite end. One occurred around the Mediterranean in the middle of the first century CE, when the first followers of Jesus emerged from Judea with a powerful story about their charismatic teacher, his execution by Roman authorities in Jerusalem, and his resurrection.

Members of this small group of Jews believed they held the key to understanding God’s plan and that they must spread the news fast because time itself was about to end. Their ideas and furious arguments, conducted in person and in letters that crisscrossed the Roman world, continue to shape our own.

It’s impossible to understand our era—not just religious life but the content of TikTok and YouTube, the speeches at a memorial for [Charlie Kirk](https://www.thefp.com/p/je-suis-charlie-kirk), a campus protest against Israel—without understanding this small number of people struggling through a few decades of turmoil 2,000 years ago.

[Paula Fredriksen](https://www.bu.edu/religion/faculty/paula-fredriksen/) splits her time between the first and 21st centuries. Few scholars have more sharply or accessibly described the electric moment of the birth of what became Christianity, and the pained and incomplete process by which believers left Judaism behind. In books such as *[When Christians Were Jews: The First Generation](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780300248401)*; *[Paul: The Pagans’ Apostle](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780300240153)*; and *[Ancient Christianities: The First Five Hundred Years](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780691157696)*, and in scholarly work at Boston University and Hebrew University, Fredriksen sketches a startling portrait of this moment of spiritual eruption. Her readers find themselves in Jerusalem; Antioch, Turkey; or Damascus, Syria, as this new community burns with urgent faith, “racing on the edge of the end of time.”

Fredriksen, 74, was born in Rhode Island. Today she lives in Jerusalem, where I met her with the hope of better understanding the era that she studies and the one we all live in now. We sat in her quiet living room, that’s just a 20-minute drive from Golgotha.

Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

#### Wellesley College, 1969

**Matti Friedman**: How did you go from Rhode Island to the Mediterranean world of the first century CE?

**Paula Fredriksen**: I was lucky. The college I went to, Wellesley, had always had a Bible requirement for all students, but it had just been dropped when I got there—1969 was the season for doing that kind of thing. They always had Old Testament in the fall and New Testament in the spring for the whole college, but then they canceled it, much to the dismay not only of the Bible department but of the English department, the Art History department, and many others. You could no longer count on biblical literacy at all. So that meant that there was a large and fabulous department of teaching-oriented professors who suddenly didn’t have any students because everybody was doing Buddhism.

I was hooked. I was originally going to be a lawyer to save the world, and I changed my mind.

**MF**:I’m imagining you alone in a library, the shelves of Latin, Greek, and Bibles gathering dust, working in the ruins of the great tradition.

**PF**: Yes. I remember feeling glad that I didn’t feel crowded.

**MF**:Did you come with religion from home?

**PF**: I was raised a two-generation-removed Sicilian Roman Catholic. My grandmother came over from Sicily in the 1890s: Sebastiana Poliofitto Borelli. And my father was Norwegian, which explains why my name is Fredriksen. He was a-religious, though not anti-religious. My interest in the Bible didn’t come from there. I’d always been interested in religion.

When I was little, we’d visit my grandparents outside Boston in Lynn, Massachusetts. My grandfather, who wasn’t literate in English, had a book called *A Pictorial History of World War II*, and I would take the book and look at the photographs. I’d be hiding behind an armchair in the living room, as if I knew I wasn’t supposed to be looking at it. And that’s where I encountered pictures of the Holocaust. That was shocking to me—I mean, I just knew there was something fantastically wrong with that. That image was planted in my head.

“It’s still true that even with a more benign view of God, the problem of evil exists and is hardwired into monotheism. The moment you get rid of the evil forces, of all the other gods, you have only one God, and he’s in control—then why are things so bad?” —Paula Fredriksen

**MF**:Was that your first introduction to Jews?

**PF**: Yes. But I didn’t really configure it as Jews. I saw it as bad things happening to people—things that shouldn’t be happening. Later I read James Michener’s *The Source*. When the Six-Day War broke out in 1967, I read about it in *Life* magazine. And then there was the [terror attack](https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/munich-1972) at the Munich Olympics in 1972. These were points of punctuation, and steps on my own road to Zionism.

At Princeton, when I was doing graduate work, I was a happy, uncomplicated Marxist feminist atheist. It was the last time I had mental clarity on all these issues. I was working on my dissertation on Augustine’s early interpretations of Paul. I don’t know how well you know Augustine, but I find Augustine’s God really unattractive. Augustine’s God comes up with original sin and predestination. And there was this moment of liberation, when I realized that just because that was Augustine’s idea of God, that didn’t have to be my idea of God. And therefore, I decided, I would convert to Orthodox Judaism. \[Laughs.\] It made sense at the time.

At Stanford the following year, I studied with a rabbi who’d speak with me for several hours every Friday morning. He told me that people with advanced degrees in religion are usually too far gone for him to talk with. It was a master class. Later I studied with a rabbi in Berkeley.

But I always worked on ancient Christianity, and always at these two nodal points: When it’s being born out of Judaism in the time of the late Second Temple, and when it becomes an arm of the imperial government of Rome. I toggle between those two historical points.

It’s still true that even with a more benign view of God, the problem of evil exists and is hardwired into monotheism. The moment you get rid of the evil forces, of all the other gods, you have only one God, and he’s in control—then why are things so bad? That question becomes the crisis.

#### Jerusalem, First Century CE: Gods and Demons

**MF**: One startling thing I learned from your books is that although we think of Jews and Christians as monotheists, at first neither group was monotheistic at all—at least not in the way we understand that word. When did Jews and Christians get rid of other gods in favor of just one deity, creating this dilemma? When does that actually happen?

**PF**: It doesn’t actually happen—because the character of Satan always shows up, well-toned and ready to fight. He’s already around in Second Temple Judaism, and he’s an honorary personality in the Book of Job. But he becomes, by the Second Temple period, an active force of evil. People involved in magic are aware of the need to avoid him if you’re conjuring up lower spirits. Also, despite what we may think, and how we now understand monotheism, the pagan gods are very much alive for ancient Jews and Christians. For them, believing in a supreme god didn’t mean that there were not other, lesser gods. In the late Second Temple period, for some Jews, these gods come to be seen as evil demons.

**MF**:I learned from you that *demons* in Greek just meant “lower gods” in a neutral way, and then it takes on the negative connotation we now associate with the word. Was it Christians who gave it that connotation?

**PF**: In Paul’s writing, he’s already using the term *demons* negatively. For him, it’s these pagan gods who are the cosmic forces that Jesus, as the Davidic Messiah, must combat. There has to be a battle, or he’s not the Messiah. That’s part of the job description. So, for him, pagan gods become *daemonia* in the negative sense, and that calms the problem of how evil can exist in a world of one supreme deity. But then the question becomes: Why is God allowing this rebellion? Why is it still going on? Paul’s answer is because Jesus hasn’t come back yet.

As for Judaism, we have these [magic curse bowls](https://www.ancientjewreview.com/read/2024/10/29/review-manekin-bambergers-seder-mazikin-law-and-magic-in-late-antique-jewish-society#:~:text=The%20Babylonian%20incantation%20bowls%20represent,region%20of%20Nippur%20in%201913.) from Babylon, for example \[6th to 8th centuries\], made by Jews who clearly still believe in all kinds of spirits, conceived as gods. It’s a very congested cosmos.

**MF**:So when does that end in favor of our kind of monotheism? Does it even end? There are still people in this city, Jerusalem, who believe in active spirits.

**PF**: I don’t think it ever truly ends. There are different ethnically inflected types of magic right now; here in Israel, Yemenite magic is different from Moroccan magic. But *magic* is a very condescending word: What *I* do is religion; what *you* do is magic. But, yes, this very animated spirit world—I just repeated myself, because *anima*, of course, is “spirit” or “soul” in Latin—this is part of the world that many people still inhabit, maybe most people.

But these are no longer rival gods; they’re subordinate spirits. So the issue of power is settled: God is in charge, so it’s “monotheism.” But then the issue remains: Why is God allowing these other powers to operate?

#### Antioch, First Century CE: The Food Fight

**MF**:We often refer to this time as “early Christianity,” but as you explain so well in your books, that’s not how the first Christians understood what they were doing. They thought of themselves as Jews. Then some of the Jews who followed Jesus reached out to gentiles, and within a few generations of the death of Jesus, certainly within a century, there’s a turn against Jews that becomes increasingly vitriolic. And this turn, this resentment and anger at the earlier religion, is still with us in 2025. You can see it in press releases from Amnesty International about the evil of Israel, in college protests against the presumed influence of “Zionists,” in the growing evocation in pockets on the American religious right of Jewish anti-Christian manipulations.

**PF**: This turning starts early. If the Gospel of Mark is written shortly after the [destruction of the temple in 70 CE](https://www.britannica.com/event/Siege-of-Jerusalem-70), in that text you already have the priests inculpated for the death of Jesus. The destruction of the temple is explained by their involvement with the crucifixion. That’s still not exactly a condemnation of Judaism, but by the middle of the second century, many understand this to mean that “the” Jews killed Jesus. If you think of the different Christianities of this time as being radio frequencies, that idea is present in one of the radio frequencies. But these frequencies are also still contiguous with Judaism, and in these years, outsiders can still have a hard time distinguishing the two.

In fact, there’s now a movement within New Testament studies to look at the whole collection in the New Testament, a fourth-century collection which is made up of late first- and early second-century texts, as being not a new religion but essentially types of late Second Temple Judaism. This is an era with an energetic variety of forms of Jewishness. Do we think Mark was a Jew? Some people make that argument. But certainly Matthew was always considered a “Jewish” gospel. The Gospel of John is viciously anti-Jewish, and some argue that this is because John and his community were Jews who were kicked out of the “synagogue,” as if that were a single institution, which it wasn’t.

So there isn’t a “turn” against Judaism. Anti-Judaism is projected backward as these writings are read later. Already in the very earliest texts there’s a critique of Judaism—or rather an intra-Jewish critique that ultimately gets interpreted later, by others, as a condemnation of Judaism. But just as the criticisms of the Jerusalem priesthood in the Dead Sea Scrolls do not put the [Qumran community](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-dead-sea-sect) “outside of Judaism,” neither do these early texts, which become anti-Jewish only retrospectively.

**MF**:One of the most interesting parts of your book about Paul, *Paul: The Pagans’ Apostle*,is about the controversy among early believers over who’s allowed to eat with whom. Some Jews will eat with gentile Christ-followers, some won’t. The argument just seems so modern, one you can easily imagine in a current context. It seems almost like a social problem that becomes an ideological problem, one that’s still echoing in our own world, where we know there’s going to be a furious attempt over centuries to eradicate this particularist people with their strange laws and their unwillingness to fit in. The question isn’t really about dinner arrangements, but rather, does following Christ mean becoming a Jew? And what is a Jew?

**PF**: There’s tremendous urgency for these people in these questions. Think of it as a pressure cooker: It’s the first generation, and they’re expecting the Messiah to come back any day. It’s imminent. There’s a small historical window as far as they’re concerned, and an urgency about who’s right.

We only have fragments of the debate, those that survived and were later chosen for preservation. It’s hard to reconstruct precisely what was going on at the time. There’s this great debate that seems to be about circumcision, about conversion. There’s a debate in Antioch about social arrangements in this new community—about eating food that may have been consecrated to a pagan god, or in a house that contains idols. Which has to be an ongoing issue for everyone involved—I mean, by this time the Greek-speaking Jewish diaspora has been thriving for at least three centuries, since Alexander the Great died in 323 BCE. Diaspora Jews had long figured out how to get by.

These are Jewish questions long before the birth of this particular movement. What compromises do you make to live in your host society? Of course it’s familiar to us today. How committed were most Jews to the laws of kosher food then? How many are now? By whose interpretation? Jews in the land of Israel were going to Roman baths that displayed an idol of Aphrodite, as does [Rabban Gamliel in the baths of Akko](https://www.jtsa.edu/torah/avodah-zarah-34/), an episode related in [the Mishnah](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/mishnah/). Jews were naked in public with equally naked gentiles. Nothing is as clear as we want it to be.

In this scene from Paul’s letter, which is known in our business as the “food fight in Antioch,” the apostle Peter is also there: He’s particularly responsible for bringing Jews into the movement. And there’s Paul, who’s particularly responsible for bringing gentiles into the movement. What happens is that Peter initially eats with the ex-pagan gentiles, and then other Jews show up, envoys from James in Jerusalem, and Peter withdraws. This infuriates Paul.

Paul folds this episode into a larger, later argument about whether gentile members of this new movement need to be circumcised—that is, whether following Christ means becoming a Jew. Some of Paul’s colleagues say yes; he says no. My fellow scholar [Matthew Thiessen](https://stelida.mcmaster.ca/people/thiessen-matthew) puts it like this: In Paul’s view, the “circumcisers” are promoting cosmetic surgery, whereas he wants deep-gene therapy. Paul says circumcision is a matter for Jews, who have their own covenant with God. For gentiles, redemption comes through an infusion of Holy Spirit. Gentiles don’t have to worry about that fleshly stuff, he says, as you’ll all find out in the next 15 minutes, because Jesus is about to come back.

“I remember the poem by Andrew Marvell (1621–1678), the Metaphysical poet, ‘To His Coy Mistress,’ where he says, *Had we but world enough and time / This coyness, lady, were no crime.... And you should, if you please, refuse / Till the conversion of the Jews*.  
—Paula Fredriksen

**MF**:You have a beautiful phrase that appears in a few of your books—that this first generation of Christ-believers is “racing on the edge of the end of time.” They think the world is about to be redeemed. It’s so hard for us to imagine, knowing as we do that this religion will harden into enduring hierarchies and institutions. But they don’t think they’re this movement’s first generation. They think they’re the last generation.

**PF**: They were convinced that they knew the time on God’s clock. But that conviction isn’t limited to antiquity. The Pew Foundation in the United States [published a survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/03/26/us-christians-views-on-the-return-of-christ/#:~:text=Easter%20is%20one%20of%20the,will%20not%20happen%20\(28%25\).) in 2010 revealing that roughly 27 percent of American Christians believe that Jesus will “definitely” return by the year 2050. Another 20 percent believe that he will “probably” return. Paul would be surprised, I imagine, to see how long time has lasted, but he would certainly recognize and even resonate with the convictions of this 47 percent.

In the first century, these debates aren’t about the formation of a new religion, but about how to get organized for the imminent Second Coming of the Messiah. It’s only later that the character of Paul gets transformed into an anti-Jew who rejects the Torah not just for gentiles, but for everyone.

There’s the [letter to the Ephesians](https://ccel.org/bible/phillips/CP10Ephesians.htm) —probably from one or two generations after Paul, but written in his voice—saying that Christ came to get rid of Jewish law. This tells us that Paul’s already being read that way. And in the second century, the [Christian thinker Justin Martyr](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Justin-Martyr) speaks as a gentile who is completely outside Judaism. He conducts a famous argument against a Jew, Trypho, and tells him that Christians are the new Israel. But even Justin seems very familiar with the Greek text of the Hebrew Bible, and I’m not sure where he would have obtained those scrolls if not from a Jewish community, from a nearby synagogue. It’s not like there were bookshops at the time selling the Bible. So it’s possible that even someone like Justin once had a less fraught relationship with Jews.

#### Jerusalem, 2025: Anti-Jews

**MF**:There’s a recurring historical theme where spokesmen for newer faiths start out with a benign view of the Jews, with the idea that they’re going to be brought onside.It’s true of Martin Luther (1483–1546), and it’s true of Muhammad (570–632). And when the Jews aren’t interested, the backlash is vicious.Muhammad slaughters a Jewish tribe. Luther ends up calling Jews “poisoned, envenomed worms,” [and worse](https://exhibitions.library.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/martin-luther/judaism#:~:text=Luther's%20writings%20on%20Jews%20and,the%20Jews%E2%80%9D%20for%20writing%20it.).

**PF**: For these newer groups, since Judaism is the source, Jews provide the newer group’s authentication. If a Jew converts to your side, it proves you’re right. The idea surfaces in early stories about the discoveries of Christian relics: In these stories, it’s often a Jew who’s the one pointing out the way to the relics. And then there’s a happy ending: He converts once the relics are discovered. So Jews have an extra semiotic burden in this social world.

*Ecce Homo* by Mihály Munkácsy (1844–1900). The painting depicts the moment when Pontius Pilate presents a beaten and whipped Jesus to the crowd with the words Ecce Homo (Behold the man). Jesus has the crown of thorns on his head and a red or purple robe. (via Alamy)

**MF**:There seems to be a repeating phenomenon in which Jews come up with ideas or stories that other people adopt before turning on the originators—supposedly for a failure to understand their own ideas.What you recount seems like the prototype. It’s possible to argue that it happens not only with monotheism and the Bible, but with ideas like communism, maybe with psychoanalysis.The term *genocide* is coined by a Jew after World War II to describe something that happened to Jews, and has now been appropriated and [aimed back at Jews](https://www.thefp.com/p/another-reason-not-to-trust-the-experts).In the ancient paradigm you explore, the Jews are people who fail to grasp their own ideas—and this failure lies at the heart of problems afflicting the world.

**PF**: Right. There’s frustration. And in the ancient case there’s also urgency, because the end of the world is coming, so the Jews must convert. It’s pressing. It needs to happen for the scenario to keep playing out.

As a lapsed English major, I remember the poem by Andrew Marvell (1621–1678), the Metaphysical poet, “ [To His Coy Mistress](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44688/to-his-coy-mistress),” where he says, *Had we but world enough and time / This coyness, lady, were no crime.... And you should, if you please, refuse / Till the conversion of the Jews*. The idea becomes a hardwired part of the culture.

“Even though Paul will talk about the wrath of God that is coming, at the end, in his last letter to a community in Rome, he has this vision of universal peace. The full number of the gentiles and all of Israel will be redeemed from history.” —Paula Fredriksen

**MF**:One equivalent now would be that the prime barrier to the new era of human rights and Third-World ascendance is the racism and violence of the Jews, who are spoiling everything.

**PF**: The Gaza war has been universalized and polarized, morally.

**MF**:And the burning issue is not Hamas, or ideological currents among two billion Muslims, but the morality of seven million Israeli Jews.And it’s not just true for external observers but for many Jewish Israelis, who are primarily concerned not with an analysis of the vast world outside Israel but with the moral failings of their internal opponents. Anyone who reads your books finds this too.

**PF**: The Hebrew Bible, to its credit, is a warts-and-all portrait of the Jewish people. So a reader can focus on the warts. In one Jewish trope about themselves, the Jews are always stiff-necked, hard-hearted, belligerent, and not worshipping in the right way. That’s a Jewish critique of Jews, and it gets taken up by outsiders and used against Jews. The Bible can be a dangerous text, one that can be put to many different purposes. I’m not a scholar of Islam, but there, too, seems to be an unhappy improvisation off of recognizably Jewish sheet music.

**MF**:How do you understand an idea that we often hear repeated, that “Jesus was a Palestinian”? It’s made visually incarnate in photographs from Gaza obviously arranged to evoke [the Pietà](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pieta-iconography), or in a Vatican photograph last year that showed Pope Francis facing a nativity scene in which baby Jesus lies [atop a keffiyeh](https://www.timesofisrael.com/vatican-nativity-scene-showing-baby-jesus-on-a-keffiyeh-removed-after-backlash/).

**PF**: It’s obviously a form of cultural appropriation, because in current rhetoric, “Palestinian” is always opposed to “Jew.” I’ve even seen internet images of Jesus praying like a Muslim, with [Al-Aqsa](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Al-Aqsa-Mosque) at his back. The irony, of course, is that historically the political entity “Palestine” does not come into local play until the Romans are fed up with the Jews after the [Bar Kokhba Revolt](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bar-Kokhba-Revolt) (132–135). The name “Palestine” is imposed on Judea by a European colonizing power.

**MF**:On the surface, we seem to be living in a secular time. Maybe it’s been this way since you showed up at Wellesley College and found the Bible department empty. But in some ways it feels like we’re living in a deeply religious time, one that’s simply unaware of its religion, one in which people are enacting deep ideas whose origin they may not know. Do you think we’re likely to see a real [religious revival](https://www.thefp.com/p/watch-does-the-west-need-a-religious)?

**PF**: I think we’re living it right now. In the American scene, Trump is configured by evangelicals as someone who’s morally flawed, sure—but then again, so was King David. So it’s okay for us to have a convicted felon as president, because at least he acted against abortion. So that’s religiously configured right there. And here in Israel, we have \[Minister for National Security Itamar\] Ben-Gvir praying on the [Temple Mount](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israeli-ultranationalist-minister-faces-backlash-after-jerusalem-holy-site-visit) —not something that promotes world peace. Or \[Finance Minister Bezalel\] Smotrich trying to annex the West Bank. We call it fundamentalism, which implies a going backward, but it’s really a type of energy and absolute conviction. And I think we’re seeing a lot of it, which is why we’re having the kind of political confrontations that we are. I don’t know how it’s going to resolve. People have all these terrific weapons now.

**MF**:What’s the most beautiful thing that you’ve gleaned from your decades spent with Paul and the other incredible characters of the first generation we came to call Christians?

**PF**: The idea of God being intimately involved with what humans do. That humans make the wrong choices, but God chooses differently. Even though Paul will talk about the wrath of God that is coming, at the end, in his last letter to a community in Rome, he has this vision of universal peace. The full number of the gentiles and all of Israel will be redeemed from history. I think that’s a beautiful idea.
