What actually happened with Net Neutrality? Who predicted correctly?

Synthesized net neutrality outcomes and prediction accuracy

Let me search for the current state of net neutrality.

What's Next for Net Neutrality?

broadbandbreakfast.com

Good, I have a comprehensive picture. Let me summarize what happened and who predicted correctly.

Done

This is a fascinating case study in regulatory whiplash. Here's the full story and scorecard:

## What Actually Happened

Net neutrality has been on a long policy roller coaster:

**2015:** The Obama FCC established strong net neutrality rules, reclassifying broadband as a Title II "telecommunications service" (like a utility).

**2017:** The Trump FCC, led by Ajit Pai, repealed those rules, reclassifying broadband as a lighter-regulated Title I "information service."

**2024:** The Biden FCC voted 3–2 to reinstate net neutrality, once again reclassifying broadband under Title II.

**January 2025:** The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the FCC did not have legal authority to reinstate the landmark net neutrality rules. [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5247840/net-neutrality-fcc-struck) This effectively ended federal net neutrality. The court ruled that, under the statutory reading of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, internet service providers should be treated as Title I information services, which would require an act of Congress to change. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States)

The legal underpinning was the Supreme Court's 2024 *Loper Bright* decision, which ended "Chevron deference" — the doctrine that courts defer to federal agencies' interpretations of ambiguous statutes. Without that deference, the FCC's repeated flip-flopping on how to classify broadband was fatal to its case.

Because the FCC's 2024 order to reinstate net neutrality never became effective, the Sixth Circuit decision essentially preserved the status quo and did not change anything for consumers or businesses. [Perkins Coie](https://perkinscoie.com/insights/update/why-fccs-net-neutrality-rules-were-struck-down)

Despite the decision nixing federal oversight, tough net neutrality rules passed in California, Washington, Oregon, and other states still stand. [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5247840/net-neutrality-fcc-struck)

---

## Who Predicted Correctly?

**ISP opponents of net neutrality** were largely right on the legal trajectory — they argued the FCC lacked the authority to impose heavy-handed Title II regulation on broadband, and the courts eventually agreed.

**Ajit Pai** (the Trump FCC chairman who repealed it in 2017) argued that Title II classification was legally fragile, would chill investment, and that the internet was working fine without it. The legal fragility prediction proved accurate.

**Legal skeptics who warned about Chevron's future** were vindicated. Scholars had long argued that the FCC's regulatory ping-pong — flipping broadband classification with each new administration — was unsustainable and would eventually be struck down once Chevron deference weakened.

**Net neutrality advocates were wrong** about the apocalyptic predictions: the internet didn't collapse into paid fast lanes and blocked content during the 2017–2024 period without federal rules (though this remains contentious — critics argue abuse was just slow to materialize). They were also wrong that the legal strategy of Title II reclassification would hold up in court long-term.

**State-level advocates** were arguably the most prescient — those who pushed California and other states to pass their own net neutrality laws created a durable backstop that courts cannot easily strike down, since those are state legislative acts rather than federal agency rulemaking.

**The bottom line:** Those who warned the FCC's authority was built on shaky legal ground, dependent on Chevron deference that could be revoked, turned out to be correct. Blair Levin, former FCC chief of staff, assessed that "the odds of Congress acting" to codify net neutrality into federal law are "zero" [Broadband Breakfast](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/whats-next-for-net-neutrality/) — and with Republicans controlling both chambers and the White House hostile to broadband regulation, that prediction looks solid for the near future.

Did Congress come up with a permanent fix? Are there any bills pending?

9:09 AM

Searched for pending legislation but found no recent bills

Let me search for current status of net neutrality legislation in Congress.

Public Knowledge Urges Congress To Swiftly Move New Net Neutrality Bill Forward - Public Knowledge

publicknowledge.org

The search results show historical bills but not any specific 119th Congress net neutrality bills. The most recent item from Public Knowledge (December 2024) mentions that Congress will "soon introduce" a bill, but that seems to be referring to the end of the 118th Congress. I don't see evidence of any 119th Congress (2025-2026) net neutrality bills being introduced or passed. Let me give a clear summary of what I've found.

Done

Short answer: No permanent fix, and the legislative picture in the current 119th Congress (2025–2026) is bleak for net neutrality supporters.

Here's the state of play:

**No bill has passed.** Congress has never — in over 20 years of this debate — enacted a net neutrality law. Every attempt has stalled. To date, Congress has not passed legislation either mandating or prohibiting net neutrality, and no related legislation was introduced in the 118th Congress. [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12513)

**The recurring Democratic bills have always gone nowhere.** The pattern is very consistent: Democrats in the minority introduce a bill, it generates press, and it dies. The "Save the Internet Act" passed the Democratic House in 2019 but was never taken up in the Republican Senate. The "Net Neutrality and Broadband Justice Act" was introduced by Senators Markey and Wyden in 2022 with nearly 60 co-sponsors — all Democrats — and similarly went nowhere. These bills have been reintroduced in some form in nearly every Congress for a decade.

**The 119th Congress (the current one) is particularly hostile territory.** Republicans control both chambers and the White House. The new FCC Chairman, Brendan Carr, is an outspoken opponent of net neutrality who celebrated the Sixth Circuit ruling. There's no indication that any net neutrality legislation has been introduced in this Congress with any realistic chance of advancement, and former FCC chief of staff Blair Levin assessed the odds of Congress acting as essentially zero.

**What advocates are left with is a patchwork of state laws.** California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and about a dozen other states have their own net neutrality protections that remain legally intact. Your internet experience now depends on geography — in regulated states, you're more likely to have open, unbiased access; in others, ISPs may have more freedom to manage traffic and pricing. [BroadbandSearch](https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/net-neutrality)

The core political problem is that net neutrality has become almost entirely partisan. It consistently polls well across party lines with the public (often 70–80% support), but Republican lawmakers and the telecom industry are aligned against it, making any bipartisan Congressional fix essentially impossible under the current alignment. Unless control of Congress shifts or a bipartisan compromise emerges — perhaps trading some net neutrality rules for limits on FCC rate regulation, which some ISPs might accept — the federal landscape is likely to stay exactly where it is for the foreseeable future.

What materially do ISP providers in California and NY which is special in complaince with their state regulations?

NY State Senate Bill 2025-S3860

www.nysenate.gov

Now I have a clear picture. Let me also note an important distinction:

- **California (SB 822)**: This is *enacted law* - it's been in effect since 2018, upheld by courts, and ISPs operating in California must actually comply with it.
- **New York**: The situation is more complex. New York has NOT passed a comprehensive net neutrality law like California's. What New York has are repeated bills that have either passed one chamber or are still pending. The Assembly passed a bill in 2019, but the Senate hasn't enacted comprehensive net neutrality law. The NY bills are largely focused on *procurement* - requiring state agencies to only contract with ISPs that comply with net neutrality - rather than outright banning ISPs from non-neutral practices. There are multiple bills in the 2025-2026 session but none have been enacted.

I should make sure my answer clearly highlights this distinction so the user understands the actual legal status in each state.

Done

This is actually an important question to unpack carefully, because California and New York are in very different places — one has a real law on the books, and the other mostly has pending bills.

---

## California (SB 822) — Actually Enacted and Enforceable

California's law is the real deal. Signed in 2018, upheld by the Ninth Circuit in 2022, and fully in force. SB 822 is even more stringent than the federal net neutrality rule that was eliminated by the Trump FCC [CCMI](https://www.ccmi.com/ninth-circuit-upholds-california-net-neutrality-law/), and what ISPs must materially do differently includes:

**No blocking or throttling.** Under SB 822, it is unlawful for an ISP to block lawful content or impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic based on content, with an exception for reasonable network management. The law also prohibits paid prioritization — when an ISP charges a fee to favor some data traffic over other traffic. Further, SB 822 prohibits ISPs from charging edge providers "access fees" to reach customers. [NatLawReview](https://natlawreview.com/article/california-adopts-net-neutrality-law-court-hearing-scheduled-nov-14)

**Stricter zero-rating rules than the old federal standard.** This is where California goes further than the 2015 Obama-era rules did. SB 822 goes beyond the Obama-era rules by prohibiting ISPs from engaging in discriminatory zero-rating of some content within a category of Internet content. "Zero-rating" refers to the practice of not counting certain content against a plan's data cap. [NatLawReview](https://natlawreview.com/article/california-adopts-net-neutrality-law-court-hearing-scheduled-nov-14) So an ISP can't exempt its own video service from your data cap while counting competitors' streaming against it.

**No interconnection manipulation.** SB 822 ensures that ISPs can't evade net neutrality at the point where data enters their network. This closes a loophole large ISPs abused from 2013–15, when they slowed down sites and services for tens of millions of Americans who had paid for fast broadband connections. [Stanford CIS](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2018/09/gov-jerry-brown-signs-sb-822-restoring-net-neutrality-california/)

**Real-world impact:** The law has already forced behavior changes. When AT&T eliminated its regressive data capping policy on HBO Max in compliance with California's net neutrality law, it did so across its entire network — to the benefit of low-income users in the remaining 49 states. [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/01/california-prevails-net-neutrality-and-states-can-go-forth) This is the "California effect" — because ISPs often can't run two completely separate network configurations cost-effectively, California's rules sometimes pull national behavior in a more neutral direction.

---

## New York — Much Weaker Position Than Most People Realize

This is where expectations often exceed reality. Despite lots of legislative activity, New York does **not** have a broad, California-style net neutrality law currently in force.

What New York has attempted — repeatedly — is a narrower, procurement-based approach. Bills in the NY legislature would require that New York State agencies, public authorities, municipalities, municipal corporations, and libraries only contract with ISPs certified by the Public Service Commission to follow net neutrality principles, using New York's buying power as a large consumer of Internet services to encourage ISPs to abide by net-neutrality principles. [New York State Senate](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1545)

The NY Assembly passed a version of this bill in 2019, but the Senate never enacted it. Multiple versions have been reintroduced in the current 2025–2026 session — including S1545, S2524, S3860, and S6066 — all still sitting in committee. The legislation would mandate that state and municipal agencies cannot purchase internet services from providers who violate net neutrality principles, effectively creating strong economic incentives for compliance. [BillTrack50](https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1810897)

One bill (S3860) goes further and would give the NY Public Service Commission and the Attorney General direct enforcement authority over ISPs, mirroring California's approach more closely. But as of now, none of these have been signed into law.

---

## The Bottom Line

If you're an ISP operating in both states today, California imposes hard, legally enforceable rules on your network management practices — no blocking, no throttling, no discriminatory zero-rating, no paid fast lanes. New York currently relies primarily on political pressure and has no comparable enacted statute. The practical compliance burden for ISPs is almost entirely California-driven, which is one reason the California law punches above its weight nationally.

What actions, if any, in violation of these particular state regulations have been brought? What is the net differential in pricing for ISP services in these two states vs those with the looser regulations?

Mapped: The U.S. States Overpaying For An Internet Connection

www.visualcapitalist.com

Now I have enough data to give a thorough, accurate answer. Let me synthesize the findings:

1. Enforcement actions: The legal activity has been almost entirely *defensive* - ISPs suing California to block SB 822, not the state suing ISPs for violations. I found no evidence of the California AG or any other authority bringing affirmative enforcement actions against ISPs for SB 822 violations. The AT&T/HBO Max data cap situation was voluntary compliance, not the result of an enforcement action.
2. Pricing: California and New York have among the best per-Mbps prices in the country (CA at $0.04/Mbps, NY at $0.10/Mbps).

But I need to be careful about attribution here—the pricing advantage correlates more strongly with population density and market competition than with net neutrality laws themselves. Texas shows similarly competitive rates at $0.12/Mbps without any net neutrality protections, which complicates the picture.

Done

These are two distinct questions with quite different answers, so let me address each directly.

## Enforcement Actions: The Honest Answer Is — Almost None

Despite SB 822 being fully in force in California since early 2021, there have been no publicly reported affirmative enforcement actions brought by the California Attorney General against an ISP for violating SB 822's substantive net neutrality provisions. The entire legal saga has run almost entirely in the opposite direction — it was the ISPs suing California, not California suing ISPs.

The timeline is telling. On May 4, 2022, the trade associations for the nation's largest wireless, phone, and cable companies — including ACA Connects, CTIA, NCTA, and USTelecom — agreed to voluntarily dismiss their lawsuit challenging SB 822, following three consecutive losses in federal court. [Stanford Law School](https://law.stanford.edu/2022/05/05/isps-drop-legal-fight-against-california-net-neutrality-law/) The ISP industry spent four years trying to kill the law rather than comply with it, and when they finally gave up, compliance appears to have largely followed without formal enforcement proceedings.

The one concrete behavioral change that can be linked to SB 822 was AT&T's zero-rating policy on HBO Max. When AT&T eliminated its regressive data capping policy on HBO Max in compliance with California's net neutrality law, it did so across its entire network — to the benefit of low-income users in the remaining 49 states. [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/01/california-prevails-net-neutrality-and-states-can-go-forth) But that was voluntary compliance, not the outcome of a lawsuit or penalty.

New York has no enacted net neutrality law producing enforceable obligations on ISPs, so the question of enforcement there is moot — there's nothing to enforce.

Why so little enforcement in California? A few plausible explanations: ISPs may be largely complying to avoid being the first high-profile defendant under the law; the violations that do occur (throttling, selective zero-rating) are technically difficult to detect and prove; and the AG's office may be saving its resources for a large test case rather than smaller skirmishes. The law is real and enforceable, but it has functioned more as a deterrent than an active enforcement mechanism so far.

## Pricing: California and New York Are Actually Among the Cheapest — But the Reason Is Complicated

Here's where the data gets interesting, and where causation is very hard to attribute to net neutrality laws specifically.

Californians pay an average of 4 cents per Mbps and New Yorkers about 10 cents for fiber-optic service. The comparable figures for Maryland and Massachusetts are 55 cents per Mbps, rising to $1.20 in Arizona and $2 in New Hampshire. [Milken Institute Review](https://www.milkenreview.org/articles/the-scandalous-cost-of-internet-in-america)

So on a per-Mbps basis, California and New York are genuinely among the cheapest states in the country. The lowest cost-per-Mbps rankings put California first at $0.04 per Mbps and New York third at $0.10 per Mbps. [HomeLink](https://www.homelinkd.com/blog/breakdown-of-internet-rates-by-state)

But here's the critical caveat: the primary driver of this pricing advantage almost certainly isn't net neutrality law — it's **competition and population density**. With four major ISPs, New York and Los Angeles have relatively competitive markets, and relatively low internet prices. [Milken Institute Review](https://www.milkenreview.org/articles/the-scandalous-cost-of-internet-in-america) Compare that with rural states or monopoly-ISP markets where "prices are high simply because I can," as one rural ISP executive put it to a former FCC chair.

States without net neutrality laws like Texas also rank well on cost per Mbps in some analyses — Texas's large urban centers (Houston, Dallas, Austin) drive competitive pricing that has nothing to do with regulatory environment.

On absolute monthly bill amounts, a 2024 survey of the five most populous states — California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania — found that the average internet bill had increased from $81 at sign-up to $98 today [Broadband Breakfast](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/survey-rising-internet-bills-add-to-consumer-frustration-amid-inflation/), which suggests all five states (regulated and unregulated alike) have experienced the same broad price drift upward. No material differential was found between California/New York and the others in that survey.

**The bottom line on pricing:** California and New York consumers do get relatively good value per Mbps, but you cannot cleanly credit SB 822 for that. The bigger structural factors are urban density, ISP competition, and infrastructure investment. Net neutrality law plausibly prevents ISPs from extracting *additional* revenue through paid fast lanes or discriminatory zero-rating schemes, but isolating that effect from the raw cost data is essentially impossible with current public information. The honest answer is that researchers have not established a clean causal link between net neutrality regulation at the state level and lower broadband prices.
