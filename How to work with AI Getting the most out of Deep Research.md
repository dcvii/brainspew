The release of ChatGPT Deep Research was a huge ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù for me. As a non-engineer, it was the first time that AI automated something end-to-end that was core to my job and that I was good at.

Instead of spending hours doing manual Google searches and compiling the results, I could now get a 20-page report in minutes. Mind-blowing.

But as always with AI, once I got over the initial excitement, I realized that the results were often pretty rough around the edges. Questionable sources, shaky methodology, barely formatted walls-of-text ‚Äî you name it, I‚Äôve seen it in a Deep Research report.

The potential was clearly there, but it didn‚Äôt seem like the promise of a ‚ÄúMcKinsey analyst on demand‚Äù was entirely accurate. At least not without putting in the work to understand and address the weaknesses of the tool.

As I was going through this learning process, I was looking for guides online. But I was surprised to find that most of them were way too generic to be actionable.

**So I decided to write the ultimate guide to AI research agents myself.**

No hype ‚Äî just my hard-earned lessons on what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and how to get the best possible output. Including actual side-by-side examples so you can see the impact of the best practices I‚Äôm proposing.

**We‚Äôll cover:**

- How I think about the **core use cases** as well as **limitations** of DeepResearch
- **Which AI research tool is best** for what task (incl. cheaper alternatives to the $200 ChatGPT Pro plan)
- How to write **effective prompts** that give top-tier output every time
- How to get the **most value** out of the final report

And if you‚Äôve been following the Operator‚Äôs Handbook for a while, you know it‚Äôll be detailed. So grab a coffee and let‚Äôs dive in ‚òï.

*P.S. This is the first part in a new series about how to get **actual work** done with AI; in the same in-depth, tactical style as other Operator‚Äôs Handbook posts. If you have topics you‚Äôd like me to write about, [let me know](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/).*

## How I think about AI tools for research

AI research agents are incredibly useful ‚Äî regardless of your job. ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù might sound like something that‚Äôs mostly relevant in academia or certain entry-level roles; but once you look closely, I bet you‚Äôll find that you spend **a lot** of time on this.

For example:

- As a *Product Manager*, you‚Äôre researching competitors‚Äô products
- As a *Founder*, you‚Äôre learning about sales tax, payroll, or cap table math
- And if you‚Äôre in *BizOps*, your entire job is basically to ramp up ASAP on a new topic every week so you can make an impact and move on to the next thing

AI research agents can help with all of that and more. And they‚Äôre not just useful on the job.

Based on my experience, the high-level use cases are:

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/01bd48e0-0922-49f3-8f91-65e01a061b1c_1831x845.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:672,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:424743,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01bd48e0-0922-49f3-8f91-65e01a061b1c_1831x845.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

AI can reduce the time required to do these things by 80% - 90%. **But: Do not completely outsource these tasks without oversight.** If you blindly use the output for anything important, you‚Äôre guaranteed to have a bad time.

These AI agents, at least in their current versions, need serious handholding to produce something robust. And to play the role of the critical ‚Äúmanager‚Äù, you need to know what to watch out for.

Here are the five biggest issues to be aware of:

## Issue #1: AI agents don‚Äôt ask for the context they need

As you‚Äôll see in the detailed comparison below, most AI research tools don‚Äôt proactively ask for context and only use the information you provide in the prompt.

Like an overeager analyst, they jump straight into execution, even if they have no idea what you‚Äôre actually trying to do with the report.

And even if the agents do ask for context (e.g. because you told them to):

1. The questions don‚Äôt always cover all important aspects, and
2. They never follow up if your answers are insufficient

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U55v!)

**üëâ What to do about this:** Proactively provide as much context as possible about your situation and what you‚Äôre trying to achieve, and tell the agent to ask for anything that‚Äôs still missing

## Issue #2: AI agents don‚Äôt know how to handle sources properly

I‚Äôve observed a few major issues with how AI agents deal with sources by default (i.e. unless you tell them how to do better):

- ‚òù **Over-reliance** on individual sources, resulting in biased assessments or tunnel vision
- üß© **Mixing and matching** data sources without highlighting caveats, creating a patchwork analysis that doesn‚Äôt make sense
- üóëÔ∏è Use of **low-quality sources** (e.g. random Reddit posts from anonymous users)
- üìÜ **Outdated** sources (e.g. data from 5 - 10 years ago even in areas where things are changing fast)

If you don‚Äôt watch out, you‚Äôll end up with a fancy-looking report on a shaky foundation:

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/42a06d22-d8e7-483f-98d0-eeea8b26bf3a_770x978.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:978,%22width%22:770,%22resizeWidth%22:455,%22bytes%22:163140,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42a06d22-d8e7-483f-98d0-eeea8b26bf3a_770x978.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

**üëâ What to do about this:** Especially for data-heavy reports, you have to 1) provide guidance on what sources to prioritize and 2) request visibility into *how* sources were used.

## Issue #3: AI agents lack access to a lot of high-quality data sources

Deep Research cannot access **paid sources**. However, depending on your area of research, that‚Äôs where a lot of the good data sits.

For example, for a lot of analyses in B2B SaaS, you might want to leverage data from LinkedIn‚Äôs API or market research firms. Right now, to do this, you‚Äôll need to first download those datasets and then make them accessible to the AI.

In addition, AI agents can obviously only research what‚Äôs available online. If you‚Äôre looking into a nuanced, niche topic (e.g. a complicated legal matter), that‚Äôs a problem.

**üëâ What to do about this:** In these cases, it‚Äôs best to treat Deep Research as a tool that can help you **prepare for expert calls** (so you know what questions to ask) rather than an end-to-end solution to give you a recommendation.

## Issue #4: AI agents sometimes show mediocre judgment

The quality of reasoning in DeepResearch reports varies **a lot**; both between different queries as well as different tools (e.g. ChatGPT vs. Gemini). Sometimes I‚Äôm deeply impressed, and other times I feel like I‚Äôm reviewing the work of a high school intern.

In addition, you‚Äôll find that the research agents often just rehash an opinion they found (e.g. in a blog post) instead of really *thinking through* an issue. In other words, you‚Äôre outsourcing judgment to a random person online.

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/516400f7-669d-49a3-924d-df7c9c81ca4b_522x851.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:851,%22width%22:522,%22resizeWidth%22:360,%22bytes%22:164833,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F516400f7-669d-49a3-924d-df7c9c81ca4b_522x851.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

**üëâ What to do about this:**

- Most importantly, pick the most capable tool (more on that below)
- Make sure you review the research plan in advance and provide detailed instructions re: methodology
- Give critical feedback on the first draft to address any glaring issues (even if it makes mistakes, AI always has a good attitude and is happy to fix things)

## Issue #5: The default output format is often not very helpful

By default, the research reports you get from ChatGPT and Gemini are massive walls-of-text that are difficult to make sense of.

Sure, you can get an AI summary; but in some cases, you ***do*** want to go deep. You just want information presented in a way that makes it easy to digest.

**üëâ What to do about this:** Give instructions on how you want the report to be structured and formatted (e.g. adding a ‚ÄúTL;DR‚Äù, using overview tables etc.).

Alright, enough complaining; let‚Äôs talk about specific things you can do to get the most out of these tools.

1. First, we‚Äôll dig deeper into the different tools and their strengths and weaknesses so you know which one is the best fit for your use case
2. Then, we‚Äôll go through actionable best practices you can use to get **high-quality outputs every single time**

## Which AI research tool is best?

You‚Äôve probably heard of [ChatGPT Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/), but it isn‚Äôt the only tool out there. Tons of other players released their own versions in the last few months.

The big ones are:

- [Gemini Deep Research](https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/)
- [Perplexity Research](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research)
- [Grok DeepSearch](https://x.ai/news/grok-3)
- [Claude Research](https://www.anthropic.com/news/research)

At first glance, they‚Äôre pretty similar. You drop a research prompt into a chat window, and 5 to 30 minutes later you get a detailed multi-page report.

However, the devil is in the details. I‚Äôve tested these tools extensively over dozens of use cases, and there are ***massive*** differences in how they approach research and the quality of the outputs:

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02fb63f0-846e-408b-928d-546679e97f93_1500x1190.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:1155,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:411004,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02fb63f0-846e-408b-928d-546679e97f93_1500x1190.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

***Note**: I‚Äôm comparing the basic version of the models here so you know what you‚Äôll get as a free user. I‚Äôll cover the performance differences of the premium ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù models in a separate section at the end.*

## ‚≠ê Overall recommendation

**TL;DR:**

- **ChatGPT Deep Research** is still overall the best tool for truly ***deep*** research out there; no other tool comes close to the depth and rigor at the moment
- **Perplexity** is great for brief, well-structured overviews on new topics

ChatGPT‚Äôs two biggest weaknesses are 1) how it selects sources and 2) that it creates massive walls-of-text with poor formatting.

Both of these are **default behavior, though, that can be adjusted** with the right prompts; we‚Äôll get into that in the next section. In my experience, it boils down to this:

> *You can ask ChatGPT to use different sources or make the report pretty, but you can‚Äôt really prompt the other tools to be much more **rigorous.***

However, the $200 Pro tier is ridiculously expensive for individuals, and the free and Plus tiers have low usage limits. As a result, you might want to choose another tool as your ‚Äúdaily driver‚Äù based on the pros and cons discussed here and ‚Äúsave‚Äù ChatGPT Deep Research for your most important tasks.

## üí∞ Pricing & limits

**üèÜ Winner: Grok; ü•à Runner-up: Perplexity**

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e2dbf1b7-8cde-49aa-86da-22e0f1fa588d_2183x593.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:396,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:246166,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2dbf1b7-8cde-49aa-86da-22e0f1fa588d_2183x593.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

Grok and Perplexity both have generous free tiers with multiple queries ***per day***, making them the clear favorite for anyone trying to get Deep Research without a subscription.

In contrast, the free tiers of ChatGPT and Gemini have fairly restrictive limits ***per month***, and Claude doesn‚Äôt have Research in the free tier at all.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yauW!)

If only Claude Research were good enough to justify being this confident

As a heavy user, you‚Äôll eventually face the question of whether you should upgrade to a premium tier. In addition to **much** higher usage limits, you supposedly also get access to better models and higher-quality outputs.

We‚Äôll discuss towards the end of this section whether that makes a noticeable difference or not (**spoiler**: not really).

## ü§î Research planning

**üèÜ Winner: Gemini; ü•à Runner-up: ChatGPT**

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8e146259-ff35-4bcb-97c6-71fbd28ab347_2183x435.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:290,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:184857,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e146259-ff35-4bcb-97c6-71fbd28ab347_2183x435.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

Especially if you don‚Äôt write a lengthy prompt with detailed instructions on how you want the agent to conduct the research, it‚Äôs key to understand what it plans to do before it starts.

For example, if you‚Äôre asking for a comparison of software tools, you might want to understand what criteria it plans to use to evaluate them so you don‚Äôt have to wait 5 - 10 minutes to get something that misses the mark.

**Gemini is the only tool that shares its research plan by default.** Among the others, ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity usually provide one on request:

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f895e63-2cb6-4bf7-a204-76caad333da9_552x69.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:69,%22width%22:552,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:13091,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f895e63-2cb6-4bf7-a204-76caad333da9_552x69.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

Grok, on the other hand, tends to ignore my requests and just proceeds with the research ü§∑.

**Note:** To maximize the odds that the agent shares the research plan, ask for it both 1) in the initial prompt as well as 2) when answering follow-up questions.

## üôã‚ôÇÔ∏è Context gathering

**üèÜ Winner: ChatGPT; ü•à Runner-up: Claude**

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f8b52e5-bcae-4283-a72b-5b3385afad5d_2273x429.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:275,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:196414,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8b52e5-bcae-4283-a72b-5b3385afad5d_2273x429.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

ChatGPT Deep Research is the only tool that reliably asks 3 - 5 questions for context, even when you don‚Äôt tell it explicitly to do that. Plus, the questions are usually on point (i.e. similar to what a strong analyst would ask).

The others do it when you ask them to in the prompt, although not reliably. Here are two things that have worked well for me:

- With Gemini, *repeat your request* to ask for missing context after the agent shares the research plan
- With Grok, include a request in your prompt to *explain how \[XYZ\] applies to \[my situation / my company\].* It‚Äôll then sometimes realize it needs additional information to do that

## üß† Reasoning & judgment

**üèÜ Winner: ChatGPT; ü•à Runner-up: Perplexity**

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/99e9d762-dde6-41e9-a8c7-8c4197002ad5_2097x759.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:527,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:295070,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99e9d762-dde6-41e9-a8c7-8c4197002ad5_2097x759.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

Reasoning and judgment are the foundation of a good research report.

If you don‚Äôt agree with the methodology the agent used or the conclusions it arrived at, it doesn‚Äôt matter how long or pretty the report is.

**ChatGPT is the clear winner here**; not only does it show strong judgment (e.g. when choosing evaluation criteria or deriving takeaways), it also gives strong recommendations with clear reasoning for how it arrived at that opinion.

All of the other tools (except Perplexity) regularly make questionable choices in their research approach, and it‚Äôs often unclear how they arrived at their recommendations. As a result, you have to read the reports very carefully and ask follow-up questions if you plan on using the output for anything important.

## üìñ Comprehensiveness

**üèÜ Winner: ChatGPT; ü•à Runner-up: Gemini**

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d529149f-9404-434a-b2f8-25dab8a5a7f1_2129x478.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:327,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:210563,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd529149f-9404-434a-b2f8-25dab8a5a7f1_2129x478.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

ChatGPT and Gemini produce by far the most comprehensive reports; however, while ChatGPT typically goes deep on the *important areas*, Gemini often adds generic ‚Äúfluff‚Äù that wasn‚Äôt requested in the prompt.

The obvious upside of ChatGPT‚Äôs massive reports is that you get much more detailed considerations for complex topics than with the other tools.

But it also means that you need to **add instructions to improve the report structure** **and formatting** (e.g. by adding summaries for each section), and/or get an AI summary for these reports if you need insights quickly. We‚Äôll dig more into that below.

The other three tools suffer from the opposite problem; their reports aren‚Äôt really *deep* research. Even if they consider dozens (or in the case of Claude, hundreds) of sources, the output reads like a ‚ÄúTL;DR‚Äù, so don‚Äôt expect a lot of nuance, detailed comparisons or super tactical guides.

You **can** get somewhat more detailed reports by asking them to be ‚Äú *extra thorough* ‚Äù and ‚Äú *aim for at least \[X thousand\] words* ‚Äù (esp. from Perplexity), but it won‚Äôt reach ChatGPT levels.

Perplexity and Grok both produce easy-to-read reports by default that make good use of bulleted lists and overview tables. If you‚Äôre looking for quick, well-formatted insights without having to tweak your prompt, these are the tools for you.

As mentioned before, the other tools need guidance in the prompt to produce something that‚Äôs easy to parse.

## üìö Sources

**üèÜ Winner: Perplexity; ü•à Runner-up: Claude**

There are a few things that matter when it comes to sources for DeepResearch:

1. Whether it‚Äôs easy to select **what (kind of) sources to prioritize**
2. **How many** sources are being considered (to get a balanced overview that incorporates a wide range of opinions and data points)
3. The **quality of the sources** that the research agent selects
4. How easy it is to trace **citations** (so you can double-check the data behind arguments)

ChatGPT isn‚Äôt great at any of these (besides citations) by default. That‚Äôs not a massive problem in practice, though, since 1) its summaries and takeaways are often still on point and 2) it‚Äôs very responsive to feedback.

For example, when I asked for a market size overview of major EU markets, the first version used questionable methodology and data sources. But I was able to get a **much better version** in 5 minutes by doing two things:

1. Asking ChatGPT o3 to compile a list of the best data sources for market size estimation:

1. Asking Deep Research to re-do that part of the report based on this, and **highlight where numbers from different reputable sources don‚Äôt align** (+ provide hypotheses for why that could be).

## Are the premium versions worth it?

After playing around with Deep Research for a bit, you might be wondering: Are the expensive premium versions worth it, or is the free tier enough?

Don‚Äôt worry; I bought all of them so you don‚Äôt have to.

**TL;DR:** In my view, only the ChatGPT premium version is worth it if you‚Äôre a heavy user. All of the other ones only make sense if you‚Äôre using the account for other things as well.

There are two main considerations here:

### 1\. Request limits

Perplexity and Grok provide plenty of research credits in the free versions, so upgrading isn‚Äôt necessary for most users.

Heavy users of Gemini will likely hit a limit, and Claude doesn‚Äôt offer the Research feature for free at all; but in my view, you‚Äôre better off going with ChatGPT in that case.

### 2\. Quality of outputs

In the ads for the premium tiers, you‚Äôll see some pretty lofty claims around advanced reasoning, more in-depth research, or more sources / citations.

**But is there actually a noticeable difference in practice?**

In short: No.

- Reports from **Perplexity Pro** seem fairly similar to those of the free tier; I definitely didn‚Äôt get the advertised ‚Äú10x more citations‚Äù. The main difference I noticed was that it produced a lot of fancy charts that weren‚Äôt actually that helpful
- Grok **DeeperSearch** also didn‚Äôt impress me. I ran the exact same queries on both models to do an apples-to-apples comparison; DeeperSearch did use about 2-3x more sources and in some cases produced a 30% - 60% longer report with added detail, but it got nowhere close to the depth of ChatGPT Deep Research

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32450429-c857-4717-89b2-d036114f49c5_950x875.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:875,%22width%22:950,%22resizeWidth%22:375,%22bytes%22:1294757,%22alt%22:%22%22,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32450429-c857-4717-89b2-d036114f49c5_950x875.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

Let‚Äôs argue on the internet!

> Even the premium versions still feel like ***summaries,*** while ChatGPT produces actually ***deep research*** that walks you through a topic exhaustively.

## How to create a good Deep Research prompt

The quality of your prompt makes or breaks your research effort. If you submit a careless request, you‚Äôll be waiting up to 15 minutes (or longer) only to discover that the half-baked mess you got back is unusable and you wasted precious Deep Research credits.

While each model has its quirks, the core structure of what makes a good Deep Research prompt is somewhat independent of which tool you end up using.

We‚Äôll first go through the individual components, and then put it all together. Feel free to skip ahead if you want to get started ASAP.

---

## Step 1: Clearly state your goal

What is the objective of your research effort, and what output do you want? As mentioned above, this could be an overview, a recommendation, a comparison, or a detailed step-by-step guide (or a mix of these).

- ‚ùå ‚ÄúHelp me understand how SEO for AI search works‚Äù
- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúPlease briefly summarize SEO best practices for AI search engines, provide a checklist of concrete steps I can take to boost visibility of my content, and recommend a specific tool that can help me with this‚Äù

## Step 2: Provide context

This step requires the most effort from you, but it‚Äôs also the most important. The magic of Deep Research isn‚Äôt that you get a 20-page summary of a topic ‚Äî it‚Äôs that you can get a report *customized to your situation* as if you had a research analyst on your team.

**Remember:** For any bit of context that you leave out, the AI will just make an assumption or keep it generic so it applies to everyone.

What‚Äôs important depends on the situation, but you might want to include:

- üíº Basic **facts about your business** or situation (e.g. product, business model, geography)
- üôã‚ôÇÔ∏è Who the **audience** of the report is (e.g. you, the CFO of your company etc.) and what their level of familiarity with the topic is
- üöß What **constraints** you‚Äôre facing (e.g. things your company can‚Äôt / won‚Äôt consider)
- üéØ What the **downstream use** of the report is (e.g. a specific decision you‚Äôre hoping to make)

Even basic context makes a **massive** difference:

- This is the super [generic report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lQfX4mKBm18lICoL2kfxPv7GxT56r1pRO5MSy0aJmnU/edit?usp=sharing) Gemini created about VAT regulations and compliance *without any context*
- This is the much more [concrete, actionable report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dHK4L7nRL4Z7AD6GGQ8tWubW7YqT3-x-r_jZxFgfwSc/edit?usp=sharing) thanks to one sentence of added context in the prompt (B2B SaaS startup from the US expanding to the EU)

Since it can be difficult to think of everything that might be relevant, you can ask AI to help you brainstorm. A simple prompt that has worked well for me (e.g. with O3) is:

> *I'm planning to generate a Deep Research report on \[X\] in order to \[Y\]. What context should I provide so that I get a customized, actionable report? Pretend you have no context from any prior conversations.*

Lastly, if you want to be sure you didn‚Äôt miss anything, ask the Deep Research agent directly to get additional context from you:

## Step 3: Specify what you want the output to look like

As mentioned before, the default output (esp. of ChatGPT) is a bit of a mess. If you want something that is easier to digest, you‚Äôll have to specify that.

Some things that have worked well for me include:

### Specify the content and structure of the document

Being explicit about the content and structure of 1) the overall document and 2) individual sections made a massive difference for me.

**For example:**

- Dictate any key things you want included in the deliverable (e.g. a specific comparison, templates, copy examples, code snippets etc.)
- Ask the agent to follow the Pyramid Principle and lead with the key takeaways or recommendations (both in the main summary and in each individual sub-section)

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/57c72179-b20d-4436-b653-67d52c45be10_795x340.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:340,%22width%22:795,%22resizeWidth%22:641,%22bytes%22:82184,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57c72179-b20d-4436-b653-67d52c45be10_795x340.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

Example from a ChatGPT Deep Research report on vibe coding tools. Before asking for this, I had to search for the recommendations like a needle in a haystack

- Ask for an overview of the sources used, incl. what they were used for, their type (e.g. government vs. commercial vs. news outlet vs. newsletter / blog), the date they were created or updated etc.

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cba2171e-64c0-4ea2-b961-5ce59462ea20_563x267.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:267,%22width%22:563,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:46183,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcba2171e-64c0-4ea2-b961-5ce59462ea20_563x267.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

### Specify the desired format of the output

Just adding a few basic instructions to the prompt makes a massive difference in how the report looks.

- Ask to use bulleted lists and bolded text where appropriate
- State that you prefer tables over text summaries for any sort of comparison or overview

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6669a0eb-be92-4d49-8522-66b60995077f_1500x1089.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:1057,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:723841,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6669a0eb-be92-4d49-8522-66b60995077f_1500x1089.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

## Step 4: Ask for the research plan and provide feedback

As you saw in the overview above, only Gemini reliably shares a research plan proactively. To prevent negative surprises, remember to ask for it before the agent kicks off any work.

For example, [this is the proposed research plan I got from ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/s/dr_6855884431cc8191a3fdaa5cfc1eb4fd) for a deep dive into vibe coding tools after *explicitly asking for it.*

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f460583-895c-437b-965e-919d3f328a27_758x495.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:495,%22width%22:758,%22resizeWidth%22:552,%22bytes%22:82826,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f460583-895c-437b-965e-919d3f328a27_758x495.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

Snippet from research plan from ChatGPT; click here for the full thing

Here are the key things I‚Äôd watch out for:

- Is the research plan **comprehensive**? Is there any analysis you want the agent to do, or a section you want them to write up, that‚Äôs missing?
- Do you like where the agent is **focusing**? If you have a particular area you‚Äôre interested in, make sure the agent is building its report around that
- Are there any implicit or explicit **assumptions** that you disagree with? If so, provide relevant context to plug those gaps
- Do you agree with the **methodology** (e.g. evaluation or comparison criteria)?

This is also a good time to specify if you want the agent to prioritize certain **sources.**

For example, you could ask to use data from independent third parties rather than company websites, or that you want only data that‚Äôs more recent than a certain cut-off date.

---

## Optional: Give examples of what you want

If you have specific expectations (e.g. for what the output should look like), it can be helpful to give examples.

For example, you might be using Deep Research to automate the creation of reports you used to do manually. In that case, drop some best-in-class samples of your work into a document and upload it as context so that the AI agent can imitate them.

---

## Putting it all together: What an effective Deep Research prompt looks like

Here‚Äôs an example of an end-to-end prompt that incorporates the tips from above:

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39f02e0c-2be3-4594-b403-ac2e2b9c0f67_1500x1190.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:1155,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:837484,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f02e0c-2be3-4594-b403-ac2e2b9c0f67_1500x1190.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

And here is what ChatGPT produced:

- [Account scoring guide](https://chatgpt.com/share/6859a8d6-715c-8002-9afa-f3174f0a4b72)

Pretty good, I‚Äôd say ‚Äî and much better than what you would have gotten with a simple ‚Äúcreate an account scoring guide‚Äù prompt.

***Side note***: *As you can see, it promised to share a research plan before proceeding and then forgot about it. That‚Äôs why I recommend repeating the request when answering the context questions (which I didn‚Äôt do in this case).*

## ü§ñ How to quickly create high-quality prompts using AI

You can either design prompts yourself or ask AI to help (either to feedback your draft prompt or write one from scratch).

For example, if you ask ChatGPT o3 this‚Ä¶

![](https://www.operatorshandbook.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b3160d04-2eed-4755-9eeb-aa0e9e9db460_558x179.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:179,%22width%22:558,%22resizeWidth%22:502,%22bytes%22:38003,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:%22https://www.operatorshandbook.com/i/160819332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3160d04-2eed-4755-9eeb-aa0e9e9db460_558x179.png%22,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false})

‚Ä¶you get back [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZHtuB0NiKALkwoLN3md34L56tQEArXQvybX-gp0gi0/edit?usp=sharing).

**Note:** I recommend not just blindly copy-pasting the AI-generated prompt, but tweaking it to your purposes. For example, you can see that o3 included a lot of very specific asks, and these might not be exactly what you‚Äôre looking for.

Either way, it‚Äôs a good starting point and faster than creating a prompt from scratch.

---

## üí¨ Treating research as a conversation

Deep Research credits are limited, so crafting solid prompts is important. Still, I recommend to approach research with AI the same way you would with a human analyst.

There are several reasons why:

### 1\. It‚Äôs much easier to feedback something than to imagine the perfect deliverable

Can you describe what the perfect analysis of a topic looks like? Every little thing it needs to contain?

Probably not. But once you see one, you‚Äôll immediately know how it could be improved. In my experience, you get a strong result much faster by getting a first version and providing feedback than by obsessing over the perfect prompt.

This is especially true if you‚Äôre not an expert in the area. I often know so little about a topic that I don‚Äôt even know what questions I should be asking. So instead, I do the following:

1. First, I ask for a high-level overview *with suggestions for follow-up deep dives*
2. Then, after reviewing the initial report, I go deep on the most interesting areas one-by-one

This way, I avoid being overwhelmed by a 50-page report full of information I either don‚Äôt understand or don‚Äôt need. And with each deep dive, I get a better understanding and am able to refine my questions for the next ‚Äúresearch job‚Äù.

### 2\. The more prescriptive you are, the more you constrain the model‚Äôs reasoning

It‚Äôs the same as when you‚Äôre delegating work as a manager: You get some of the best deliverables when you give people some freedom in how they execute. For example, they might approach the problem from an angle you didn‚Äôt even consider.

If you give a super prescriptive research prompt, the best possible outcome is a report as good as what you would have created. But if you want to be positively surprised, you need to leave things a bit more open-ended.

### 3\. A research report is like a house of cards: Without a strong foundation, everything else falls apart

Imagine you get an in-depth report for how to build an ML model for a certain use case, including checklists, timeline estimates, code examples etc., only to realize that you forgot to provide a crucial piece of context.

Not only is all of that stuff useless now; since the report is so detailed, you probably spent way too much time digging through it until you realized it was fundamentally flawed.

When it comes to complex topics, **your initial focus should be on getting the core of the analysis right**. Then, once you‚Äôre happy with it, you can ask the AI to create downstream deliverables like detailed project plans or anything else you need to actually implement the recommendations.

## How to get the most value out of the final research report

As discussed above, ChatGPT Deep Research reports can be **long**; really long. Sometimes up to 20k words and more.

I don‚Äôt recommend reading them end-to-end the moment you get them, though. Instead, I‚Äôd treat them as a resource you can selectively reference whenever you need to go deep on a particular aspect.

To get a quick overview of the key points, it‚Äôs more efficient to feed the report back into ChatGPT (or another tool) and ask for a summary. And if you‚Äôre doing the research as part of a cross-functional project at work, **I highly recommend asking for multiple summaries tailored to specific audiences** (e.g. the PM, the Finance team etc.).

Lastly, humans aren‚Äôt the only ones who can get value out of Deep Research. You can also add the reports as context to any future AI conversations or projects:
