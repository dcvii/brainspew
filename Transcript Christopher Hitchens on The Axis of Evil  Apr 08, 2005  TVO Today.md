## Transcript: Christopher Hitchens on The Axis of Evil | Apr 08, 2005

Christopher Hitchens stands on a podium with a banner that reads "Centre for American Studies at the University of Western Ontario."

  

Christopher is in his forties, with short tousled gray hair and a scruffy salt and pepper beard. He's wearing a gray suit and gray polo shirt.

  

He says I APOLOGISE FOR MY SLIGHTLY

HEZBOLLAH APPEARANCE.

  

\[Audience Laughter\]

  

Christopher continues BUT I WAS TOLD IN MY RECENT

VOYAGE TO IRAN THAT THE MORE

SCRUFFY I LOOKED, THE MORE

PLAUSIBLE I WOULD APPEAR, AND

THE EASIER IT WOULD BE TO GO TO

THINGS LIKE FRIDAY PRAYERS, AND

IT SO PROVED.

IT'S A COUNTRY FOR THE SCRUFFY.

IT'S MY KIND OF MIDDLE EAST.

BY GOING TO IRAN, A COUNTRY I'D

HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY GETTING A

VISA FOR, FOR MANY, MANY YEARS,

I THINK I'VE BECOME THE ONLY

PERSON WHO HAS, SINCE THE YEAR

2000, BEEN ON THE GROUND IN

NORTH KOREA, IN IRAQ AND IN IRAN.

IN OTHER WORDS, I MAY NOW HAVE

A STUMP SPEECH THAT I CAN GO

AROUND GIVING.

THIS IS MY PROTOTYPE FOR IT, AS

A NATTER OF FACT, WHY I

SUGGESTED THAT WE MIGHT DISCUSS

THIS FAMOUS QUESTION OF THE

AXIS OF EVIL AND WHAT IT MEANS,

OR WHAT DIFFERENT THINGS IT

MIGHT COVER.

  

A caption appears on screen. It reads "Christopher Hitchens. Journalist. Axes of Evil. University of Western Ontario. March 8, 2005."

  

Christopher continues UM,

BUT I WANT TO BACK UP A LITTLE,

TO ABOUT A DECADE AGO, PERHAPS

A LITTLE MORE, THE MID '90s,

AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AND

KOSOVO, WHERE I ALSO SPENT SOME TIME.

I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY ADDED UP THE

EXACT NUMBER OF DAYS, BUT

LOOKING OUT AT YOU NOW, IT

STRIKES ME LOOKING OUT AT YOU

NOW, THAT A LOT OF YOU ARE

TERRIFYINGLY YOUNG, AND MAY NOT

EVEN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE

TO LIVE IN THE LAST MONTHS OF

1989, OR NOT REMEMBER IT VERY

CLEARLY, BUT FOR THOSE OF US OF

MY AGE, AND EVEN QUITE A LOT

YOUNGER, THE SENSE OF HUMAN

EMANCIPATION THAT OCCURRED WITH

THE COLLAPSE OF THE BERLIN

WALL, AND THE IMPLOSION OF THE

OSSIFIED FORM OF RUSSO-

COMMUNISM THAT HAD BEEN IMPOSED

ON EASTERN AND BALTIC EUROPE,

AND SOME OF BALKAN EUROPE, THAT

SENSE IS SOMETHING I CAN VERY

VIVIDLY CALL TO MIND.

I WAS IN ROMANIA AT THE TIME IT

ACTUALLY HAPPENED, WATCHING THE

OVERTHROW OF THE CEAUSESCU

REGIME, WHICH WAS PERHAPS THE

MOST BRUTAL AND CORRUPT, AS

WELL AS THE MOST UM...

THE ONE THAT WAS MOST CENTRED

ON A CULT OF PERSONALITY.

AND IT WASN'T JUST THAT IT WAS

EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE SO MANY

MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN SO MANY

DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND

SOCIETIES...

SIMPLY BY FOLDING THEIR ARMS

AND ADOPTING AN ATTITUDE OF

DEFIANCE, REVOLUTIONISING AND

CHANGING THEIR SYSTEM.

IT WASN'T THAT IT WAS SO MOVING

TO SEE THAT, IT WAS THE

REALISATION THAT THE COLD WAR

WAS OVER IN THE OTHER WAY, TOO.

THAT IT WAS QUITE LIKELY NOW

THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO THINK

EVERY DAY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

A MISTAKE OR A CRIME, OR A

BLUNDER LEADING TO WHAT WAS

EUPHEMISTICALLY CALLED IN MY

HOME TOWN OF WASHINGTON, D.C.,

A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE.

IMAGINE THINKING OF A THERMO

NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST AS AN

"EXCHANGE."

BUT THAT WAS THE WAY WE TRIED

TO MAKE THE THOUGHT GO AWAY.

IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY PERIOD.

AND IN THOSE DAYS, SOME OF YOU

WILL REMEMBER, AND YOU CAN LOOK

IT UP, THERE WAS TALK OF A

PEACE DIVIDEND, OF THE

POSSIBILITY OF TRANSFERRING THE

ENORMOUS RESOURCES THAT WE HAD

BEEN PUTTING INTO WARFARE, INTO

PEACEFUL PROJECTS AND INTO

DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE REAL

VICTIMS OF THE COLD WAR, WHO

WERE THE INHABITANTS OF THE

COUNTRIES WE USED TO CALL THE

THIRD WORLD.

THAT THERE WOULD BE, POSSIBLY,

A NEW INTERNATIONALISM, A NEW

COMITY INTERNATIONALLY, A NEW

RENUNCIATION OF FORCE, SOME

SPARE MONEY, AND A COMMON

FEELING THAT THE VALUES OF

PLURALISM AND DEMOCRACY WERE

WORTH HAVING FOR THEIR OWN

SAKE, AND HAD SO TO SPEAK,

PROVED THEIR WORTH IN

IDEOLOGICAL COMBAT AGAINST BOTH

FASCISM AND STALINISM.

IT WAS A BLISSFUL TIME TO BE

AROUND, I TELL YOU.

THAT'S NOVEMBER THE 9th, CALL

IT -- THAT'S THE DAY THE BERLIN

WALL FELL.

CEAUSESCU FELL, ACTUALLY, NOT

UNTIL CHRISTMAS DAY, CHRISTMAS

EVE IN BUCHAREST.

SO THAT'S THE END OF 1989.

THE 2nd OF AUGUST, IN 1990,

SADDAM HUSSEIN INVADED KUWAIT.

ACTUALLY IT'S NOT RALLY

STRICTLY TRUE TO SAY HE INVADED

KUWAIT, HE ANNEXED KUWAIT.

HE ANNOUNCED THAT KUWAIT WAS

PART OF IRAQ.

HE DID SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER

BEEN TRIED BEFORE, ABOLISH THE

EXISTENCE OF A MEMBER STATE OF

THE UNITED NATIONS, A FELLOW

MUSLIM STATE, AND MEMBER OF THE

ARAB LEAGUE -- QUITE AN

EXTRAORDINARY THING TO HAVE DONE.

AND AROUND THAT TIME, SLOBODAN

MILOSEVIC TRIED TO IMPOSE THE

IDEA OF A NATIONAL SOCIALIST

GREATER SERBIA ON HIS

NEIGHBOURS IN FIRST SLOVENIA,

AND THEN CROATIA, AND THEN,

MOST HEINOUSLY IN BOSNIA-

HERZEGOVINA, AND THEN IN KOSOVO.

AND SUDDENLY IT HIT ME.

I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PART OF

THIS NAIVE CHORUS ABOUT THE END

OF HISTORY AND THE PEACE

DIVIDEND.

I HAD SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT

IT, WHICH I PUBLISHED, BUT I

HAD SHARED IN THE GENERAL

OPTIMISM.

OF COURSE WE WERE NOT YET OUT

FROM UNDER THE RULE, OR THE

DANGER THAT POSED BY

PSYCHOPATHIC DICTATORSHIP.

SO I HAD TO SPEND A LOT OF

TIME, FIRST IN NORTHERN IRAQ

AND KURDISTAN, THEN IN SARAJEVO

AND MOSCOW, WITNESSING WHAT

HAPPENS WHEN DICTATORS ARE

ALLOWED TO GET THEIR WAY.

AND THE SHAMEFUL THOUGHT THAT

ONE HAD ABOUT IT, IN BOTH

CASES, THE CASES OF SADDAM

HUSSEIN AND SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC,

THEY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO GET

AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT

THEY WERE THOUGHT OF BY WESTERN

DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES AS ALLIES,

EVEN SOMETIMES AS CLIENTS, OR

IF ONE COULDN'T GO QUITE THAT

FAR, AS NECESSARY PARTNERS FOR

NEGOTIATION.

AND IN FACT, MILOSEVIC, I

REMEMBER BEING CALLED BY THE

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, "A

PARTNER IN PEACE" IS WHEN HE

CAME-- HE DEIGNED TO COME TO

SIGN THE DAYTON ACCORDS WITH

UM... DON'T LET ME FORGET HIS

NAME, MR. CLINTON'S NEGOTIATOR,

RICHARD--

HOLBROOKE, THANK YOU.

UM... ALTHOUGH MR. HOLBROOKE

HAD TO GRANT MILOSEVIC

IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION TO

LAND ON AN AMERICAN AIRFORCE

BASE, AND THIS IMMUNITY WAS

GRANTED TO HIM.

I FELT THAT WAS A MOMENT OF

SHAME, AND I BEGAN TO EVOLVE

THE FOLLOWING VIEW OF IT.

CO-EXISTENCE WITH PSYCHOPATHIC

DICTATORSHIPS IS, IN FACT, NOT

POSSIBLE.

AND THAT IS A GOOD THING,

PROBABLY, BECAUSE IT--

NOR IS IT DESIRABLE.

TWO OR THREE YEARS AFTER

MILOSEVIC HAD BEEN CALLED A

PARTNER IN PEACE AT DAYTON, ONE

OF HIS OTHER CONDITIONS, AS

WELL AS NOT BEING ARRESTED, WAS

THAT THE NAME KOSOVO NOT BE

MENTIONED IN ANY OF THE

CONVERSATIONS, THAT THE SUBJECT

NOT BE BROUGHT UP.

THAT WAS ACCEDED TO AS WELL BY

THE ADMINISTRATION SO EAGER TO

DECLARE A PEACEFUL VICTORY.

HE HAD TO BE IN EFFECT EVICTED

FROM POWER IN HIS OWN COUNTRY,

JUST AS THOSE WHO HE HAD

EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES IN

BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AND KOSOVO,

HAD TO BE FORCIBLY TAKEN HOME,

AND HIS ETHNIC CLEANSING

UNDONE.

IN ALL THE YEARS THAT WERE

SPENT IN TRYING TO CONTAIN, OR

EVEN TO COERCE OR TO CIVILISE

DOMESTICATE THIS MAN, HAD BEEN

WASTED.

THEY HAD, IN FACT, ALL BEEN

EXPLOITED BY HIM TO ADVANCE HIS

PROGRAM, HIS MAD IDEA OF A

GREATER SERBIA.

AND THE SAME HAD BEEN TRUE

EVERY TIME PEOPLE HAD EVER

TRIED TO MAKE NICE WITH SADDAM

HUSSEIN.

IT SEEMED THAT HIS APPETITE FOR

POWER ONLY GREW WITH THE

EATING.

AND THEN IN A COUNTRY, THAT

MOST PEOPLE HADN'T BEEN

THINKING ABOUT, IN RWANDA, A

RACIST PARTY DECIDED THAT IT

COULD BRING ABOUT A FINAL

SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF ITS

RACISM, NAMELY THE

EXTERMINATION OF THE MEMBERS OF

THE OTHER TRIBE, AND OF THE

MEMBERS OF ITS OWN TRIBE WHO

WERE AGAINST GENOCIDE.

AND THEY KNEW, BY THIS STAGE,

THEY KNEW THAT THEY COULD DO

THIS WITHOUT THE DANGER OR EVEN

THE THREAT, OR THE RISK OF

FOREIGN INTERVENTION OR ANY

RESISTANCE TO THEIR PLANNED

PROGRAM OF EXTERMINATION, AND

THEY WERE RIGHT.

AND MEANWHILE IN NORTH KOREA,

THE WAR THAT NEVER STOPPED --

NORTH KOREA IS STILL OFFICIALLY

AT WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.

WE ARE ONLY IN AN ARMISTICE

PERIOD, A PERIOD OF ARMISTICE

THAT WAS--

I SAY WE, YOU'LL PARDON ME --

THE UNITED STATES IS ONLY IN A

PERIOD OF ARMISTICE AND ARMED

TRUCE WITH NORTH KOREA, EVER

SINCE THE ARMISTICE OF 1951.

IT SEEMED THAT YET ANOTHER

STATE OF THE ONE PARTY AND THE

ONE MAN AND THE ONE IDEOLOGY,

WANTED TO BECOME GRANDER STILL

BY THE ACQUISITION OF WEAPONS

OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU HOW

THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN

COMPLETELY CONSUMED BY THIS

QUESTION, AND HOW TO ADDRESS

AND APPROACH IT.

AND I'LL GIVE YOU, IF I MAY,

GIVE YOU THREE BRIEF CAPSULES,

FIRST FROM IRAQ, AND THEN FROM

NORTH KOREA AND THEN FROM IRAN.

I THINK THE WAY I WOULD WANT TO

PUT IT, ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE IN

SADDAM HUSSEIN'S IRAQ, THE WAY

THAT IS MOST MEMORABLE TO ME.

I WILL HOPE WILL BE MEMORABLE

TO YOU, TOO.

IF YOU GO TO EL SALVADOR, SAY,

OR SOUTH AFRICA OR POLAND OR

THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, YOU CAN

MEET PEOPLE WHO WERE HEROIC

MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION IN

THE BAD OLD DAYS, AND THEY CAN

TELL YOU TERRIBLE STORIES ABOUT

WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AND TO

THEIR FAMILIES.

BUT WHAT I NOTICED ABOUT IRAQ

WAS NOT JUST THAT EVERY IRAQI

AND IRAQI KURD THAT I KNEW

COULD TELL A TERRIBLE STORY

ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO

HIMSELF OR HERSELF OR THEIR

FAMILIES, BUT EVERYBODY I KNEW

WHO HAD BEEN A MEMBER OR

SUPPORTER OF THE GOVERNMENT

COULD TELL THE SAME STORY OF

HOW THEIR FAMILIES HAD

DISAPPEARED OR HOW THEY,

THEMSELVES HAD BEEN ARRESTED

FOR NO REASON AND BRUTALLY

TORTURED.

I KNEW, FOR EXAMPLE, QUITE

WELL, A MAN CALLED MAZEN

ZARHAWI, HE WAS SADDAM

HUSSEIN'S PERSONAL INTERPRETER

IN ENGLISH, HE SPOKE ENGLISH

FAULTLESSLY.

HE WAS HALF KURDISH, AND HE WAS, I

THINK, 100 percent GAY, WHICH IS A

RISKY POSITION ALREADY TO HAVE

IN SADAM'S IRAQ, AND HE

PRIVATELY PRODUCED A TAPE OF

THE PLAY OF "THE IMPORTANCE OF

BEING ERNEST" WITH HIMSELF IN

THE PART OF LADY BRACKNELL.

  

\[Audience Laughter\]

  

Christopher continues A REMARKABLE CHAP, AND ALWAYS AT

THE SIDE OF THE LEADER, BUT

UNFORTUNATELY, HAD TO BE AT THE

SIDE OF THE LEADER, WHEN, AFTER

THE INVASION OF KUWAIT, FOREIGN

LEADERS FLEW INTO BAGDAD TO

REPROACH MR. SADDAM HUSSEIN, TO

UPBRAID HIM, TO URGE HIM TO GET

OUT OF KUWAIT WHILE THERE WAS

STILL TIME TO OBEY THE

RESOLUTIONS AND TO AVOID A WAR.

MANY OF THEM SPOKE TO HIM

RATHER BRUSQUELY, AND SADDAM

HUSSEIN DOESN'T LIKE BEING

SPOKEN TO BRUSQUELY BY ANYBODY.

NO MAFIA CHIEFTAIN WILL BE

INSULTED IN FRONT OF HIS

UNDERLINGS.

AND THOSE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM,

WHO'S HAD TO SEE IT HAPPEN,

NAMELY THE INTERPRETER, I

THINK, MUST HAVE KNOWN AT THAT

MOMENT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

DIE, BECAUSE THEY HAD SEEN

SOMETHING THAT THEY WEREN'T

SUPPOSED TO SEE.

AND THOUGH EVERYONE HAD KNOWN

ALL THE TIME THAT MAZEN WAS

KURDISH AND GAY, IT HADN'T BEEN

HELD AGAINST HIM PARTICULARLY,

HE WAS TOO USEFUL.

SUDDENLY IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT

THESE THINGS MADE HIM A

TRAITOR, AND HE WAS TORN TO

DEATH-- TORN TO PIECES IN A

DUNGEON IN WAYS THAT I WON'T

BOTHER TO DETAIL TO YOU.

ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE, NAJI

SABRI AL-HADITHI, THE LAST

FOREIGN MINISTER OF SADAM'S

IRAQ, WHO I'D MET ORIGINALLY

WHEN HE RAN THE IRAQI CULTURAL

CENTRE IN LONDON -- HE ROSE TO

BE CULTURAL MINISTER BY MEANS

OF BEING THE EDITOR OF THE

BAGDAD DAILY, WHICH WAS A JOB

OF HIS IN THE MEANTIME.

ONE OF HIS BROTHERS WAS

AMBASSADOR TO MOSCOW FOR IRAQ,

WAS RECALLED FROM MOSCOW,

TORTURED TO DEATH WITH NO

CHARGES, NO EXPLANATION,

NOTHING EVER SAID, AND THE

FOREIGN MINISTER'S OTHER

BROTHER WAS RECALLED FROM

ANOTHER POST AND TORTURED NOT

QUITE TO DEATH, AND HE WENT OUT

TO BE SADAM'S FOREIGN MINISTER

AS A BROKEN MAN.

HE WENT OUT TO REPRESENT THE

MAN WHO HAD MUTILATED HIS

FAMILY.

PSYCHOPATHIC, SADISTIC

DICTATORS LIKE TO DO THIS TO

PEOPLE.

THEY LIKE TO SHOW WHO'S BOSS.

PEOPLE OFTEN USE THE WORD

SYSTEMATIC WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT

REPRESSION OR ABUSE OF HUMAN

RIGHTS, THEY SAY THESE THINGS

ARE SYSTEMATICALLY ABUSED.

OF COURSE THAT'S THE CORRECT

WAY OF UNDERSTANDING IT, BUT IT

MISSES A CERTAIN POINT.

IT MUST BE UNSYSTEMATIC ALSO,

IT MUST BE CAPRICIOUS, IT MUST

BE UNPREDICTABLE.

NOBODY MUST KNOW THAT THEY'RE

SAFE.

NOBODY CAN THINK, I NOW HAVE

PASSED ALL THE TESTS THAT MAKE

ME A LOYAL MEMBER OF THE BA'ATH

PARTY, I'M GOING TO BE ALL

RIGHT.

THEY WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO

GET TO THAT MOMENT.

THE FEAR, THE REPUBLIC OF FEAR,

AS MY FRIEND KANAN MAKIYA

DESCRIBED IT IN HIS BRILLIANT

PROFILE ABOUT THIS.

IT MUST ALWAYS BE MAINTAINED.

FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SADAM --

THERE'S EVEN A VIDEO OF THIS.

YOU CAN GET IT IF YOU WANT.

WHEN HE PURGED THE PARTY, HE

HAD THE ROOM FULL OF THE

CENTRAL COMMITTEE, PROBABLY

ABOUT AS FULL AS THIS ONE IS,

AND THEN SOMEONE IS BROUGHT IN

TO MAKE A CONFESSION, AN

OBVIOUSLY BROKEN PERSON, WHO

SOBS A CONFESSION INTO A

MICROPHONE, STANDING THERE

HAGGARDLY AND STARTS READING

OUT A LIST OF THE NAMES OF THE

TRAITORS WHO ARE IN THE PLOT.

AND THEY ARE IN THE AUDIENCE,

AND THEY ARE POINTED TO, AND

THE GUARDS COME AND TAKE THEM

AWAY, ONE BY ONE.

AND NOBODY IN THE ROOM KNOWS IF

THEY'RE ON THE LIST YET

THEMSELVES.

PEOPLE BEGIN TO WEEP AND SCREAM

AND CRY, AND MAKE HYSTERICAL

DECLARATIONS OF LOVE AND

ADULATIONS FOR SADAM HUSSEIN,

EVEN AS THEY'RE VOMITING AND

EXCRETING WITH FEAR.

AND THEN IT'S OVER, AND THE

ONES WHO ARE IN THE PLOT HAVE

BEEN DRAGGED FROM THE ROOM, AND

THEN THE VIDEO COMES TO AN END.

AND THEN THERE'S A SECOND HALF,

WHICH I HAVEN'T SEEN.

IT'S HARDER TO GET -- THAT THE

PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED, THEN HAVE

TO GO OUT INTO THE COURTYARD

AND SHOOT THEIR FORMER

COLLEAGUES WHO WERE FOUND TO BE

PART OF THE CONSPIRACY.

THAT'S A DETAIL THAT, AS KANAN

MAKIYA SAYS, NEITHER STALIN NOR

HITLER EVER THOUGHT OF DOING

THAT.

THAT'S A SPECIAL TWIST, A

DETAIL, AN EXQUISITE ADDITION,

IF YOU LIKE, FOR SHOWING WHO'S

IN POWER, AND FOR MAKING AN

ACCOMPLICE OF EVERYONE WHO

SERVES YOU, FOR DIRTYING THEM

UP, AS THE MOBSTERS WOULD SAY.

I DON'T TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE

I'M INTERESTED IN THE

PORNOGRAPHY OF DICTATORSHIP,

THOUGH I AM, I TELL YOU THIS,

BECAUSE I COULD FIND PEOPLE ALL

OVER WASHINGTON, D.C. WH WOULD

NONETHELESS SAY TO ME, WELL,

SADAM MAY BE A BAD GUY--

BY THE WAY, ANYONE WHO STARTS A

SENTENCE SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW

RIGHT AWAY, KNOWS AND CARES

NOTHING ABOUT IRAQ.

SADAM MAY BE A BAD GUY, THEY

WOULD SAY -- AND I HOPE NONE OF

YOU HAVE SAID IT, AND I HOPE IF

YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAYING IT FROM

NOW ON, YOU'LL CHALLENGE IT.

HE MAY BE A BAD GUY, THE

ARGUMENT WENT ON, BUT HE'S A

REALIST, HE UNDERSTANDS

CONTAINMENT, HE UNDERSTANDS

SELF-PRESERVATION, HE

UNDERSTANDS SELF INTEREST.

NOT SO, NOT SO AT ALL.

IT'S QUITE EVIDENT TO ME, AND

TO ANYONE WHO TASTED WHAT THE

ATMOSPHERE OF IRAQ INSIDE WAS

LIKE, AND HAVE SEEN THE MASS

GRAVES AND HEARD THE STORIES,

THAT HERE WAS A MAN WHO WAS

QUITE OBVIOUSLY DELUSIONAL, AND

WHO HAD, AROUND HIM, FOR

REASONS THAT MUST BE OBVIOUS TO

YOU BY NOW, IF THEY WEREN'T

BEFORE, NO ONE WHO WOULD TELL

HIM HE WAS MAKING A MISTAKE.

FOR HIM TO INVADE KUWAIT WAS AN

EXTRAORDINARY MISTAKE.

FOR HIM TO REFUSE TO GET OUT,

THINKING HE WOULD GET AWAY WITH

IT, SHOWED THAT HE MUST HAVE

LOST CONTROL OF HIS SENSES.

HE WAS VISITED-- OR HIS FOREIGN

MINISTER WAS SUMMONED, RATHER,

BY JAMES BAKER JUST BEFORE THE

COALITION INTERVENTION BEGAN,

TARIQ AZIZ WAS HANDED A NOTE IN

VIENNA, I BELIEVE IT WAS, OR

PERHAPS ZURICH.

HE WAS TOLD, SINCE YOU'RE NOT

GOING TO LEAVE KUWAIT, WE'RE

GOING TO THROW YOU OUT.

YOU'VE RUN OUT YOUR CLOCK.

BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

IF YOU DO ANY OF THREE THINGS, WE WILL

CONSIDER OURSELVES FREED FROM

ALL MILITARY RESTRAINT, AND

EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS

WHEN THE UNITED STATES SAYS IT.

WE'LL DENY OURSELVES NO COURSE

OF ACTION -- ANY ONE OF THESE

THREE THINGS.

IF YOU SET FIRE TO THE KUWAITI OIL

FIELDS OR TRY TO DESTROY THE

KUWAITI OIL INDUSTRY ON YOUR WAY

OUT, IF YOU DO THAT, OR

SABOTAGE IT, WE WILL CONSIDER

OURSELVES NOT BOUND BY U.N.

RESOLUTIONS.

IF YOU USE INTERNATIONAL

TERRORISM AGAINST US, AND TRY

AND OPEN A SECOND FRONT OF THAT

TYPE, THE SAME APPLIES, AND IF

YOU USE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL

WEAPONS ON OUR FORCES.

NOW WE DON'T KNOW, I, AT ANY

RATE, DON'T CLAIM TO KNOW WHAT

THE GULF WAR SYNDROME THAT

AFFECTS SO MANY SOLDIERS

ACTUALLY IS, BUT IT IS

CONSISTENT WITH AT LEAST THE

POSSIBILITY THAT SOME LOCAL

COMMANDERS OF SADAM HUSSEIN'S

WERE ALLOWED TO, ENABLED TO,

PERMITTED TO USE THOSE WEAPONS

IN THE FIELD.

IT'S NOT TO BE EXCLUDED.

I WON'T SAY IT CAN BE ASSERTED.

IT'S WORTH BEARING IN MIND.

IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THAT ON HIS

WAY OUT OF KUWAIT, WHEN HE HAD

NOTHING TO LOSE, AND NOTHING TO

GAIN, QUITE POINTLESSLY,

VICIOUSLY, SADDAM HUSSEIN

ORDERED NOT JUST THE IGNITION

OF THE OIL FIELDS, BUT THE

SMASHING OF THE HEADS OF THE

OIL WELLS SO THAT THE OIL WOULD

RUN STRAIGHT INTO THE GULF,

WHICH IT DID.

IT WAS THOUGHT, AT ONE POINT,

THAT IT WOULD TAKE TEN YEARS TO

CLEAN IT UP.

AND IT DESTROYED ALMOST ALL THE

MARINE AND BIRD LIFE OF THE

AREA, AS WELL AS CAUSING AN

APPALLING CONFLAGRATION THAT

RAGED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS

BEFORE, AND THIS WILL DEPRESS

SOME OF YOU, IT WAS PUT OUT BY

HALIBURTON, BY KELLOGG BROWN

AND ROOT, ROBERT RATHER MORE

QUICKLY THAN THAT.

SORRY TO BREAK THE NEWS, BUT

THERE IT IS.

AND UM...

THE FOLLOWING YEAR, WHEN GEORGE

BUSH MADE A VISIT TO KUWAIT,

GEORGE BUSH SENIOR, MADE A

VISIT TO KUWAIT, TO CELEBRATE,

AS IT WERE, THE ANNIVERSARY OF

THE LIBERATION, AN IRAQI DEATH

SQUAD WAS CAUGHT RED HANDED

TRYING TO KILL HIM.

IMAGINE IF THEY HAD SUCCEEDED.

SO THAT YOU HAD A DICTATOR, WHO

WAS ACTUALLY INSANELY AND

OBSCENELY RASH.

AND WHOSE MOVEMENTS COULD NOT

BE PREDICTED, AND WHOSE SENSE

OF SELF-PRESERVATION WAS

EXTREMELY FRAGILE, AND WHOSE

HOLD ON REALITY HAD LARGELY

GONE.

AND IT WAS FOR THIS REASON, AND

FOR HIS CONTINUED INTEREST IN

WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND

THE SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM,

THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WAS

LONG OVERDUE TO REMOVE HIM FROM

POWER, AND THAT THE YEAR TO

HAVE DONE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

1991.

AND IT'S A SHAME AND A DISGRACE

TO THE CIVILISED WORLD, IN MY

OPINION, THAT IT ALLOWED

CONTINUED COEXISTENCE,

CONTINUED SURVIVAL TO THIS

REGIME, AND WASTED A DOZEN

YEARS OF THE LIVES OF THE IRAQI

PEOPLE WHICH WERE CONSUMED BY

THE LOCUST.

BUT I DARE SAY PEOPLE WILL WANT

TO ASK ME ABOUT THAT.

WHEN I WENT TO PYONGYANG IN

NORTH KOREA AND STARTED

TRAVELLING AS FAR AS I COULD

OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL CITY,

THOUGH NO JOURNALIST HAS EVER

BEEN ALLOWED TO GO OFF ON THEIR

OWN, IN NORTH KOREA, AND I

DON'T THINK, EVER WILL BE.

AND IN ANY CASE, IT'S A LAW IN

KOREA THAT NO KOREAN IS ALLOWED

TO SPEAK TO A FOREIGN VISITOR.

SO IT'S HARDLY NECESSARY TO

PREVENT JOURNALISTS FROM TRYING

TO TALK TO THEM, BECAUSE YOU

CAN SEE IN THE FACE OF ANY

NORTH KOREAN, IF YOU CAN GET

THAT NEAR THEM, THAT THEY'LL

BACK AWAY, FRIGHTENED.

THEY KNOW THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED

TO.

ONE THEREFORE CANNOT GIVE YOU

QUITE AS MANY ANECDOTES ABOUT

WHAT THE TEXTURE OF EVERYDAY

LIFE IS.

HOWEVER, I AM ONE OF THOSE

AUTHORS WHO DOES THEIR BEST TO

WAGE A WAR ON CLICHÉ.

I WENT TO PRAGUE ONCE, UNDER

THE DAYS OF THE OLD STALINIST

REGIME, AND I THOUGHT, WHATEVER

HAPPENS TO ME ON THIS VISIT, I

AM NOT GOING TO MENTION FRANZ KAFKA.

I'M GOING TO BE THE FIRST WRITER TO

REPORT FROM COMMUNIST PRAGUE,

WHO DOESN'T HAVE KAFKA IN THE

PIECE.

THAT I KNOW GOING IN.

I WENT TO A MEETING OF VACLAV

HAVEL'S OPPOSITION GROUP IN A

PRIVATE HOME.

THE MEETING WENT ON FOR A

LITTLE WHILE, AND THE DOOR

SUDDENLY FELL IN.

THERE WAS A MOB OF SECRET POLICEMEN,

DOGS AND SEARCH LIGHTS, AND A

VIDEO CAMERA TO CATCH US ALL ON.

THEY SMASH YOU UP AGAINST THE

WALL, "YOU'RE COMING WITH US."

"WHERE ARE WE GOING, AND WHAT'S

THE CHARGE?"

"WE'RE NOT TELLING YOU WHAT THE

CHARGE IS."

I THOUGHT, "SHIT, NOW I'VE GOT

TO MENTION KAFKA."

  

\[Audience Laughter\]

  

Christopher continues THEY MAKE YOU DO IT.

IT'S COMPULSORY.

WELL, WHEN I'D SPENT SOME TIME

IN NORTH KOREA, WHERE...

THE HEAD OF STATE IS THE DEAD

FATHER OF THE CURRENT LEADER,

KIM JONG-IL, THE DEAR LEADER,

IS HEAD OF THE PARTY IN NORTH

KOREA, THE KOREA WORKS PARTY,

AND HE'S HEAD OF THE ARMED

FORCES, BUT HE'S NOT HEAD OF

STATE.

HIS DEAD FATHER IS STILL THE

HEAD OF STATE, FOREVER.

MAKES IT, I THINK, THE WORLD'S

FIRST NECROCRACY.

  

\[Audience Laughter\]

  

Christopher continues OR MAUSELOCRAY OR THANITOCRACY,

BUT ABSENT THAT COMPLETELY

INSANE DETAIL, HERE'S WHAT IT'S

LIKE.

THERE'S A PICTURE OF HIM ON

EVERY WALL.

THERE HAS TO BE A PICTURE OF

HIM IN EVERY HOUSE.

HE IS NEVER OFF THE TELEVISION

SCREEN, HE IS NEVER OFF THE

WIRELESS, THE RADIO.

ALL FILMS ARE ABOUT HIM, AND

ALL PLAYS ARE ABOUT HIM, ALL

EDUCATION IS ABOUT HIM, ALL

PUBLIC EVENTS ARE ABOUT HIM,

ALL HOLIDAYS ARE ABOUT HIM.

UM...

AND IT'S AS IF SOMEBODY IN

1950, WHICH IS THE YEAR THAT

GEORGE ORWELL DIED, IN NORTH

KOREA GOT HOLD OF A COPY OF

"1984," AND THOUGHT, I WONDER

IF WE COULD MAKE THIS WORK?

  

\[Audience Laughter\]

  

Christopher continues ANYWAY, LET'S HAVE A GO,

BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THESE PEOPLE

LOCKED UP IN THIS SMALL

COUNTRY, WITH STALIN AND MAO ON

OUR NORTHERN BORDERS, WHICH

AREN'T VERY LONG, WITH AN

UNCROSSABLE MILITARY FRONTIER,

THE DEMILITARISED ZONE, IN THE

SOUTH, ARE THE OCEAN ON BOTH

SIDES, COMPLETELY HERMETIC.

ALREADY FOR A LONG TIME, CUT

OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD.

WE COULD DO AN EXPERIMENT HERE.

MAYBE WE COULD CREATE A

PERFECTLY SUPERVISED, PERFECTLY

REGIMENTED, PERFECTLY DRILLED

SOCIETY WHERE EVERYONE WAS THE

PROPERTY OF THE STATE 24-7, AS

IT WERE, WHERE THERE WAS NO--

NO RESPITE.

AND I HEARD, OF COURSE, THAT

THEY DO MARCH THE CHILDREN TO

SCHOOL CARRYING THE PICTURE OF

THE LEADER, THEY DO, DO ALL

THIS STUFF, SO WHEN I FIRST SAW

IT, I THOUGHT, YEAH THAT'S

RIGHT, I KNEW THEY DID THIS.

THEN AFTER A FEW DAYS, I

THOUGHT, THEY ACTUALLY DO, DO

IT, AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT

EVERY DAY SINCE 1950.

AND THEY'LL BE DOING IT AFTER

I'VE GONE.

NOW THE PROMISE OF THE

AUTHORITARIAN STATE, THE STATE

THAT SAYS THAT YOU ARE STATE

PROPERTY, YOU, THE CITIZEN

BELONG TO US, IS THAT IN

RETURN, YOU WILL GET, SAY THREE

MEALS A DAY, AND YOUR CHILDREN

WON'T STARVE AND WILL BE

CLOTHED AND SO FORTH, AND

YOU'LL BE HOUSED.

THAT'S THE LEAST YOU CAN EXPECT

FOR BEING STATE PROPERTY.

AND FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD

OF TIME IN SOME OF THE EASTERN

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, A VERSION

OF THAT PROMISE WAS KEPT.

IT BEGAN TO BREAK DOWN, AND IN

CHINA, TOO, A VERSION OF IT WAS

KEPT, WHICH HAS BROKEN DOWN

FROM TIME TO TIME.

AND IT IS ALSO NOW BE REPLACED

BY CAPITALISM.

IN NORTH KOREA, YOU'RE STATE

PROPERTY BUT YOU'RE STARVING.

IT'S A FAMINE STATE.

WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY NORTH

KOREANS DIED IN THE FAMINE OF

THE '90s, AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

TO FIND OUT.

BUT IT'S SEVERAL MILLION.

AND THE AVERAGE HEIGHT OF

PEOPLE IN NORTH KOREA HAS

SHRUNK BY SEVERAL INCHES.

AND OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION

I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE

DIDN'T ANY SHORTER WHO HAD

ALREADY FULLY GROWN, EXCUSE ME,

BUT OF THE -- THOUGH IF THE

REGIME COULD MAKE THAT HAPPEN,

IT WOULD CERTAINLY GIVE IT A

TRY.

BUT THE BABIES BORN IN THAT

PERIOD, THE YOUNG OF KOREA ARE

MUCH, MUCH, MUCH SHORTER THAN

THEIR SOUTH KOREAN

COUNTERPARTS, OR THEIR PARENTS.

AND EVEN THOUGH THE REGIME MAKES

EVERY EFFORT TO SHOW YOU ONLY

THE GOOD BITS OF THE COUNTRY,

IT CAN'T STOP YOU SEEING FROM

THE BUS, AS YOU GO ACROSS THE

COUNTRY, OLD PEOPLE PICKING UP

INDIVIDUAL GRAINS OF RICE FROM

THE FIELDS, AND PEOPLE TRYING

TO EAT GRASS.

IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO CONCEAL A THING

OF THIS KIND.

SO THAT THE PROMISE, AS IT

WERE, HAS BROKEN DOWN.

I FINALLY HAD TO EAT A DOG, I

WAS SO HUNGRY MYSELF, AND I WAS

A PRIVILEGED VISITOR, AND A

PROTECTED GUEST IN A PRIVILEGED

CITY OF PYONGYANG, BUT I

FINALLY HAD TO HAVE A POOCH FOR

SUPPER.

THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME WHAT

KIND.

I SOMEHOW WANTED TO KNOW.

IT WAS A BIG DOG, THEY SAID, AS

IF THAT MADE IT BETTER SOMEHOW.

DON'T ASK FOR A DOGGIE BAG IF

YOU'RE IN NORTH KOREA, ANYWAY.

  

\[Audience Laughter\]

  

Christopher continues AND I ACTUALLY GOT THINNER

MYSELF.

I MUST GO THERE MORE OFTEN IF

YOU LIKE.

BUT IN OTHER WORDS IT'S THE

PERFECT COMBINATION OF EVIL, IF

YOU WILL.

THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM IS

UNKNOWN.

IT'S NOT JUST NEGATED, IT'S NOT

KNOWN, IT DOESN'T EXIST.

THE CONCEPT OF RIGHTS DO NOT

EXIST.

BUT NOR IS THERE THE MOST

ELEMENTARY PROVISION FOR

EDUCATION, HEALTH, NUTRITION

AND SO FORTH.

THAT'S THE BEST WAY I CAN PUT

IT.

THEY MANAGE TO MAXIMISE THE

WORST FORMS OF ALL KINDS OF

OPPRESSION, AND CONDENSE,

REFINE, DISTILL, AND THEN

AGAIN, REFINE THEM, TO MAKE IT

THE MOST MISERABLE PLACE IN THE

HISTORY, PERHAPS, OF THE WORLD,

AND CERTAINLY ON THE FACE OF

THE PLANET AT PRESENT.

AND, AS ALWAYS WITH SUCH

COUNTRIES, THERE IS ONLY ONE

THING THAT DOES WORK, AND

THAT'S THE MILITARY AND THE

POLICE.

AND WE KNOW THAT THE POWER

PROJECTION, MADE BY THE REGIME,

THE WAY IT BELIEVES THAT IT CAN

SUSTAIN ITSELF AND SURVIVE

THESE RIGOURS AND THESE

PRESSURES, IS TO USE NUCLEAR

WEAPONS EITHER AS BLACKMAIL OR

AS UM...

WHAT WOULD BE THE WORD --

EXTORTION.

IN OTHER WORDS TO ASK FOR THE

FOOD IT CAN'T GROW, TO BE

DELIVERED TO ITS DOORSTEP IN

EXCHANGE FOR EMPTY PROMISES

ABOUT A POSSIBLE FUTURE

DENUCLEARISATION.

HERE'S HOW CRAZY IT IS, BY THE

WAY.

USAID, WHEN IT GIVES OUT BAGS

OF GRAIN, OR WHATEVER ELSE IT

MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE, THEY INSIST

ON STENCILING ON THE SACKS THE

STARS AND STRIPES, AND IT SAYS,

"A GIFT FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE

UNITED STATES."

AND IT WILL SAY IT ALSO IN THE

LOCAL LANGUAGE.

SO THAT THE STUFF CAN'T BE

ABUSED, AND SO THAT PEOPLE

KNOW IT'S FROM AMERICA.

IT'S A SMALL ENOUGH THING.

NORTH KOREANS DON'T MIND

HANDING IT OUT LIKE THAT AT ALL

BEFORE IT GOES ONTO THE BLACK

MARKET, WHERE IT'S USUALLY

BOUGHT UP BY THE ARMY AND THE

PARTY PEOPLE IF IT ISN'T--

WHO HAVE FIRST CRACK AT IT

ANYWAY.

BUT THEY DON'T MIND PEOPLE IN

THE STARVING OUTLYING AREAS

SEEING THIS, BECAUSE THEY SAY,

YOU SEE, OUR LEADER IS SO MUCH

LOVED BY THE REST OF THE WORLD,

THAT HE IS--

AND SO MUCH FEARED, AND SO MUCH

RESPECTED, THAT TRIBUTE IS PAID

TO HIM, AND IT COMES EVEN FROM

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

AND THE PEOPLE HAVE NO MEANS OF

KNOWING THAT THIS ISN'T TRUE.

WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHETHER

THEY CAN GUESS THAT OR NOT.

I'D GIVE A LOT TO KNOW WHAT

GOES ON IN THEIR MINDS.

NORTH KOREANS ARE STARTING TO

DEFECT NOW -- VERY DANGEROUS

BUSINESS, ACROSS THE BORDER

FROM CHINA.

THEY DIDN'T USED TO DO THAT

BEFORE.

WE'LL SEE, BUT IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE, I CANNOT DECEIVE YOU,

I CANNOT GIVE YOU A DIRECT

ACCOUNT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN

THE NORTH KOREAN MIND.

BUT WE WILL, I THINK, SOON FIND

OUT.

AT ANY RATE, I WOULD SAY THAT

THERE WAS A VERY STRONG

CORRELATION, THEREFORE, BETWEEN

THE INTERNAL NIGHTMARE OF THE

IDEOLOGY OF THE REGIME, AND THE

NEED, ON ITS PART, TO IMPOSE

ITSELF ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD AS

WELL.

THESE TWO THINGS ARE NOT

COINCIDENTAL, THEY'RE

INDISSOLUBLY CONNECTED.

WELL TO IRAN.

UM, SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT.

THE REGIME, HAS OUTLIVED, FOR

EXAMPLE, THE MAN WHOSE PORTRAIT

IS INDEED EVERYWHERE, THE

AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI.

HE HAS BEEN DEAD SINCE 1989.

BUT THE REGIME WHICH DISPLAYS

HIS PICTURE STILL GOES ON.

IT IS STILL A THEOCRACY BUILT

IN THE IMAGE OF ONE MAN, AND ON

ONE RATHER PARTICULAR

INTERPRETATION OF THE RIGHTS OF

SHIA CLERICS TO MAKE LAWS.

IT IS, ACTUALLY A DECLINING

REGIME FOR THAT REASON, BECAUSE

THE GENERATION OF MULLAHS WHO

IMPOSED THIS REVOLUTION, AND

THE GENERATION OF REVOLUTIONARY

GUARDS WHO ACTUALLY IMPOSED IT

BY FORCE, IS DYING AND

MORIBUND, AND IT'S VERY CLEAR.

I WENT SEVERAL TIMES TO THE

WEEKLY FRIDAY PRAYERS THAT ARE

STILL HELD AT THE UNIVERSITY.

THE ANNUAL RALLY, EXCUSE ME,

THE WEEKLY RALLY OF THE REGIME.

AND ALL THE SPEAKERS WERE VERY

ELDERLY, AND OFTEN QUITE

QUAVERING, AND SNOWY BEARDED IF

YOU LIKE, RATHER THAN JUST

WHITE BEARDED AND TURBANED.

THERE WAS A TIME, OBVIOUSLY,

WHEN IT WAS VERY TERRIFYING TO

LIVE IN IRAN.

I CAN TELL THAT BECAUSE OF A

FRIEND OF MINE WHO RUNS A

BOOKSTORE.

HE'S A BIG, TOUGH GUY.

HEAVYSET, BRILLIANT

INTELLECTUAL, KURDISH, STRONG

FELLOW, BUT EVERY TIME ANYONE

WITH A BEARD CAME INTO HIS

SHOP, THERE WAS A FLINCH IN HIS

EYES.

AND HE WOULD ACT NERVOUSLY AND

SOMETIMES HIDE A BOOK UNDER THE

DESK.

OR HE WOULD--

HE WASN'T ALL THAT TERRIFIED

WHEN I SAW HIM, BUT YOU COULD

TELL HE WAS A MAN WHO HAD LIVED

UNDER A REIGN OF TERROR.

WHEN YOU'VE MET SOMEONE WHO'S

BEEN THROUGH THAT YOU'LL

ALWAYS BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE THE

SYMPTOMS.

IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY BAD.

I KNOW THIS IS TRUE, ALSO, FROM

FEMALE FRIENDS OF MINE, WHO

WERE TERRIFIED THAT IF THEY LET

ONE STRAND OF HAIR SHOW UNDER

THEIR HIJAB, THEY WOULD HAVE

ACID THROWN IN THEIR FACE, OR

PERHAPS BE BLINDED BY A BLOW

FROM A TRUNCHEON, EITHER FROM A

POLICEMAN OR FROM AN OVER

ENTHUSIASTIC CIVILIAN.

AND YOU CAN SEE THE FEAR IN

PEOPLE'S EYES THAT GOES ON FROM

THAT, TOO.

BUT THIS REALLY ISN'T HAPPENING

ANY MORE.

WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IRAN IS

VERY INTERESTING.

WITHIN THE CARAPACE OF THE THEOCRATIC

STATE, AN ALMOST COMPLETELY

SECULAR SOCIETY IS BEING

CREATED.

THIS IS FOR A GHOULISH REASON.

THE IRANIAN MULLAHS LOST SO

MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE

SUICIDE WAVES THAT THEY SENT

AGAINST SADAM HUSSEIN, THAT

THE SENDING OF GREAT GANGS OF

SCHOOL CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS

TO CLEAR MINE FIELDS, ON THE

IRAQI BORDER.

THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ROOM IN LARGE

PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, TO BURY

THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THEY KILLED.

IN LARGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY,

THERE IS ONE BIG CEMETERY.

THEY HAD LOST SO MANY YOUNG

PEOPLE, THAT THEY HAD TO PAY

IRANIAN MOTHERS INCENTIVES.

IF YOU WOULD AGREE TO HAVE

THREE OR MORE CHILDREN, YOU

COULD GET QUITE A LOT OF

SUBSIDY AND QUITE A LOT OF HELP

FROM THE REGIME.

THEY TRIED TO BREED QUICKLY A

NEW GENERATION, AS A

CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH -- IT

WORKED, IT WORKED OUT ALL

RIGHT, BUT NOT IN A WAY THEY

EXPECTED.

AS A CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH, IT'S

ESTIMATED MORE THAN HALF THE

POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY IS

UNDER 25, AND THEY ALL HATE THE

MULLAHS.

SO IT'S WHAT I CALL THE BABY

BOOMERANG.

  

\[Audience Laughter\]...

  

IN IRAN.

AND IF YOU WANT TO GET A DRINK,

WHICH, BELIEVE ME, I DID.

I FOUND A BOOTLEGGER AT THE

AIRPORT WHEN I ARRIVED, AS A

MATTER OF FACT.

IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO COME

ROUND TO YOUR HOTEL ROOM OR

YOUR APARTMENT, AND BRING

ANYTHING ELSE YOU MIGHT LIKE,

ANY OTHER FORM OF ALCOHOL OR

DRUGS OR PORNOGRAPHY OR ANY

OTHER KIND OF VIDEO OR

PUBLICATION, YOU CAN DO THAT

VERY SWIFTLY.

THE MULLAHS ARE POWERLESS TO

STOP IT -- THEY MAY EVEN, SOME

OF THEM, BE PROFITEERING FROM

SOME OF THIS ILLEGAL BLACK

MARKET THEMSELVES.

THERE IS A...

A TRADITION IN SHIA ISLAM,

VERY, VERY FIRMLY BELIEVED IN BY

THE DEVOUT, AND IT'S ONE OF THE

MANY WAYS IN WHICH SHIA ISLAM

IS QUITE LIKE ROMAN

CATHOLICISM.

IT HAS 12 IMAMS.

ONE OF THEM IS STILL ALIVE

SOMEWHERE, HE NEVER DIED.

HE'S NEVER LEFT THE EARTH, HE'S

NEVER LEFT US.

HE WILL COME BACK ONE DAY AND

THEN WE'LL KNOW.

WE WILL KNOW THAT THE REIGN OF

JUSTICE ON EARTH IS ABOUT TO

BEGIN.

SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT

KHOMEINI MIGHT BE THE 12th

IMAM, BUT HE WAS TOO PIUS A MAN

TO CLAIM IT.

IT'S VERY BLASPHEMOUS TO CLAIM

IT FOR YOURSELF.

AND IT MAY NOT BE A SHIA, IT

MAY NOT BE A PERSIAN, WE DON'T

KNOW, BUT THE HIDDEN IMAM, THEY

BELIEVE, IS SOMEWHERE.

WELL I OVERHEARD TWO TAXI

DRIVERS DISCUSSING, AND ONE OF

THEM SAID, "DO YOU THINK MAYBE

GEORGE BUSH IS THE 12th IMAM?"

NOW WHEN THINGS HAVE GONE THAT

FAR, THE AUTHORITY OF THE

MULLAHS I THINK, CAN BE SAID TO

HAVE BEEN FAIRLY FATALLY

UNDERMINED.

THESE DRIVERS WON'T STOP FOR

ANYONE WITH A TURBAN.

IT'S REMARKABLE TO SEE IT ON

THE STREET.

THESE GUYS JUST WAVE AND WAVE,

AND THE CABS GO STRAIGHT BY.

NO ONE WILL PICK THEM UP.

IT'S VERY WIDELY SAID, IT WAS

VERY WIDELY SAID TO ME, THAT

THEY WISHED THAT THERE WOULD BE

AN AMERICAN MILITARY

INTERVENTION.

IT WAS SAID TO ME MOST

MEMORABLY BY SOMEONE I KNOW

SLIGHTLY, HUSSEIN KHOMEINI, THE

GRANDSON OF THE AYATOLLAH

KHOMEINI, THE ONLY LIVING MALE

KHOMEINI IN HIS HOME, IN QUM.

HE SAID TO ME, WE WISH THAT

THERE WOULD BE AN INTERVENTION

TO REMOVE THE THEOCRACY.

YOU ASK, WELL SHOULD SAYEED

HUSSEIN KHOMEINI WANT TO REMOVE

THEOCRACY, HE'S A MULLAH.

IT'S BECAUSE HE'S A GENUINELY

BELIEVING AND DEVOUT SHIA

PERSON, AND A GREAT ADMIRER OF

GRAND AYATOLLAH SISTANI OF

NAJAF IN IRAQ, WHERE HE'S SPENT

A GOOD DEAL OF TIME LATELY.

AND HE BELIEVES IF IT GOES ON

THIS WAY, HIS RELIGION WILL BE

DISCREDITED.

AND THAT THE SHIA CAUSE WILL BE

DISFIGURED AND DEFAMED, AND

DISCREDITED BY

\[unintelligible\]

AND HE'S RIGHT.

IT'S LED TO THE MASS PRODUCTION

OF ATHEISM AMONG YOUNG

IRANIANS.

I SLIGHTLY HOPE IT GOES ON A

FEW MORE YEARS UNTIL THE JOB

GETS REALLY THOROUGHLY DONE,

BEFORE IT FALLS, WHICH IT WILL.

IF WE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH AN

ORDINARY TIMELINE FOR

OURSELVES, WE WOULD SAY, I

THINK, THAT WITHIN TEN YEARS,

THE GENERATION OF THE

DICTATORSHIP WILL DIE OUT, AND

WILL SOMEHOW BE REPLACED.

IT WILL BE AN ORGANIC, INTERNAL

ENDOGENOUS PROCESS OF SELF

TRANSFORMATION.

IN IRAN EVERYONE HAS A

SATELLITE DISH, ALMOST EVERYONE

HAS A RELATIVE OUTSIDE THE

COUNTRY.

PEOPLE TRAVEL, THEY ALL GET THE

NEWS.

THEY DON'T BOTHER WITH THE

OFFICIAL PROPAGANDA AT ALL.

AND THEY ARE READY TO VOTE, AND

WHEN THEY DO VOTE, THEY ALWAYS

VOTE AGAINST THE THEOCRACY.

IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S A

RESERVE GOVERNMENT, A SECRET

STATE WITHIN THE STATE THAT

DOES NOT ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO

TAKE POWER.

BUT UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN, THERE

IS ANOTHER TIME LINE THAT WE

CAN'T OVERLOOK, WHICH IS THE

SURREPTITIOUS ACQUISITION OF

WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

AND THE SPONSORSHIP OVERSEAS OF

RELIGIOUS GANGSTERISM.

AND IT'S NOT POSSIBLE, I THINK,

TO ALLOW OURSELVES, WITH ANY

INSOUCIANCE, TO SAY, WELL LET'S

HAVE ANOTHER 20 YEARS OF THAT

AS WELL, WHILE IT GRADUALLY

WEARS ITSELF OUT OF EXISTENCE.

SO ONCE AGAIN, WE'RE CONFRONTED

WITH UM... A PEOPLE WHO--

A GIFTED, TALENTED, USEFUL,

CIVILISED PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

DENIED ALL THEIR RIGHTS, BUT

WHO KNOW IT, BY A GOVERNMENT

WHO TRIES TO STAY IN POWER BY

MAKING THREATENING GESTURES

TOWARD ITS NEIGHBOURS AND

TOWARD THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

THIS DILEMMA IS EVIDENTLY NOT GOING

TO GO AWAY.

I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT

MIGHT BE DONE NEXT ABOUT ALL OF

THESE THINGS.

AND I THINK, PROBABLY THE

MOMENT HAS COME WHEN I'VE

SPOKEN ENOUGH IN MY OWN VOICE,

AND I WILL BE AS INTERESTED TO

HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE ANY

THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS AS I WOULD

BE WILLING AND EAGER TO TAKE

ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

SO... WITH THANKS VERY MUCH

AGAIN FOR COMING, UM...

I'M ALL YOURS -- THANK YOU.

  

\[Applause\]

  

Christopher says I WAS

ASKED TO CONFIRM THAT I'D HEARD

FROM MORE PEOPLE THAN I HAD NOT

HEARD FROM, THE REMARK THAT

THEY WOULD WELCOME IN IRAN, A

FOREIGN, A WESTERN, AN AMERICAN

INTERVENTION TO REMOVE THE

MULLOCRACY.

AND WHICH I CAN CONFIRM, YES,

THAT'S VERY COMMONLY SAID.

AND I WAS THEN ASKED, WELL

WOULD THAT NOT DESTROY THE

EMERGING DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION

THERE, WOULD IT NOT COMPROMISE IT?

THE ANSWER TO THAT IS PROBABLY

THAT IT WOULD.

I MEAN THERE ARE A LOT OF

PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY THINK --

ACTUALLY LET ME STEP A LITTLE

FURTHER BACK.

I HEARD THAT SAID SO OFTEN BY

PEOPLE, THAT AFTER A BIT, IT

STOPPED DELIGHTING ME.

IN OTHER WORDS, IN A WAY, IT'S

A CONFESSION OF WEAKNESS ON

THEIR PART, IT'S A CONFESSION

OF IMPOTENCE.

IT'S A SORT OF RESIGNATION, WE

CAN'T DO ANYTHING OURSELVES.

THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING SLIGHTLY

SERVILE ABOUT IT, AND A

MENTALITY OF THAT KIND, OF

COURSE, COULD TURN ON A DIME.

RIGHT AWAY IF THERE WAS AN

INVASION, IF THEY GOT WHAT THEY

WANTED, THEY WOULD SUDDENLY

SAY, DOWN WITH THE OCCUPATION,

TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN BE BRAVE

AFTER ALL.

AS HAS HAPPENED WITH QUITE A

NUMBER OF IRAQIS.

NOW THAT THEY CAN SHOW THEIR

COURAGE, THEY DO.

IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

SHAME THEY FEEL AT THEIR

COWARDICE AND CONFORMISM

BEFORE.

AND ONE DOESN'T WANT TO UPSET

THIS FEBRILE BALANCE TOO MUCH.

UM, AND ONE DOES HOPE TO

ENCOURAGE AN INTERNAL MOVEMENT.

BUT EVERY TIME AN INTERNAL

MOVEMENT HAS BEEN TRIED, IT HAS

BEEN VERY BRUTALLY PUT DOWN.

SO THAT GIVEN THE ODDS, GIVEN

THE VERY HEAVILY ARMED GOONS

WITH WHICH THE REGIME MAINTAINS

ITSELF, ONE IS CONDEMNING

PEOPLE TO A MUCH LONGER PERIOD

OF SERVITUDE.

AND ONE IS ALSO EXPOSING THE

INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO A

MUCH GREATER RISK OF YET-- OF A

PROMISCUOUS STATE WITH WEAPONS

OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

AND THEREFORE I THINK EVERYONE

HAS TO REASON IT, AND REALISE

THAT THERE ARE--

WE'RE ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY

EITHER WAY, AND THAT DOING

NOTHING IS ALSO A POLICY.

  

Now a clean-shaven man in his twenties from the audience speaks into a microphone and says

IF THE EU'S TALKS WITH

IRAN DON'T GO WELL, DO YOU SEE

ISRAEL INTERVENING

UNILATERALLY, LIKE THEY DID IN

IRAQ, OSIRAK, AND IF SO, WHAT

EFFECT DO YOU THINK THAT WILL

HAVE ON THE GROWING MOVEMENT

AGAINST THE MULLAHS IN IRAN?

  

Christopher says WELL

IT COULDN'T BE UNILATERAL, FOR

ONE THING, BECAUSE THEY WOULD

HAVE TO CROSS IRAQI AIR SPACE,

AND NO ONE WOULD THINK THAT

THAT WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT IRAQI

OR AMERICAN PERMISSION.

SO NO ONE COULD SAY, THAT WAS

THE ISRAELIS, WE DON'T KNOW

ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

IN ANY CASE, PEOPLE WHO THINK

LIKE THAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST,

REGARD ISRAEL AS AN AMERICAN

SURROGATE IN ANY CASE, SO...

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS

ISRAELI UNILATERALISM IN THIS

MATTER.

THE BEST EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE,

BUT I'M OPEN TO BE CHALLENGED

ABOUT THIS, IS THAT THE

ISRAELIS, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE

CONCLUDED THAT THE BOMBING OF

THE IRAQI REACTOR IN 82, I

THINK -- 81 -- I'VE JUST

FORGOTTEN THE NAME OF THE

REACTOR, DOESN'T MATTER.

OSIRAK -- O-CHIRAC, I CALL IT,

BECAUSE HE BUILT IT FOR SADDAM

HUSSEIN, KNOWING WHAT HE WANTED

IT FOR.

THERE'S ANOTHER UNILATERALIST

AT THE U.N. FOR YOU, BY THE

WAY.

UM... ONLY RETARDED, AND MAY

HAVE, IN SOME WAYS, ADVANCED

THE IRAQI NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

IT JUST DROVE IT FURTHER

UNDERGROUND.

I'VE HEARD MANY ISRAELIS SAY

THAT.

I'VE HEARD SOME OTHER EXPERTS

IN THE FIELD OF DISARMAMENT SAY

THAT -- GOOD SHOT THOUGH IT

WAS, IT DIDN'T REALLY DE-

NUCLEARIZE IRAQ.

AND THE IRANIANS, IN ANY CASE,

AS WE ALL KNOW NOW, HAVE

CONFIGURED THEMSELVES SO THAT

IT WILL BE MUCH HARDER TO HAVE

THE CORE OF THEIR PROGRAM TAKEN

OUT IN ANY ONE PLACE, OR ON ANY

ONE DAY.

SO THAT'S WHY I INSIST ON THE

LINKAGE OF INTERNAL DEMOCRACY,

UM, AND THE EMANCIPATION WITH

THESE QUESTIONS.

THERE ARE ONLY TWO SERIOUS

COUNTRIES THAT HAVE EVER GOT

THIS NEAR TO GETTING A BOMB OR

GOT ONE, AND GIVEN IT UP, ARE

BRAZIL AND SOUTH AFRICA.

IN BOTH CASES AS A RESULT OF A

DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION THAT

REPLACED THE DICTATORSHIP THAT

EMBARKED ON THE PROGRAM.

AND SO, WHAT ONE HAS TO HOPE

FOR, I THINK IS THAT WE WILL

GET INTO A POSITION WHERE WE'LL

BE NEGOTIATING ON DISARMAMENT

WITH DEMOCRATIC IRANIANS, NOT

THEOCRATIC ONES.

SO NOW WHERE IRAN IS A POOR COUNTRY,

AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY

POOR IN THE OUTLYING PARTS OF

IT, BUT IT IS ENORMOUSLY MORE

DEVELOPED INFRASTRUCTURALLY

THAN IRAQ.

IT'S REALLY QUITE-- THE ROADS

ARE EXCELLENT, THE INTERNAL

AIRLINE TRAVEL IS VERY GOOD.

THE TRAFFIC JAMS IN TEHRAN

OFTEN GO ON FOR FOUR DAYS, BUT

THAT'S A SIGN THAT MOST PEOPLE

HAVE A CAR.

EVERYONE HAS SATELLITE DISHES

AND SO FORTH.

EVERYONE IS ACCUSTOMED, MORE OR

LESS, TO LIVING IN AN OPEN

SOCIETY.

ALMOST EVERYONE HAS A RELATIVE

IN A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.

THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN

ELECTIONS, IT'S JUST THAT THE

MULLOCRACY WON'T LET THE

WINNERS TAKE OFFICE.

SO ALL OF THAT WORK, SO TO

SPEAK, HAS BEEN DONE IN

ADVANCE, AND AS FAR AS I COULD

TELL, THERE'S NO SECTARIAN OR

CONFESSIONAL PROBLEM IN IRAN,

92 percent SHIA.

THERE ARE...

EVEN THE EXISTING THEOCRACY HAS

RESERVED SEATS FOR JEWS AND FOR

CHRISTIANS WHO ARE QUITE SMALL

BUT SIGNIFICANT MINORITIES,

MAINLY ARMENIAN, THE

CHRISTIANS, IN THE MAJLIS, IN

THE PARLIAMENT, RECOGNISED

THEIR RIGHTS, SO TO SPEAK, AT

LEAST ACKNOWLEDGED, IF NOT OBSERVED.

THERE'S CERTAINLY NO DISLIKE

FOR JEWS OR CHRISTIANS.

IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO BE A

MEMBER OF THE BA'HAI FAITH,

BECAUSE THAT'S POST-ISLAMIC,

NOT PRE, BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

THERE'S NOTHING OF THIS SORT.

THE KURDS ARE A VERY SMALL

MINORITY, THEY'RE NOT

SEPARATIST.

THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY FIGHTING

THERE FOR SOME TIME.

WHAT HAVE I LEFT OUT?

NOT EVERYONE IS--

EVERYONE SPEAKS THE SAME

LANGUAGE, EVERYONE SPEAKS FARSI.

NOT EVERYONE IS PERSIAN.

IT MAY BE AS MANY AS 30 percent IS

AZERI, NOT PERSIAN.

THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE, NOBODY

WOULD PULL A KNIFE OVER IT.

SO ALL YOU'D NEED TO DO, IF I

LOWER MY VOICE HERE, OKAY -- I

HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY ANY OF

THIS.

BUT ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS WHAT

A WOMAN IN A CHADOR SAID TO ME

IN ISFAHAN, THE ONLY WOMAN I

MET ACTUALLY IN A CHADOR, WHO

HATED THE REGIME SO MUCH THAT

SHE SAID, DO YOU THINK YOU

AMERICANS COULD COME AND ONLY

STAY FOR ABOUT A WEEK?

AND THEN GET OUT.

AND I THOUGHT, WELL WHAT A

BRILLIANT IDEA.

I'LL PASS IT ON, YOU KNOW.

SEVERAL OF THE IRANIAN

GOVERNMENT ARE WANTED MEN IN

EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE.

WE KNOW THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE

WHO SENT OUT THESE DEATH SQUADS

TO BERLIN AND ELSEWHERE.

GO AND ARREST THEM -- YOU'RE

NICKED, THE REST OF YOU, UP

AGAINST THE WALL.

WE'RE GOING TO BLOW UP THAT

TUNNEL THAT YOU THOUGHT WE

WOULDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT IN THE

MOUNTAIN NEAR ISFAHAN, AND A

COUPLE OF OTHER PLACES WE DON'T

LIKE THE LOOK OF, BECAUSE YOU

KNOW, WE'VE FOUND OUT YOU CAN

ONLY REALLY INSPECT A COUNTRY

BY REALLY PAYING IT A PROPER VISIT.

AND THEN WE RETURN THE COUNTRY

TO ITS PEOPLE AND GO HOME.

THINK ABOUT IT.

AND THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE

THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THINKING

ABOUT.

I DON'T KNOW THAT THE UNITED

STATES IS THINKING ABOUT THIS,

BUT A LOT OF IRANIANS ARE

THINKING ABOUT IT.

THERE WOULDN'T NEED TO BE THIS

STEWARDSHIP, GUARDIANSHIP,

WARDSHIP, THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE AFTER WHAT

THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH.

  

Another clean-shaven man from the audience, in his thirties, says

AROUND THE TIME OF THE

FIRST GULF WAR, YOU WROTE AN

ESSAY WHERE YOU DESCRIBED U.S.

POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS

MUTUALLY CERTAIN

DESTABILISATION.

DO YOU SEE THE INVASION OF IRAQ

AS -- LIKE THE ULTIMATE

REPUDIATION OF THAT POLICY?

A REVERSAL WHERE NOW THE U.S.

IS LOOKING TO CREATE STABILISATION?

  

Christopher says WELL I WOULD--

IT WOULD BE NICE, IN A WAY, TO

SAY THAT, AND IT WOULD BE

SYMMETRICAL, BUT NOT QUITE.

I THINK WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO

WAS THE WAY THE UNITED STATES

SORT OF MANAGED TO BE ON BOTH

SIDES OF THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, AND

WHERE DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THE

ADMINISTRATION WERE DEALING

WITH IT COVERTLY AS WELL, AND

ARMING BOTH SIDES.

AND I HAD THE FEELING THAT AS

WELL AS THAT ELEMENT OF

PROFITEERING, THERE WAS ALSO A

KISSINGERIAN MIND SET, IN FACT

HENRY KISSINGER DID MORE OF

LESS SAY, HEY, THIS IS A GREAT

WAR, I WISH THEY COULD BOTH

LOSE.

THAT WAS HIS COMMENT ON THIS

WAR THAT KILLED, PERHAPS 2

MILLION PEOPLE.

AND YOU KNOW, IT WAS SEEING TWO

ENEMIES GO AT EACH OTHER, WHICH

WAS OF COURSE, WHY EVERYONE,

MORE OR LESS EVERYONE IN IRAN

BELIEVES THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN

WAS INSTIGATED BY THE UNITED

STATES TO ATTACK, WHICH, IS

ACTUALLY A HALF TRUTH, A BIT

MORE THAN HALF TRUTH.

SO YES, THIS POLICY IS PARTLY--

WE HAVE TO UNDERTAKE IT BECAUSE

OF THE FAILURES OF THE PREVIOUS

ONE, BECAUSE THAT WAS SUCH A

DISASTROUS POLICY, AND SECOND,

WE OUGHT TO PUT RIGHT SOME OF

WHAT WE DID.

BUT I CAN'T EXACTLY SAY THAT

IT'S A STABILISING UM...

POLICY, BECAUSE IN ONE WAY, IT

WAS TO SAY THAT THE STATUS QUO

OF THE MIDDLE EAST SHOULD BE

OVERTURNED.

THAT'S WHY I FEEL THAT SOME OF

MY FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON ARE

UNJUSTLY REFERRED TO AS

NEOCONSERVATIVES.

IN OTHER WORDS, CONSERVATIVE,

THEY'RE NOT AT ALL.

THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ALL SAID

NO, WHO DON'T LIKE THE STATUS

QUO, WHO DON'T LIKE THE WAY

THINGS ARE, WHO ARE WILLING TO

TAKE THE RISK OF DESTABILISING

IT, BECAUSE WE'RE SURE THE

ALTERNATIVE WILL BE BETTER.

THAT'S NOT REALLY A

CONSERVATIVE POSITION.

THE CONSERVATIVE POSITION WAS

TAKEN BY GEORGE BUSH SENIOR, BY

LAWRENCE EAGLEBERGER, AND BRENT

SCOWCROFT AND SOME OF THE

SENIOR STATESMEN, GROUPS

USUALLY AROUND HENRY KISSINGER,

WHO HAD A REAL-POLITIK VIEW

OF THE WORLD WHICH SAYS, NO, WE

LIKE TO TREAT THE REGION AS IF

IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD

RULE THROUGH PROXY DICTATORS.

AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH

ABOUT THE OPINIONS OF THE

UNWATCHED.

  

Now a woman from the audience in her thirties says

WHAT DO YOU SEE HAPPENING IN IRAQ OVER THE NEXT

FIVE YEARS?

  

Christopher says WELL...

IT WAS INTERESTING, WHEN I ASKED

IRANIANS WHAT THEY THOUGHT

ABOUT THE IRAQI ELECTIONS AND

THE PROCESS THERE, FOR THE MOST

PART THEY PRETENDED A SORT OF

INDIFFERENCE.

THIS COMES LARGELY FROM THE FEELING

THAT, DON'T TALK TO US AS IF WE

WERE ARABS.

VERY STRONG FEELING THEY RESENT

VERY MUCH BEING THOUGHT OF AS

ARABS.

DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THEY HAVE

ANYTHING TO LEARN FROM AN ARAB

MODEL OF ANY KIND.

AND REGARD IRAQ NOT AS A

NATION, BUT AS A STATE, AS A

RECENTLY COBBLED TOGETHER

POLITICAL ENTITY, NOT THE

WONDERFUL MILLENNIAL, HIGHLY

EVOLVED CIVILISATION LIKE THE

PERSIAN ONE WHICH IS 2,000 OR

MORE YEARS OLD.

I MENTION THAT BECAUSE OF

COURSE, THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH

IRAQ IS PRECISELY THAT.

IT ISN'T REALLY A COUNTRY.

THERE IS IRAQI NATIONALISM,

THOUGH, AND WHAT'S GOING TO

HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS

IS A COMPETITION BETWEEN THAT

FEELING OF NATIONALISM AND

OTHER FEELINGS OF NATIONAL,

ETHNIC OR CONFESSIONAL

ALLEGIANCE.

I DON'T THINK IT'S AT ALL

OBVIOUS THAT THERE WON'T BE A

COMPROMISE, A FEDERAL

COMPROMISE ABOUT THAT.

THE ONE REASON I BELIEVE IT IS

BECAUSE THE GROUPS ARE FAIRLY

EVENLY MATCHED, THE KURDS, WHO

ARE SUNNI ARE ABOUT 20 percent.

NO ONE IS EVERY GOING TO TRY

AND RULE THEM BY FORCE AGAIN,

AND THEY ALSO HAVE AN ARMY OF

THEIR OWN, NOW.

THEY CAN'T-- NO ONE'S EVER

GOING TO BE ABLE TO BULLY THEM

AGAIN.

THE SAME IS MORE OR LESS TRUE

OF THE SHIA, AND THE NUMBERS OF

THE SUNNI ARE TOO LARGE TO

ALLOW THEM TO BE TREATED AS A

DESPISED MINORITY ALSO.

THAT'S THE FIRST THING.

THE SECOND IS, I HAVE NEVER MET

AN IRAQI WHO IS 100 percent SHIA,

SUNNI OR KURDISH.

THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE.

I HAVE MET SOME KURDS WHO

HARDLY HAVE ANY NON-KURDISH

RELATIVES, BECAUSE THERE'S

BEEN--

KURDISTAN WAS GOVERNED

SEPARATELY, AS YOU KNOW, UNDER

THE NO FLY ZONES, IT WASN'T

RULED BY SADDAM HUSSEIN, IT

WASN'T PART OF IRAQ FOR THE

LAST FEW YEARS.

BUT OTHERWISE, IT'S THE

STANDARD RULE, YOU MEET SOMEONE

IN BAGHDAD, THEY ASK YOU TO

DINNER, AND YOU MEET THEIR

KURDISH BROTHER-IN-LAW, AND

THEIR SHIA AUNTIE AND SO FORTH.

THAT'S IRAQ 101, IT'S THE

REASON THAT MOST OF THE

PREDICTIONS ABOUT CIVIL WAR

HAVE NOT PROVEN TO BE TRUE, AND

WHY THERE'S BEEN SO LITTLE

INDIVIDUAL FRATRICIDE IN THE

COUNTRY OR REVENGE TAKING.

SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK WILL

HAPPEN.

I THINK IT WILL TAKE--

I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL TAKE

FIVE YEARS TO DESTROY THE

INSURGENCY, I THINK IT WILL

PROBABLY TAKE LESS TIME THAN

THAT, BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON A

MINORITY OF A MINORITY.

IT DOESN'T HAVE A STATE THAT

CAN RE-SUPPLY IT, IT'S

OPERATING ON THE STOLEN

RESOURCES OF THE PREVIOUS

REGIME.

AND BECAUSE IT'S LINKED TO

ANOTHER DOOMED ORGANISATION, AL

QAEDA, AND BECAUSE IT'S UP

AGAINST MILITARY SUPERIORITY OF

A KIND THAT YOU WOULDN'T

BELIEVE UNTIL YOU'VE ACTUALLY

SEEN IT.

THERE'S THE MOST OVER--

I DON'T KNOW WHY, IN FACT, IT'S

CALLED INSURGENCY AT ALL.

IT ANNOYS ME THAT SUCH A

FLATTERING TERM IS USED FOR

SUCH A SORDID AND UM...

EVIDENTLY SELF-DEFEATING OPERATION.

  

Now a caption appears on screen that reads "Didn't the invasion of Iraq inflame anti-American sentiments?"

  

Christopher says

YOU MAY KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T

ABOUT WHAT CAUSES ANTI-AMERICAN

FEELING, OR ANTI-WESTERN

FEELING IN THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT

I DON'T THINK IT'S MOST TO THE

INTERVENTION.

I THINK THAT'S GIVING A FREE PASS

TO THE AL QAEDA MENTALITY.

YOU SHOULD TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY,

YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT REALLY DOES

CONSTITUTE THEIR GRIEVANCE.

I CAN TELL YOU, WELL YOU KNOW

WHAT THEIR GRIEVANCE IS, WHAT

MAKES THEM ANGRY, WHAT MAKES

THEM WANT TO KILL.

THE SIGHT OF A FEMALE FACE, FOR

EXAMPLE, OR A SHIA MUSLIM, OR A

SYNAGOGUE, OR A SKYSCRAPER, OR

A CHRISTIAN OR A HINDU,

PARTICULARLY THE HINDUS, THAT'S

WHAT MAKES THEM ANGRY.

NOW I'M SORRY, I HAVE NO

PATIENCE WHATEVER, OR AT ALL,

WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT WHAT

BRINGS THEM ABOUT IS RESISTANCE

TO THEM.

FOR ONE THING IT'S NOT TRUE,

FOR ANOTHER, IT EUPHEMISES

THEIR ACTUAL PROPAGANDA, WHICH

I'VE JUST DELINEATED FOR YOU,

WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS

Unarguable.

YOU CAN READ FOR

YOURSELF WHAT THEIR COMPLAINT IS.

AND FOR THE THIRD, WOULD HAVE

TO MEAN SURRENDER.

IF RESISTING THEM ONLY MAKES

THEM MORE ACTIVE, THEN WE MIGHT

AS WELL GIVE UP NOW.

THEY'VE WON, HAVEN'T THEY?

WELL THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WIN,

AND THEIR POPULAR BASE IS GOING

TO BE TESTED FOR THEM.

THEY DIDN'T EVEN RUN IN THE

AFGHAN ELECTIONS, AND I COULD

TELL YOU WHAT WOULD HAVE

HAPPENED TO THEM IF THEY DID.

THEY DIDN'T TRY TO RUN IN IRAQ,

BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WOULD

HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY DID.

THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RUN IN THE

LEBANESE ONES, AND I CAN TELL

YOU WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY DID.

WHY ARE YOU BEING A

VENTRILOQUIST FOR THEM AND

SAYING THAT THEIR APPEAL IS

GROWING, AND WHY DO YOU IMPLY

THAT IT'S THE RESISTANCE TO

THIS FASCISM THAT BRINGS IT ABOUT?

THIS IS DEFEAT IN THE MIND.

DROP IT, I WOULD, I'D STOP

SAYING THAT.

  

\[Applause\]

  

Now a clean-shaven and bald man in his late fifties says

I DIDN'T HEAR YOUR

ENTIRE LECTURE, SO I DON'T KNOW

IF YOU DISCUSSED SYRIA AT ANY POINT.

  

Christopher says NO,

BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO.

  

The man continues

OKAY, THEY'RE KIND OF A

QUESTION MARK TO ME, BECAUSE I

HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT

THEY'RE BASICALLY A SECULAR

GOVERNMENT, AND UM...

I WOULDN'T SEE THEM AS A NATION

THAT WOULD BE PART OF A

MOVEMENT TO BE YOU KNOW,

ESPOUSING AND SERVING AN

ISLAMIC TYPE MOVEMENT AROUND

THE WORLD, BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS

BEING ACCUSED OF HARBOURING

INSURGENTS.

YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ACCUSED OF

HARBOURING IRAQI INSURGENTS AND

HELPING THEM TRAIN AND SO FORTH.

  

Christopher says YEAH.

  

The man concludes

AND ALSO THIS ISSUE

WITH LEBANON.

I DON'T REMEMBER HEARING

ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, AND ALL OF

A SUDDEN, NOW THEY HAVE TO

LEAVE LEBANON IMMEDIATELY.

I KIND OF DON'T UNDERSTAND

WHAT'S UP WITH THAT.

  

Christopher says RIGHT,

WELL JUST FOR A START, A WORD

ON THIS BA'ATHIST SECULAR

QUESTION, WHICH COMES UP A LOT.

THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU HAVE

TO BEAR IN MIND IF YOU'RE GOING

TO SAY THIS IS A SECULAR POLICY.

THE FIRST IS THAT IT'S EXPLICITLY

BASED, AND YOU CAN LOOK AT--

YOU CAN LOOK UP, AS I HAVE, THE

ORIGINAL WRITINGS OF THE

FOUNDERS AND INSPIRERS OF THE

BA'ATH PARTY.

THEY HAVE MODELLED THEMSELVES

BASICALLY ON EUROPEAN FASCISM.

I DON'T THINK EUROPEAN FASCISM

WAS A CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT,

EXACTLY, THOUGH IT DID HAVE THE

SUPPORT OF THE VATICAN.

I DON'T THINK-- I THINK IT'S A

BIT MUCH TO CALL IT SECULAR,

SOMEHOW.

BUT IT'S ONLY IN THAT SENSE AT

ANY RATE, THAT ONE CAN CALL IT

SECULAR.

IT PROPOSES, INSTEAD, THE

WORSHIP OF THE STATE, THE PARTY

AND THE LEADER.

AND IT CERTAINLY-- IT'S NOT

AGAINST RELIGION IN THE LEAST.

IN IRAQ, THE SADDAM HUSSEIN

REGIME, IN ITS CLOSING 15

YEARS, MUTATED COMPLETELY INTO

AN ISLAMIST REGIME.

IT CHANGED ALL OF ITS RHETORIC

TO JIHADISM, IT BEGAN TO BUILD

SPENT A FORTUNE BUILDING

MOSQUES, INCLUDING THE LARGEST

MOSQUE IN THE WORLD, THE SADDAM

HUSSEIN MOSQUE, PROFANELY

NAMED, THE CENTREPIECE A KORAN,

A MINIATURE KORAN, WRITTEN IN

HIS OWN BLOOD.

I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS HIS OWN

BLOOD, IT'S BLOOD ALL RIGHT,

THOUGH.

HE WAS-- AS THE PICTURES AND

STATUES OF HIM STARTED TO TAKE

THE FORM OF SHOWING HIM IN

CLERICAL ROBES, THE VERSE OF

THE-- NOT THE VERSE OF THE

KORAN, BUT THE UH...

SLOGAN

\[unintelligible\]

WAS PUT ON

THE IRAQI FLAG, WHERE IT HAD

NEVER BEEN BEFORE.

AND THEY WERE SPONSORING, ALL

OVER THE WORLD, ISLAMIST, NOT

SECULAR MOVEMENTS.

KNOWN NOTABLY, SUPPORTING THE

ISLAMIC JIHAD FORCES IN

PALESTINE AGAINST THE SECULAR

PLO, AND PAYING -- SADDAM

HUSSEIN, PAYING PERSONALLY, FOR

EVERY SUICIDE BOMBER, WHO WAS

KNOWN AS A MARTYR IN THE, JUST

AS THE NUCLEAR SCIENTISTS IN

IRAQ WERE CALLED IN THE

BA'ATHIST PRESS, OUR NUCLEAR

MUJAHIDIN, WHICH IS A

WONDERFUL EXPRESSION, I THINK

YOU'LL HAVE TO AGREE.

AND IT WAS BASED ON THE TRIBAL

MINORITY OF THE SUNNI.

NOW OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE WHO

DOESN'T WANT MAJORITY RULE,

WHEN THE MAJORITY IS SHIA

MUSLIM, HAS EVERY REASON TO

PRETEND TO BE A SECULARIST, AND

NOT SAY ANYTHING--

OH, I'M NOT A SECTARIAN, IT'S

NOT THAT I WANT TO PROTECT MY

OWN SUNNI MUSLIM TRIBE.

BUT DON'T BE FOOLED BY THIS,

AND DON'T BE FOOLED BY SYRIA,

EITHER.

THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS A

COMPLETELY RELIGIOUS REGIME.

IT'S BASED ON THE ALAWITE

MINORITY, WHICH IS A VERY SMALL

MINORITY IN SYRIA.

IT'S A RELIGIOUS CLAN.

IT RULES, THAT'S NOT SECULAR.

IF YOU WANT ME TO SAY THAT

ALAWISM IS, I CAN'T TELL YOU

ONLY THAT REALLY IT IS A UM...

A FORM, A VARIANT OF SHIA

ISLAM.

OR THE INDIVIDUALISED FORM OF

IT.

BUT THIS MINORITY RULE IN SYRIA

IS BREAKING UP AND HASN'T LONG

TO LAST, BUT WHILE IT DOES

LAST, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

IT SPONSORS WHAT YOU SAY IT

DOES NOT SPONSOR, CLERICAL

TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD.

ITS MAIN ALLY IS IRAN, IT'S

MAIN TRADING PARTNER AND

ARMOURER IS IRAN.

IT'S JUST MADE A FORMAL

MILITARY AGREEMENT WITH IRAN,

AND WITH IRAN, IT CO-SPONSORS

HEZBOLLAH, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE,

CONVENIENTLY, A PRO-SYRIAN

PARTY IN IT'S CURRENTLY THE

CURRENT CRISIS IN LEBANON,

WHERE, YOU SAY, WHERE HAS THIS

ALL COME FROM, WHY HAVE THEY

SUDDENLY BEEN TOLD TO GET OUT

OF LEBANON?

WELL BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF

LEBANON HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT,

BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ELECTION

COMING -- THERE IS ONE COMING

IN MAY, BECAUSE A FORCE WAS

BEING PUT TOGETHER OUT OF

DIVERSE GROUPS, THE DRUZE LED

BY THE SOCIALIST PARTY LEADER,

WALID JUMBLAT, MANY OF THE

SUNNI, THE CHRISTIAN --

PROBABLY MAJORITY IN LEBANON,

AND OTHERS.

AND MR. RAFIK HARIRI WAS GOING

TO JOIN THIS COALITION, AND IF

HE HAD DONE SO, IT WOULD HAVE

BEEN VERY HARD FOR IT NOT TO

WIN.

SO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS

EVER CRITICISED SYRIAN RULE IN

LEBANON, HE'S BEEN MURDERED.

I DON'T SAY THE SYRIANS DID IT,

I SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS

HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO CRITICISE

SYRIAN RULE.

THOSE ARE THE FACTS. THAT'S

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PREVIOUS

HEAD OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY,

KAMAL JUMBLAT.

THAT'S, I THINK WHY YOU'LL FIND

THAT SUDDENLY, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

IN A WAY THAT SEEMS TO HAVE

UPSET YOU, I'M SORRY, THEY'VE

BEEN TOLD THEIR TIME IN LEBANON

IS UP, AND THEY SHOULD GO, AS

THEY SHOULD.

  

Now a clean-shaven man in his late twenties says

A WEEK AGO, RUSSIA

PROCEEDED WITH ITS AGREEMENT

WITH IRAN TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

ENRICHED URANIUM.

THEY'RE ALSO SUPPLYING MID-

RANGE MISSILES TO SYRIA, AND

THIS IS ALL FOLLOWING A BRIEF

MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT A

ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO IN EUROPE.

THERE'S CRITICISM ON BOTH SIDES

OF THE AISLE, THAT THE

PRESIDENT BLINKED, DURING THIS

MEETING, AND I WAS HOPING TO

GAUGE YOUR THOUGHT AND OPINION

ON WHERE ARE THE U.S. RELATIONS

HEADING WITH RUSSIA,

PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO

THE MIDDLE EAST, AND

ESSENTIALLY, WHAT ARE WE

LOOKING AT?

ARE WE AGAIN LOOKING AT A STARE

DOWN WITH RUSSIA, OR DO YOU

HOPE THAT THIS SITUATION WILL

COME AROUND BECAUSE THE

SENTIMENT IS--

FOR DEMOCRACY IS TOO GREAT?

  

Christopher says THE

STUPIDEST THINK, I THINK, THAT

GEORGE BUSH HAS EVER SAID --

SOME MIGHT LAUGH, AT THIS POINT

AND SAY, HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING

TO GO ON BEFORE YOU PICK ONE,

BUT ACTUALLY I THINK HE SAID

MANY QUITE SHREWD THINGS,

INCLUDING ABOUT THE AXIS OF

EVIL.

AFTER ALL, THINK ABOUT WHAT

WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT JUST

NOW.

WHO SAYS HE WASN'T RIGHT TO

CALL THAT AN AXIS OF EVIL --

NOBODY SAYS THAT NOW.

EVERYTHING WE'VE FOUND OUT

ABOUT THESE COUNTRIES IS MUCH

WORSE THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT.

FOR MOST PEOPLE TO FIND OUT, ANYWAY.

HOWEVER, I SHOULD SAY, THE

STUPIDEST THING THE PRESIDENT

SAID WAS, AS SOON AS HE SAW

THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS WEARING

A CRUCIFIX AROUND HIS NECK, HE

KNEW HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD BE

TRUSTED.

  

\[Audience Laughter\]

  

Christopher shakes his shirt and continues I HAVE GARLIC UNDER THIS UH...

IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING.

AND HE LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE,

AND HE KNEW HE WAS A GREAT MAN.

I MEAN, I THOUGHT, OH GOD.

THAT'S WHAT-- THAT REALLY IS

WHAT YOU GET IF YOU'RE FAITH

BASED.

YOU GET A KGB WEASEL AS YOUR

PARTNER, AND IT'S TOO LATE TO

SAY THAT YOU THINK HE'S NO

GOOD, AFTER YOU'VE ENDORSED HIM

IN THAT MANNER.

NOW SINCE THAT TIME, MR. PUTIN

INTERVENED OUTRAGEOUSLY IN THE

ATTEMPT OF THE PEOPLE OF

UKRAINE TO MAKE A SELF

DETERMINING GOVERNMENT OF THEIR

OWN.

I DO NOT BELIEVE, I SAY IT

FLATLY -- I DO NOT BELIEVE

ANYONE IN THE UKRAINIAN KGB

WOULD HAVE DARED TO TRY TO

POISON THE OPPOSITION LEADER IF

THEY THOUGHT THE RUSSIANS

DIDN'T KNOW, OR MIGHT

DISAPPROVE.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THAT

MILIEU, FOR THE APPROVAL OF

PUTIN TO AT LEAST NEGATIVELY,

NOT TO HAVE BEEN SOUGHT, AND I

THINK THAT QUESTION MUST BE

ASKED MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVELY

THAN IT HAS BEEN.

MR. PUTIN'S POLICY OF

UNILATERALISM IN RESPECT OF

IRAQ, AT THE UNITED NATIONS,

PUTTING RUSSIAN INTERESTS, OR

THE INTERESTS ACTUALLY, OF A

CLAN OF SOVIET--

FORMER SOVIET MOBSTERS WHO ARE

OWED A LOT OF MONEY BY SADDAM'S

REGIME AND WHO WERE TRADING ON

THE OIL FOR FOOD PROGRAM, WHICH

IS LARGELY RUN THROUGH RUSSIA,

WAS SCANDALOUS.

THAT'S UNILATERALISM AT THE

U.N., NOT WHAT THE UNITED

STATES WAS DOING, WHICH WAS

TRYING TO GET THE EXISTING

RESOLUTIONS ENFORCED.

UM... AND YES, NOW SYRIA AND

NOW IRAN, AND VERY UNHELPFUL

ABOUT NORTH KOREA, TOO, AND

DRAGGING THEIR FEET ON AN

AGREEMENT WE'VE HAD FOR A LONG

TIME, LIKE-- I'M SORRY I KEEP

SAYING "WE."

I WAS IN AMERICA THIS MORNING,

AND I'LL BE THERE AGAIN

TOMORROW.

YOU'LL PARDON THAT.

TO BUILD DOWN THE EXISTING

NUCLEAR STOCKS, A LOT OF WHICH

ARE STILL TARGETED AT US ALL,

STILL IN THE SILOS.

THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE

YEARS AGO, AND IT HASN'T BEEN.

AND THIS IS TO SAY NOTHING

ABOUT HOW HE DOESN'T LET THE

RUSSIANS TO INTERFERE IN THEIR

OWN INTERNAL AFFAIRS, WHICH HE

DOES NOT.

I MEAN HE'S QUITE CLEARLY

EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF ONE MAN

AND ONE PARTY RULE FOR HIS OWN

COUNTRY.

SO THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

AND IT SHOWS THAT THERE HAS

BEEN A GREAT RUSSIAN CHAUVINIST

RESENTMENT, EVER SINCE THE

EVENTS OF 1989.

THE FEELING THAT THEY ARE ON

THE LOSING SIDE, AND THAT THEY

ARE BECOMING A VICTIM COUNTRY.

THIS, I THINK, IS INCALCULABLY DANGEROUS.

  

A clean-shaven man in his fifties says

YOU MENTIONED THREE

VERY REPRESSIVE REGIMES, OF

WHICH, ONE, THE UNITED STATES

INTERVENED, IN IRAQ.

ARE YOU JUSTIFYING ALSO THAT

THE UNITED STATES OR WHOEVER,

SHOULD ALSO INVADE IRAN, NORTH

KOREA, AND ON THAT BASIS, IF

YOUR ANSWER IS YES, WHO BECOMES

THE ARBITER, AND WHAT IS THE

CRITERIA THEN, FOR NOT INVADING

SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, WHATEVER

REPRESSIVE REGIME.

  

Christopher says IF YOU

RETURN ME TO THE QUESTION OF UM...

  

\[Speaking Latin\]

  

Christopher continues BY WHAT RIGHT, WHICH MUST BE

ASKED OF EVERYTHING.

AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE FOUR

CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH A

GOVERNMENT CAN BE SAID TO HAVE

SACRIFICED ITS SOVEREIGNTY, AND

TO HAVE PUT ITSELF OUTSIDE OF

INTERNATIONAL LAW SUCH THAT THE

UNITED NATIONS CAN CONTEMPLATE

REMOVING SUCH A GOVERNMENT, OR

INTERVENING IN ITS INTERNAL

AFFAIRS AT LEAST.

THESE FOUR ARE THE FOLLOWING.

INVASION OR INVASIONS OF

NEIGHBOURING STATES, OR

OCCUPATIONS OF NEIGHBOURING

STATES, UM, VIOLATION OF THE

GENOCIDE CONVENTION, WHICH

MANDATES ACTION BOTH TO PREVENT

AND TO PUNISH IT, BY ALL THE

SIGNATORY POWERS, OF WHICH

CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES

ARE... ONE, TWO.

VIOLATIONS OF THE TREATY ON

NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION, NPT,

AND SPONSORSHIP OF

INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.

ANY OF THOSE FOUR QUALIFY YOU

TO ASK-- FOR ANY MEMBER OF THE

SECURITY COUNCIL TO ASK THE

UNITED NATIONS TO CONSIDER

TAKING ACTION.

WELL WITH IRAQ, THAT'S EASY.

ALL OF THOSE FOUR VIOLATED

REPEATEDLY, SERIALLY,

FLAGRANTLY.

GOT AWAY WITH A LOT OF THEM.

SHOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN

ARRAIGNED EARLIER THAN THEY

WERE, BUT IRAQ WAS NOT A

SOVEREIGN COUNTRY IN 2003, IT

WAS UNDER INTERNATIONAL

SANCTIONS ALREADY.

LARGE PARTS OF ITS AIR SPACE

WERE PATROLLED BY AMERICAN AND

BRITISH PLANES.

IT DIDN'T REALLY HAVE CONTROL

OVER ITS OWN BORDERS, IT WAS AN

OUTLAW STATE IN LAW.

IRAN ONLY QUALIFIES UNDER TWO

OF THESE AT PRESENT, IT SEEMS

TO ME.

IT DOESN'T THREATEN ANY

NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY, UNLESS

YOU SAY THAT ITS ALLIANCE WITH

SYRIA HELPS PERPETUATE THE

OCCUPATION OF LEBANON,

TECHNICALLY IT DOES.

IT'S BEEN FOOLING AROUND WITH

THE NPT, BUT IT IS CONSTANTLY

IN NEGOTIATION, AND IT IS

SUBMITTING TO INSPECTIONS, AND

IT DOES SPONSOR INTERNATIONAL

TERRORISM, BUT I WOULD SAY IN

THE MOST AMBIGUOUS FORM, IN

THAT HEZBOLLAH IS NOT LIKE AL

QAEDA OR ISLAMIC JIHAD.

HEZBOLLAH IS A SHIA POLITICAL

MOVEMENT WITH A MILITARY WING,

AND IT'S THE WOULD-BE--

THERE WOULD BE SOME ARGUMENT IN

THE UNITED NATIONS, I THINK

THERE SHOULD BE, AS TO WHETHER

IT QUALIFIES AS A TERRORIST

ORGANISATION, PURELY AND

SIMPLY.

I WOULD SAY THAT IT DID NOT.

SO THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT.

NORTH KOREA COMMITS GENOCIDE

ONLY AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE,

NOT OTHERS, BUT IT DOES DO

THAT.

IT'S A POLITICAL POLICY OF

STARVATION.

IT'S IN FLAGRANT BREACH OF ALL

AGREEMENTS ON NON-NUCLEAR

WEAPONS, AND IT PLANS TO INVADE

SOUTH KOREA.

IT MAINTAINS ITSELF ON INVASION

FOOTING AT ALL TIMES.

UM... SO YOU WOULD BE AS GOOD A

JUDGE AS I, BUT THESE ARE THE

CRITERIA.

AND AS YOU'LL SEE, IT SHOULD

GET PEOPLE TO STOP DOING THIS

RATHER ANNOYING THING.

WHENEVER ONE MAKES A CASE

AGAINST SADDAM HUSSEIN AS

CAREFULLY AS ONE CAN, THEY SAY,

WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO AND

INVADE ROBERT MUGABE, THEN?

I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT.

DON'T DO IT, PLEASE, DON'T DO THAT.

  

Now a man in his twenties with short black hair and a stubble says

IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

THAT BACK IN 1920s, WHEN IBN

BIN SAUD WAS TRYING TO CREATE

HIS PERSONAL STATE, IMPOSED ON

ARABIA, HE MADE A DEAL WITH

WAHABIISTS SAYING THAT IF YOU

SUPPORT MY POLITICAL AGENDA TO

CREATE THE STATE OF SAUDI

ARABIA, I'LL SUPPORT YOU IN

YOUR EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND

ALLOW A SENSE OF FREE REIGN

WITHIN MY TERRITORY.

NOW FAST FORWARD TO 2005, NOW

YOU HAVE AL QAEDA AND ALL THESE

GROUPS THAT SPRING FROM

WAHABIISM, AND YOU HAVE THE

UNITED STATES THAT'S NOW

PRESSURING AUTOCRATIC REGIMES

IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO

DEMOCRATISE, AND MY SPECIFIC

QUESTION IS THIS.

IS IT STILL IN THE HOUSE OF

SAUD'S BEST INTEREST TO SUPPORT

WAHABIISTS AND THEIR

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WITHIN

SAUDI ARABIA, ESSENTIALLY THEIR

DOMESTIC FORCES, OR IS IT NOW

THAT, TO USE A TOTALLY

POLITICALLY INCORRECT TERM,

THEY FEEL THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE

MADE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL IN

THAT NOW THEY'RE HAVING ALL

THESE PRESSURES FROM THE UNITED

STATES, AND THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY

WALKING A TIGHTROPE?

SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW YOUR

ANSWER ON THAT.

  

Christopher says UH,

ANYWAY, I DON'T THINK THERE'S

ANYTHING POLITICALLY INCORRECT

IN SAYING, "DEAL WITH THE DEVIL."

YOUR ANALYSIS OF IT IS, AS FAR

AS I CAN SEE, FLAWLESS.

AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY

WHAT DID HAPPEN, AND IT'S ALSO

THE QUESTION THAT THEY ARE

GOING TO CONFRONT, IS IT WORTH

IT, BECAUSE THEY'VE INVESTED

BILLIONS OF THEIR PETRO-DOLLARS

IN CREATING MADRASAS FOR THE

INCULCATION OF A VERY

FUNDAMENTALIST VERSION OF THE

KORAN -- IN INDONESIA, IN

ALGERIA, IN SOME PARTS OF

TURKEY, AND AFRICA, NIGERIA,

WHICH I THINK IS THE NEXT PLACE

WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE A

CONFRONTATION OF THIS KIND, BY

THE WAY.

WE SHOULD BE PAYING A LOT MORE

ATTENTION TO NIGERIA THAN WE

ARE DOING.

AND ALSO IN THE UNITED STATES

AND CANADA, WHERE VERY OFTEN

NOW, THE WAHABI VERSION OF THE

BIBLE, WHICH EXPLICITLY -- THE

KORAN, THE HOLY BOOK, WHICH

EXPLICITLY ENDORSES AND CALLS

FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST

UNBELIEVERS, IS BEING USED BY

IMAMS IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM.

I MEAN, LET'S NOT MINCE WORDS

HERE, THERE'S AN ATTEMPT BEING

MADE TO BUILD A SECRET ARMY

WITHIN WESTERN SOCIETY OUT OF

CRIMINAL ELEMENTS, AND TO

SUPPLY IT FROM OUTSIDE, AND TO

KEEP IT, AND TO GIVE IT AN

IDEOLOGY THAT WOULD REALLY

DISCIPLINE IT.

AND THIS HAS TO BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY.

I THINK THAT THE BUSH

ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

HOPELESSLY LAGGARD ON THIS

QUESTION.

THE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER USED

THE WORD SAUDI ARABIA IN THE

SAME SENTENCE AS THE WORD

TERRORISM, AND HE'S USED THE

WORD TERRORISM A LOT NOW.

I THINK JUST BY CHURNING

AROUND, ONE DAY, THE WORD SAUDI

OUGHT TO TURN UP.

HE JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO DO IT.

HE'S USED IT IN CONJUNCTION

WITH ALMOST EVER OTHER WORD, SO

THAT HE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE

TOURISM NOW, WHEN HE SPEAKS, TO

HEAR HIM SAY, THE WAR ON

TOURISM.

  

\[Audience Laughter\]

  

Christopher continues WELL, WHICH I WISH ALSO WOULD

BREAK DOWN.

I THINK HE SHOULD SAY VERY

PLAINLY TO THEM THAT THERE WILL

BE NOT ONE MORE SCHOOL OR

INSTITUTION THAT IS OPENED WITH

SAUDI MONEY ON AMERICAN SOIL,

UNLESS CHURCHES, SYNAGOGUES,

SHIA MOSQUES, AND CENTRES OF

ATHEIST HUMANISM CAN BE LEGALLY

OPENED IN SAUDI ARABIA.

IF THEY DON'T SAY YES TO THAT,

IT'S OVER, FINISHED.

AND WORSE WILL FOLLOW.

BUT WE CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION

WHERE THEY ARE TRAINING

GUERRILLAS IN SCHOOLS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND IN PRISONS,

AND TRYING TO DO IT IN THE ARMY

UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE

FIRST AMENDMENT, AND IT'S

ILLEGAL TO BE A CHRISTIAN IN

SAUDI ARABIA, IT'S ILLEGAL TO

BE AN ATHEIST, IT'S ILLEGAL TO

BE A JEW, AND IT'S VERY NEARLY

ILLEGAL TO BE A SHIA.

THOUGH ONE OF THE VERY GOOD

THINGS THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

LATELY IS THE SIGNS OF STIRRING

AMONG THE SHIA PEOPLE OF SAUDI

ARABIA, WHO HAPPEN TO DO THE

HEAVY LIFTING IN THE OIL

FIELDS, THEY'RE ALL THE STOOP

WORK DOWN THERE, AND THEY'RE

BEGINNING TO GET IDEAS OUT OF

IRAQ, AND I HOPE WE'RE

ENCOURAGING THEM TO DO SO, AND

MAKE LIFE HELL FOR THE KINGDOM

AND FOR THE WAHABISTS, WHERE

THEY LIVE, EVERY DAY, DO

SOMETHING MEAN TO THEM.

  

Changing the subject, Christopher says

WHAT IS THE REAL RELATIONSHIP

BETWEEN CHINA AND NORTH KOREA,

AND COULD THE CHINESE IMPOSE

CHANGE THERE?

THE ANSWER TO THAT IS,

CERTAINLY THAT THEY COULD -- I

MEAN PART OF THE REASON FOR THE

COLLAPSE OF THE NORTH KOREAN

ECONOMY WAS THE COLLAPSE OF

COMMUNISM IN CHINA AND RUSSIA,

AND THE END OF THE TRADITIONAL

SUBSIDIES THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN

THEM -- THAT PLUS THEIR OWN

FANTASTIC AGRICULTURAL

INCOMPETENCE.

AND THE CHINESE CONTROL MOST OF

THE AVENUES THROUGH WHICH TRADE

GOES IN AND OUT OF NORTH KOREA,

AND THERE IS ALSO ON THE OTHER

SIDE OF THE TU MIN RIVER THAT

SEPARATES THE TWO COUNTRIES,

THERE IS A KOREAN SPEAKING AREA

IN THAT PROVINCE ON THE BORDER,

THERE'S A LARGE, SORT OF KOREAN

SPEAKING MINORITY, ETHNIC

KOREANS, IN FACT, IN CHINA,

WHICH GIVES THEM AN INTEREST.

BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

REFUGEES ARE GOING.

OBVIOUSLY CHINA HOPES THAT

NORTH KOREA DOESN'T COMPLETELY

IMPLODE, BECAUSE IF IT DOES,

THE WHOLE POPULATION WILL TRY

AND ESCAPE INTO CHINA, FACING

THEM WITH A HUGE DEMOGRAPHIC

CRISIS, A MINORITY CRISIS THAT

THEY DON'T NEED.

SO THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN

GETTING A SOFT LANDING FOR THE

REGIME.

AND THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY THEY

SEEM RELUCTANT TO DO ANYTHING

VERY PUBLIC.

BUT THEY HAVE A REAL INTEREST

ON THE DISARMAMENT QUESTION,

WHICH IS THIS.

IF NORTH KOREA CONTINUES ON

WITH THIS PROMISCUOUS POLICY,

IT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY FORCE

THE JAPANESE TO DECLARE

THEMSELVES A NUCLEAR POWER.

THE JAPANESE, WE KNOW, HAVE THE

RESOURCES TO, AND THEY POSSESS

THE KNOWLEDGE TO PUT TOGETHER A

NUCLEAR WEAPON IN A DAY.

THEY JUST DON'T DO IT, BECAUSE

THEIR CONSTITUTION FORBIDS THEM

TO DO IT, AND THERE'S A VERY

LARGE PUBLIC OPINION THAT IS,

FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, VERY ANTI-

NUCLEAR.

BUT IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE

KOREANS LAST TESTED THEIR LONG

RANGE MISSILE, THE MISSILE THAT

THEY'VE BEEN SELLING, BY THE

WAY TO IRAN, AND THAT THEY WERE

GOING TO BE SELLING TO SADDAM

HUSSEIN, HAD HE STAYED IN

POWER.

THEY TESTED IT WITHOUT WARNING,

BY FIRING IT ACROSS JAPAN, SO

IT LANDED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

JAPAN IN THE SEA.

THAT'S HOW THE JAPANESE FOUND

OUT.

THAT DOES MAKE THEM NERVOUS,

BECAUSE THAT MEANS, THEY DON'T

HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION, I

WONDER IF THEY CAN REACH US.

NOW CHINA QUITE OBVIOUSLY DOES

NOT WANT A NUCLEAR JAPAN, SO

YOU CAN DO THE TRIANGULATION OF

IT VERY SIMPLY.

IT'S OBVIOUSLY IN CHINA'S

NATIONAL INTEREST TO KEEP JAPAN

NON-NUCLEAR.

SO FOR THEM TO DO THAT, THEY'LL

HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT NORTH

KOREA BECOMES NON-NUCLEAR, TOO.

SO IT WOULD BE NICE, I THINK,

IF CHINA ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS

WAS THE FACT, AND WE'RE NOT

ASKING THEM TO DO US A FAVOUR,

WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO

THEMSELVES A FAVOUR, AS WELL AS

OF COURSE, THE PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA.

  

Now a clean-shaven man in his twenties says

MY QUESTION, WE WERE

TALKING ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS AND

YOUR STICKS AND YOUR CARROTS,

AND YOU WERE SAYING, YOU'VE GOT

A BOOT TO KICK THEM IF THEY

DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH.

WELL, GOING BACK TO '94, THE

AGREED FRAMEWORK WITH NORTH

KOREA, AND THEY BROKE IT FIVE

MINUTES LATER, AND WE FOUND OUT

IN THE FALL OF 2002 THAT THEY

WEREN'T AGREEING WITH IT.

WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE

REACTION, COME TO THE TABLE

AGAIN, AND WE'LL NEGOTIATE FROM

THIS POINT, OR SOMETHING ELSE,

WITH A STICK.

  

Christopher says WELL

THERE'S A HIDEOUS DIFFICULTY

HERE, WHICH YOU PROBABLY

UNDERSTAND SOME OF, AT LEAST,

WHICH IS THE SAME AS THE ONE I

DWELT ON WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN.

WE DON'T THINK THAT THE MULLAHS

ARE -- I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE

SAID A WORD ABOUT THIS.

I DON'T, AT ANY RATE, THINK THE

MULLAHS ARE MAD IN IRAN, I

THINK THEY ARE QUITE COOL,

QUITE CALCULATING, VERY

CYNICAL, VERY CORRUPT GUYS.

THEY PROFIT ENORMOUSLY FROM THE

PRESENT STATUS QUO, THEY'LL DO

THEIR BEST TO HANG ONTO IT, BUT

THEY'RE NOT--

THEY'RE NOT DERANGED, THEY'RE

NOT DELUSIONAL.

THEIR RELIGION IS PARTLY-- IT

DOES MAKE THEM BELIEVE AND DO

SOME VERY STUPID THINGS THAT

OFTEN ARE AGAINST THEIR SELF-

INTEREST, BUT THAT'S WHAT

RELIGION DOES.

AND IT'S NOT--

IT'S NOT AS TOXIC AS WAHABISM.

WITH NORTH KOREA, THOUGH,

THERE'S EVERY REASON TO THINK

THAT THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF

INSANITY, NOT JUST IN THE

LEADERSHIP, BUT IN THE VERY

SYSTEM ITSELF.

IT'S SET UP TO DRIVE PEOPLE

MAD.

AND THUS, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

TO CALIBRATE A REWARD AND

PUNISHMENT SYSTEM WITH THEM.

AND UM, I'VE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES

OF THE DEMILITARISED ZONE OF

KOREA NOW.

IT'S A HUGE CONCENTRATION OF

VIOLENCE.

AND THE PROBLEM IS, THE CAPITAL

CITY OF SEOUL, THE CAPITAL CITY

OF SOUTH KOREA, IS ABOUT AN

HOUR'S, MAYBE TWO HOUR'S

DRIVE-- IT'S VERY NEAR THE

BORDER.

AND IT'S A HUGE CITY NOW, AND

IT'S ALSO THE CAPITAL OF A

FLOURISHING DEMOCRACY NOW,

AFTER A LONG STRUGGLE.

AND IT COULD BE SATURATED WITH

CONVENTIONAL FIRE FROM NORTH

KOREA, AND EVERY TIME THERE HAS

BEEN WAR GAMES, AND I'VE BEEN

TO SOME OF THESE WAR GAMES IN

THE DMZ, YOU START WITH LOSING

SEOUL, WITHOUT THE NUCLEAR

QUESTION COMING INTO IT.

NOW IF THE NORTH KOREANS DO

THAT, THAT'S THE END OF THEIR

REGIME, NOT JUST THE REGIME,

IT'S THE END OF THE STATE,

NORTH KOREA DOESN'T EXIST AS A COUNTRY.

THAT WOULD BE THE END FOR THEM,

IF THEY DID DO THIS, BUT WE

WOULD HAVE LOST OUR BROTHERS

AND SISTERS IN SEOUL.

NOW IF THE UNITED STATES WAS

THE COUNTRY THAT SOME PEOPLE

THINK IT IS, THEY'D SAY, WELL

WHO CARES?

WE DON'T LIVE THERE, AND KOREA

WOULD NEVER BE A PROBLEM AGAIN.

BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT.

WE CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

OTHERWISE, YOU COULD SEND A

SQUADRON OF PLANES OVER NORTH

KOREA AND YOU COULD DE-

NUCLEARIZE IT IN AN AFTERNOON.

THAT ISN'T A PROBLEM.

AND YOU COULD--

AND THE BEST TIME TO DO THAT,

SOME PEOPLE ARGUE, WOULD BE

RIGHT NOW, BEFORE THE REACTORS

FULLY COME ON STREAM.

BUT WE CAN'T BET--

WE CAN'T BET THAT THEY WOULDN'T

DESTROY THEMSELVES IN AN

ATTEMPT TO DESTROY US IN THE

PROCESS.

AND IT'S MORALLY NOT POSSIBLE

TO TAKE THAT CHANCE.

  

\[Coughing\]

  

He continues AND IF YOU REFUSE TO PAY ANY

MORE TRIBUTE TO THEM, ON THE

EXTORTION SIDE FOR THE MOMENT,

LEAVING THE BLACKMAIL FOR THE

MOMENT, GOING MERELY TO THE

EXTORTION SIDE OF IT, YOU SAY

RIGHT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE

YOU ANY MORE FOOD.

YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO GO

HUNGRY, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

KIM JONG-IL.

AND AGAIN, IT'S MORALLY VERY

DIFFICULT TO SAY, WELL WE HATE

YOU SO MUCH WE'LL STARVE YOUR

POPULATION.

ESPECIALLY WHERE WE NOW HAVE

THE FULL RECORD OF HOW

ABYSMALLY THE UNITED NATIONS

HAVE EXPLOITED AND FLEECED THE

PEOPLE OF IRAQ.

THAT WAS BLOOD FOR OIL, BY THE

WAY, IF YOU WANT A SLOGAN.

  

\[Applause\]

  

Christopher continues TOO KIND, TOO KIND, THANK YOU.
