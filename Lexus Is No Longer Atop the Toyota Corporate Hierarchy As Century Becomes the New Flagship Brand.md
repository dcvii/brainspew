Toyota

- **[Toyota](https://caranddriver.com/toyota) is officially spinning the Century badge into its new flagship brand, according to chairman Akio Toyoda.**
- **The shuffle of brands will move [Lexus](https://caranddriver.com/lexus) from its position as Toyota's premier luxury brand and turn Century into a fully-fledged manufacturer.**
- **According to Simon Humphries, Toyota's chief branding officer, the move will free Lexus up to take on bigger risks.**

Ask a watch nerd about why the hierarchy between Seiko, Grand Seiko, and Credor exists, and they may launch into a long-winded explanation about build quality, dial movement, and legacy. It's not so different from car nerds' relationship to the hierarchy between Toyota, Lexus, and Century, only the Toyota trio just got a little more complicated.

While Lexus has acted as Toyota's luxury brand since its inception in 1989, the Century sedan has been the real chauffeur car of choice for Japanese executives since before Lexus was even formed. Toyota revealed the first Century sedan all the way back at the 1967 Tokyo auto show, with the third, and most recent generation joining the ranks back in 2017. The automaker even expanded the lineup [to include an SUV](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a45022131/toyota-century-suv-revealed/) in 2023. Following that expansion, Toyota is now spinning the Century nameplate into a fully fledged automaker positioned above Lexus in the Toyota corporate ladder.

According to a *[Top Gear](https://www.topgear.com/car-news/business/its-official-step-aside-lexus-century-toyotas-new-top-big-boy-brand)* [report](https://www.topgear.com/car-news/business/its-official-step-aside-lexus-century-toyotas-new-top-big-boy-brand), the decision to transform Century into its own brand came at the behest of Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda. "Until now, Century's place in the company has not been clear," Toyoda said. "Overseas brands are the result of the merger of companies with different roots and origins, but all of these \[Toyota\] brands, except for Daihatsu, have the same roots."

Part of the issue, Toyoda said, was that Lexus was being held to too strict a standard. "Within that, Lexus was like the eldest son and Toyota was like the second son, and I think Lexus had the sense that it had to be responsible as the eldest son," Toyoda said.

"I previously suggested 'why not make an above-Lexus?', but because Toyota is a full-line mass-production manufacturer, they end up taking cars that sell in large quantities. However, when it comes to higher-end cars, even Lexus needs to go above and beyond. Toyota has the Century, so I advised them to position it this way," Toyoda explained.

According to Simon Humphries, Toyota’s chief branding officer, the move will allow Lexus to act more freely, ergo the recent six-wheeled van concept. "In a sense, Lexus will be freer to act. Lexus should continue to take on challenges as a pioneer. Century will take on the high-end market as the top of the top, one of one," Humphries said. Toyota teased a Century coupe earlier this week, which will be revealed later this month at the Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo and should signal the new direction for the Century brand.
