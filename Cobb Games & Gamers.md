### [How to Hide 1Kg of Diamonds](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2020/05/how-to-hide-1kg-of-diamonds.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e20264e2dcffc1200d-pi)So let’s start with giving an evaluation. A parcel of stones at VVG1 to VVG2 at an average size of .35 carats with F-G color will net out to about $3250 per carat. 1kg of such stones will be about 14,285 stones worth about 46.5 million dollars US. So really the question is how would you hide about 15,000 little things worth 45 million bucks. Your ability to hide them depends largely upon one thing, which is your ability to sell them.

If you have no ability to sell any of the stones, then you can only use conventional means, IE something anybody could think up on a middle class salary. In which case you might as well just throw them in the ocean because you’re going to get yourself killed or jailed the moment one person finds out. So there’s a Clean Approach and a Dirty Approach.

Clean Approach  
So the first thing a smart guy will do is to approach someone with moolah and someone you can trust with your life. So for me, I happen to know a couple such people as I am fortunate in that regard. One of them is a Wall Street broker. He would know someone who deals with that level of investment with whom I would partner. I convert a fraction of my diamonds to cash, essentially 2 million worth, and give the other people the impression that this is the extent of my cache. I then set up an entity through which I can employ my own skills and improve them. This would include a cursory understanding of the diamond trade and a couple of trips to such traders and producers. The aim of these trips is to determine how far I can get away with selling diamonds legitimately without being a known quantity in the business. In other words, I’m setting up a diamond laundering business, but I can remain overground and live fairly large.

Dirty Approach  
The other way to go is go underground, which means I live low rather like a card sharp. I produce the occasional rock in card games, to used car dealers, to pawn shops all at a level that people will immediately be able to handle and not talk about. In this case I have to do a lot of low rent stashing and have a 5 year plan to raise about 200k per year.

OK so either approach gets me to the point at which I can use sophisticated means to hide my stash. It costs money to hide money.

The Stashes

One - The Big Pentagram  
I’m thinking undeveloped land in New Zealand would be the best thing for buried treasure. It’s not hard to get there. It’s not a dodgy place. I’d keep the biggest fraction there, roughly half, in five plots underground in a pattern. How about a pentagram 100 meters across? Uncleared woods. GPS tracked. Iron rebar markers with RFID tags. On a hill. (25 million)

Two - Obvious  
I’m going to make a mistake. So it might as well be a stupid mistake. So I’m going to seed the stupid mistake ahead of time so the over-confident detective gets to talk shit. Which means I’m going to put the stash under my mother’s grave, or in a mausoleum niche having bribed a groundskeeper at a cemetery in my town. I will be observed making regular trips. (2 million)

Three - Attorney Client Privilege  
This is the first technically challenging one to place. I troll around to find an attorney like Go Call Saul from Breaking Bad. Living in LA with its drug trade, I’m sure I can find a gang attorney relatively easily. I will put it into this attorney’s hands. I don’t know or don’t care where the attorney puts it, but he only gets his cut as trustee based on his ability to sell the diamonds himself. This is the one I plan to live from. (7 million)

Four - Charity  
I use geocaching to place a handful of random stones into that game. Once a year I travel out of the state and place a rock into a geocache. I drop a rock off into the coffers of various churches in my travels. (<1 million)

Five - Rich Bitches  
I develop a rapport with douchebags of all sorts who can fence this kind of stuff on their own. I develop a reputation and then flame out quickly. It will cost me getting my ass kicked but among that crowd I will clearly appear broke and flamed out. Kills suspicion. (1 million)

Six - Other Hidey Holes  
Smaller versions of the pentagram. All self-service all visited during peak tourist season.

1. Black River National Forest: Michigan
2. Mount Washington: New Hampshire
3. Hot Springs: Arkansas
4. Sturgis: South Dakota
5. Gifford Woods State Park: Vermont

And I periodically check Quora, detective novels and CIA spycraft legends just to make sure I’m up on the best ideas. After all, I’ve got nothing else to do.

### [1982](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2018/07/1982.html)

_'1982' is a barcade in DTLA.[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e2022ad37d7898200d-pi)_

I just assume that it's all about 1982, so I put on a white shirt, skinny black tie and my clubmans Falling Down style and headed to the bar EightyTwo in DTLA.

I got the high score on PacMan and three replays on Centaur. I had an Oban. I puffed a little vapor and I sorta dug the music which was and was not retro, but it was certainly loud. I met my brothers and Pops and for the time we weren't somewhat peeved that nobody in the joint cared a whit about putting the UConn game on, we had a ball at EightyTwo, the new 'barcade'.

What's strange at this moment is that although I feel like I could talk for hours about pinball and arcade videogames, I really don't feel like it. I mean basically the chick who owns the pinball machines kinda put me right in my place. I know I'm never going to step up and buy a pinball machine, even my favorite of all time, Bow & Arrow. And I know I'm never going to know more than 80% of what's worth knowing about what I kinda know. Like I eyeballed a machine that was built circa 1977 and I nailed that, but as she said, I was mostly right but wrong on the details. When I was 20 years old, I could have written a disertation of electromechanical pinball and arcade video games. I'm sure that I have spent something on the order of $2500 a year in quarters when I was in my Virtua Fighter championship form. But..

I'm out of joint and feeling somewhat weird about my relationships to the machines now that it has come around to this upscale hip joint that looks like it could have fallen off the back porch of the Standard Hotel. I popped at a million points on Centaur and turned to say, "At least machines have paid me more than I've paid them", which is true. Computers have been very very good to me. But I had several of those unbelievably low scoring balls and my typical movement of disgust was all there in muscle memory - never striking the glass, spinning around in place with my arms flailing in agony, but not wide enough to strike the next pinballer over, and never tilting in anger. It was the familiar frustration made unfamiliar by the whiskey. I never used to drink and game.

I'm all ready to drink and game if I can find the right friend to come with me. But I never have. I've always been, with very few exceptions, the lone gamer, the pickup gamer. It was never me and my crew, it was always me meeting the regulars at the arcade. Young men like myself known only by first name, if that, and their reputations as foosballers, or fighters. Whether it was Holiday Bowl on Crenshaw or Mr. Motos right across the street, or Sega Center at the Fox Hills Mall. Maybe it was Shatto Bowl or the legendary on Woody's on Figueroa. Midtown Bowl had a pretty good lineup but there was a great arcade across the street from LACC. Down on Broadway, I dropped a lot of quads, especially on Defender, yike.

My love affair with the arcades of the city is bittersweet of course. The social rules and rewards of arcade fighting games like Mortal Combat was a later phenomenon. I already was bathed in the solitude of pinball and of the digital cabinet games. It matters to get a high score on PacMan and there is that retro cinematic moment when you could stand back and have a few admirers, but as sad and lonely as it seemed in the movie Tron it was more desolate in life. We are the Tron generation and it is not entirely a happy thing to see the popularity of our old obsessions brought to life. It's a little bit shameful, at least for someone my age. There's no such baggage for the XBox generation, and I hope they enjoy and discover what joy we knew from those moments of finding treasure in Gauntlet, dodging sprites in Robotron or jumping that bridge correctly in Dragon's Lair. The social experience of an arcade has changed with the advent of Dave & Busters and now these new upscale hip joints. It's a lot less depressing than it used to be when arcades were on the outskirts of society.

### [Destiny Two: First Speculation, Halo ODST Revisited](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2017/03/destiny-two-first-speculation-halo-odst-revisited.html)

So here's what I know about Destiny 2. The City is destroyed. The Tower is destroyed. Guardians are outcast to the wilderness and flying around the system to find enough weapons and stuff to save Earth. But the really interesting idea I heard was that there will be something like co-op missions where you find a member of the Vanguard and fight along side them. That gets a wow. Now I'm also speculating that there will be rescue missions. It doesn't take much poking around this reveal trailer to see that there is a guardian shepherding civilians along to safety. That's fabulous. And I'll also throw it out there that there may be some flying involved and attacking Cabal ships from your own ship. That would be super magnificent. But what Destiny needs more than anything is a competent way to tell stories. The only thing they've done very well in that entire area of creativity centers around the wit and attitude of Cayde-6 and the interchanges between him and the other Vanguard members in the Taken King. 

So if there is a surefire way to continue this style along with the idea of rescuing civilians in general and Vanguard members in particular (as well as the rest of the denizens of the Tower) then Bungie already has a model: [Halo ODST](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2009/09/odst-first-look.html).

> The first thing you notice about ODST is that it's quiet. It's night. You're lost. You're sneaking around trying to find your way around New Mombasa and there are patrols of Covies around every corner. But you've got silenced weapons, enhanced vision and your Halo skills. Fair fight. The music is thematically very different. It's occasionally noir, jazzy, solemn. It feels like the music of the dark and lonely night. For moments, ODST approaches Splinter Cell. In fact, that's the first way to think about it as an FPS, because you are not the Master Chief, the monk's chant is not in the background, you are on Earth and there are no Elites to be found alive. What the heck is going on here? You are on the front lines.The hardest thing, and the greatest thing you have to get used to in ODST is that you start to realize how deadly the Covenant are. Sure, when Brutes were introduced in 3, it took a minute to figure them out, but after a while you mowed them down. You were the Chief. Now you're not and it takes two, maybe three melees to take out a grunt. And if you think you can just melee a brute because his helmet is off, think again. Your combat style has to change. Heroics will get you killed. You are not a Spartan. This is _**not**_ Sparta!

Wow that was eight years ago.  But now I invite you to think about the arc of the story of ODST. You start off with basically the weakest of weapons, almost like [Splinter Cell: Double Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell:_Double_Agent), where you begin in jail with none of your fancy weapons. You're lost in a city and you have to combine up with the members of your team. You don't get to use rocket launchers until you find the teammate who used rockets. You look for clues as to where this missing teammate might be and search your way through foreign territory.

Now imagine that in Destiny. Just as you started the original campaign with one weapon, you'll have to gain rank before you can even get your super. And then it was a while before you could be strong enough to compete in the Crucible. So all that is possible again. Your guardian is completely rebooted, stripped of all goodies. The Tower is gone. You have no ship. It would be a while before you can get off the planet and up to the Reef. Man that sounds interesting.

### [No Man Loves AI](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2016/09/no-man-loves-ai.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201b8d222572c970c-pi)The wildly anticipated videogame **No Man's Sky** is a failure. It's greatest feature is its greatest failure. It promises that its universe is procedurally generated. That means the developers didn't actually draw all of the heads on all of the creatures, on all of the planets, rather it gave the computer a set of rules and let the microchips do all the thinking. Not just the creatures, but the planets themselves, the plants on them, the structures, down the color of the grass and mushrooms. A few months after its release, nobody is playing. In fact, it's so bad that [people are suing](https://www.gamnesia.com/news/no-mans-sky-is-being-investigated-by-the-uks-advertising-standards-authorit).

This is a bullet point I will get back to.

### [A Serious Gamer's Thanks to Bungie for The Taken King](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2015/09/a-serious-gamers-thanks-to-bungie-for-the-taken-king.html)

I am one of those players who gets it. I have wanted what Destiny primarily is for years and years. A co-op multiplayer FPS with the highest quality graphics and mechanics where I and my friends get to be the hero. Almost every day for a year I have been telling my wife that I'm done with work, now I'm going to go shoot some bad guys. Destiny is deeply satisfying in that way. I used to play Halo & Assassin's Creed. I still play Splinter Cell and I'm looking forward to The Division. But in terms of weapons and capabilities, no avatar in existence compares to my guardians. And now with a third subclass, it gets even better. Everything else feels slow, constricted, flat and retro. I wanted you to know that I put in 1700 hours last year because nothing else compares. Destiny gets 90% of my gaming attention. I've reduced my Gamefly from three to one rental.

I also want you to know that I have quit this forum early on. I understand and respect your patience with your customers. You have to deal with it. I don't. As a software developer, I sympathize with you and I have enormous respect for your ability to execute on the core and deliver all kinds of features and fluff as well. But listening to the whinging about fluff is more than I can stand. Today I see thousands of posts about exploits. If Bungie were a business plan, this room would be full of the managers chirping with glee about how to cheat the customer out of unlimited money. I made an ass of myself here over a year ago explaining how ridiculous it would be for Destiny to have Forge or Split Screen. The hating never stopped. Thanks for backing me up on that (heh). But hey, I game with my friends, and I smack the rest down in the Crucible, even when they use the Last Word I get mine in. (A new weapon should be called Edgewise) So in that way I am happy to have millions of gamers to play with even if I couldn't stand them in person. You're keeping the critical mass high and Destiny has never gone dark (although it has gone beaver and marionberry). Keep it up.

The pivot of The Taken King is testament to how well you are running the company in terms of pure, balls out execution. Nobody can really know all of the decisions you all must take, but I know the tradeoffs must be mind-melting. But you stuck the landing here fellows. No matter what the press says (Forbes, really?) and how often they keep the whining alive, you have stuck to the core and delivered. I am exceedingly pleased with the new Crucible maps I'm getting, the new character dynamics within the Vanguard, the cutscenes and even the music, as monothematic as it is this go round. Special kudos for the questification.

I wanted to make a special note as an FPS guy who also has played a lot of RPG but not MMO. Your decision not to clutter up my screen with text and use voiceover that doesn't interrupt my avatar movement is a strength I really appreciate. I didn't know how much until I took a break and played Elder Scrolls Online this summer. I'm even wondering if I will be able to appreciate Fallout 4. I like being boss man in the Destiny world, and not stopping to talk to NPCs who want me to find their lost uncle. Although it would be super cool if within a raid, the game picked the weakest player and made the other five do an escort mission. Just saying. It's what made the randomization change to Atheon superb. My point is that the risk taken to recast the ghost, I'm sure you've heard before, was gutsy and as I read the availability story, necessary. Good for the scanning adds too in TTK. I really, really like the interactive voice work of the Vanguard during my story missions. And by the way, I don't think people who get into the North vs Dinklage debate appreciate how little that matters to the rest of the world you serve in languages other than English. So long as it's not text. I recall back during the beta, how annoyed I was getting stomped on that moon map and Lord Shaxx yelling at me. You won me over. I love more Shaxx in TTK. Thanks for that.

I have nothing much to say in the gun balance meta wars. But something occurred to me yesterday as I was contemplating your need to keep level 1 enemies in the Cosmodrome where there will be level 40 guardians (and beyond in the future). There must be some interesting curves in the game somewhere as you escalate the guardian powers or provide the illusion of ever increasing power for weapons and armor. At the release of TTK, 170 was the new 365, but surely these must be relative scales and not absolute ones. Anyway, you know what I'm talking about, having changed the sponginess of Valus Ta'aurc. That, to me, is a much more interesting problem for the entire game rather than which particular gun does what. As far as I can see, you've finessed it. But I'm wondering exactly how.

I am impressed with how you have tweaked your economies and currencies several times and various ways. I would really be fascinated to see some of the metrics on that stuff and understand the theory of that particular kind of economy in which players cannot exchange or set their own prices. It works, and please don't change it. But the theory must be fascinating.

All this is to say that there are some of us out here who appreciate the hard thinking that must of necessity go into the design and maintenance of this extraordinarily complex creation that you have made. I happen to think that for some fraction of the post-industrial world will depend upon what you have learned in making Destiny work. You might be as theoretically advanced as the architects of the Matrix, but I'm sure you don't let that overwhelm your egos, because you clearly do not toy with or abuse us. I intuit your purposes and principles and I am, as I said, deeply satisfied by the core and impressed with your delivery and execution. You have my investment of time and my admiration. Starside is a pretty good place becauas ultimately, my guardians are badass.

### [The Difference Between Horseshit and Bullshit](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2015/07/the-difference-between-horseshit-and-bullshit.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201b8d1417d56970c-pi)I am particularly fond of the term bodewash, for what it's worth. Yet I think that there are appropriate axes of shit that should be navigated with some care. 

The other night, as my clan-mates and I were engaged in the [Iron Banner](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iron+banner&t=ffab&ia=web), a certain combination of unfortunate and somewhat unanticipated circumstances prompted one of them to roar, "You've got to be fucking kidding me!" And then on another occasion, "You've got to be fucking shitting me!"  I pause a moment to think about those outbursts as they indicate someone rationally making moves when suddenly gravity is reversed. 

Horseshit is a term which I think applies to a specific instance of falsity. And in that regard it would be less of an insult to 'call horseshit' on a particular matter. If I am saying that some situation is full of shit, it is generally horseshit to which I am referring. Likewise, I think my gaming friend had a moment of outrage, and the surprise of "You've got to be shitting me" must be inferred to indicate horseshit. 

If the same thing happened over and over, I'm sure he would have thrown down the controller and walked out of the room exclaiming "This is bullshit!" Bullshit thus in contrast requires that one recognize and implicate a continuous and purposeful production of shit. An average cow is double the weight of an average mare and the average cattle herd is generally much larger than the average herd of horses, although I cannot say my experience with these observations is expert. Nevertheless, it's useful to consider these facts with the understanding that the bulls will produce more shit. 

It is also useful to note that horses are much taller than cattle, run faster and range further. Thus their noses are not as likely to detect their own shit, whereas bullshit is generally found fairly closely to the bull.

### [The Taken King 'Revolt'](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2015/06/the-taken-king-revolt.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201b8d130ac93970c-pi)Bungie wields a dual-edged sword by sponsoring its community of crackhead gamers for the crack that is Destiny. Recently, one of the designers of the newest announce release 'The Taken King' has said that they have created player emotes that are so cool that people 'would throw money at the screen' to have them. The big controversy is that with what is essentially 'Destiny 2', the people at Bungie have got the nerve to make an all new Collector's Edition for 80 bucks which includes all the content from 'Destiny 1'. 

Since I game with many Destiny primadonnas I heard grief about this last week. It reminded me of a couple things.

First of all, prior to this, I think the biggest controversy by the dainty whiners in the Bungie forums, (who go out of their way to describe how they're actually still in love with Bungie (like co-dependent lovers)) was the idea that Bungie had included 'Dark Below' maps in the original game. IE, Bungie is trying to ripoff their players by forcing them to pay for content they had already downloaded. Evidently some players had managed to obsessively [glitch their way into areas of the game that had yet to be populated or completed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBwJaIgV7ac). So the speculation was that 'huge' areas of content were already in place and that Bungie was cheesing development so they could just 'flip a switch' and charge more money for work that had already been completed. 

I stopped going to Bungie's forums after this kind of crappy complaint became common. So it is actually possible that people still complain about that while I pay it no mind. As far as I knew,  the release of the Dark Below showed that only one room was used in that next release. Obviously I didn't even pay attention to the glitchers. If you have the patience to watch 10 minutes of that video, then maybe you fall into my category of dainty. Bungie explained of course that as important as art direction is, the skyboxes and levels/rooms are the simplest pieces to add. The difficult work is in spawning the enemies and making everything a game instead of just an empty room you walk through. 

The second thing I note on this matter is something I've understood for a while in my studies of Taleb. That is the matter of affording to make mistakes. When we hate on rich people, it's generally because they are powerful and stupid. How can one be powerful and stupid at the same time? Simple. When you are rich, you can afford to make mistakes. Related to this matter is whether or not money buys happiness. Well, if you make a lot of mistakes and you don't have money, you'll be more upset at your losses. Think of the expression "There's an hour that I'll never get back." 

So consequently, the people who are likely to complain most bitterly over the features of Destiny 2, or anything for that matter, are those whose bang for buck satisfaction level requirement is very high. Which is an interestingly different take on the term 'high maintenance' which we generally ascribe to more affluent people. 

I've spent well over 1000 hours in Destiny since September and I'm perfectly satisfied that the 80 bucks or whatever I paid for it is money well spent. In fact, I think about that almost all the time when I have free time. Downloading a two hour movie for 10 bucks is a complete waste of money to me, whereas I would easily spend $100 a year to play Destiny. 

--

I should add that as a gamer, my style is that of a completionist, and I also appreciate that which I appreciate. In other words, I am very happy taking my time to complete every aspect of a game. I'm never in a hurry to be first. Many of the Destiny gripers want more, more more, and then blast through the content to maximize their player levels, then complain that there is nothing new to do. Yes it's a grind to maximize as soon as possible and then boring to do everything else once you've reached the highest level. That's something of a jaded personality trait, if you ask me. Like the man who does everything possible to get the Wall Street job and half million dollar compensation package before the age of 30 and then calls the rest of the nation 'flyover country'.

One rather hopes that high stakes players remain at the high stakes tables, or that they can actually be commensurately happy playing penny ante games with the common man.

### [Glitching and Learning](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2015/01/glitching-and-learning.html)

My theory of information dynamics says that knowledge cannot be maintained without the expense of energy. I'm finding an interesting inefficiency in my gaming lately. The presence of exploits both expands expertise and decreases propriety.

It is inevitable that as much as I game, that I will be using analogies to that in life. Get over it. Because Lombardi. But just in case you need an intro, here's a thick paragraph about the Destiny Raid:

**Destiny Raid**  
Destiny is a free-roam open sandbox videogame in which the player takes on the avatar of a Guardian. A soldier who runs individual and small cooperative missions against legions of extraterrestrial baddies. The area of operations is the inner planets of the Solar System, Earth, Venus, Mars, Earth's moon, and Mercury. This sort of gameplay (PvE) falls into three categories, Patrol, Strike and Raid. Patrols are random in that there are not specific targets for your activity, although one can select various mercenary missions while on patrol. You can go solo or with up two two buddies as your loot and shoot. Strikes are more crafted adventures with a brief bit of story to get you going - rather like the messages at the beginning of Mission Impossible, you are assigned to take down this and such boss, facing several preliminary battles along the way. The Raids, however are the showpiece and crown jewel of Destiny. On a Raid, you need six players to accomplish tasks that are impossible to guess. Magical things happen that are not obvious, the rules of physics are bent and the team must figure out a way to overcome them. More than just sequences of enemy attacks, but changes in the physical enviroment take place on the way to beat the final boss. There are no instructions for these battles. Teams have to figure out what works. 

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201b7c73e89a4970b-pi)

Now I'm going to talk about one particular Raid level and the exploit we have been using. It is the second level of the Crota Raid. Interestingly enough, I don't know what it's called. But here's how we play it, and playing it this way made me think about glitching and learning. In case you're not familiar with the term, 'glitching' means taking advantage of a weakness in a systems and short-cutting the process in a way contrary to the way the designers had in mind. For example, if you're hiking down a series of switchbacks, you might literally cut the corners by going down the middle of the hill instead of the gradual left an right on the beaten path. 

As our team enters the second level, we are stand at the top of a set of stairs over looking a pair of plazas. Between the plazas is a cliff. Each plaza is about 200 meters east and west and 75 meters north and south. The gap between the two is about 150 meters. On each plaza are three 10 meter radius circles forming a shallow triangle that points to the other plaza. The top of each triangle is the circle that lies at the foot of an invisible bridge between the two plazas. In the feet of each triangle are tall structures that hover above the center of their respective circle. These, are called 'totems'. So there are four totems, two on each side. The play begins once a player descends the staircase and enters the plaza.

**Method One**  
Behind the near plaza is a large room cut into the face of the mountain. Our method is to hide five players in this room at its extreme rear while one player goes out and excites the enemies. How exactly he does so is a mystery, I've never seen what he does. I'm one of the hidden players. After about 30 seconds, two things happen. First an enemy called a Swordbearer comes out of the hidey room from a small door on the right, below the platforms upon which we are hidden. Then, all of the enemies that have generated out on the plaza dissappear leaving just the Swordbearer. We all then go out to the plaza and attack the Swordbearer who drops the sword. One player is designated to stand at the bridge circle, this materializes the invisible bridge between the two plazas. Two other players are designated to stand in the totem circles. Once gameplay begins, if no players occupy those circles the totems will begin to glow red, and after about 20 seconds destroy the entire team. The trick then is to create the bridge, destroy the Swordbearer, and keep the totems quiet. Then one player can take the sword across the bridge and face another enemy, the Gatekeeper. 

The most difficult part of this part of the game is that usually there are multiple enemies swarming the plaza harassing the players in the totem circles. The difficulty is defeated by the team using the rear platform of the hiding room which, for the purposes of generating enemies, makes the presence of the five hiding players invisible. Destiny levels up difficulty by taking into account the number and strength of the players. Few players, few enemies. More players, more enemies. By hiding, we eliminate the possibility of the game generating more enemies.

**Method Two**  
In this version, all of us go out onto the plaza. One player must be the sort who can regenerate his life after death. We go and thin the enemies a bit. When the Swordbearer comes out we degrade him a small bit, but then all of the players jump off the cliff in close proximity to each other, including the regenerating player. The game begins a countdown clock to resetting the level and just as it hits 1 second, the last player regenerates his life and then restores the lives of the other players. The effect is that the multiple harassing enemies do not regenerate and only the Swordbearer is left. He can then be dispatched in short order and the sword taken across the bridge. 

Both of these methods are effective in eliminating the primary difficulty of defending the totem circles from swarming enemies while trying to kill the Swordbearer, who is more than any single player can defeat in a short period of time. Doing this will creating the bridge adds to the chaos, which is reduced through these glitchy methods.

However the result is that I personally, and certainly many other gamers who have passed through this level have done so without having experienced the game the way on presumes the designers intended. However this is different than a cheat because we were given an environment whose rules were discovered by experimentation, not explicitly laid out by its creators. The aim of the game is to survive and advance. Whatever works, works. Or as the meme says 'Everything bows to success, even grammar'. 

**We avoided the difficulty of the challenge of harassment incurred defending the totems, by convincing the game that we didn't exist.**

Harassment incurred defending the totems is a particularly apt way to describe a lot of life's challenges present in society every day. It has the virtue of allowing one not particularly skilled at defending totems to survive and advance. One might possibly, through all of the shortcuts, manages to beat Crota, the goal of the Raid. That's a win. The game only polices itself, but there's a meta game as well. How you beat Crota matters in some circles. Ultimately, the most skilled players will figure out how to defend the totems and win, or not waste their time doing so and still win. After all, only multiple wins in the Raid can gain you all the gear randomly distributed at the end of the final boss battle.  

I'm not so much interested in the ethical question here, because that's ultimately longitudinal in the meta game. Either the game creators will fix the exploit - say by resizing the hiding room, or find some way to raise the difficulty in another aspect of the mechanics of the Raid. The designers do indeed update the game to block usage of those exploits they deem to be 'cheese', while leaving others intact. That feedback loop is thus is self-correcting and the game becomes ultimately what the designers intend it to be. Their decision for popularity of a game level, or difficulty is the balance they must strike. But what about the knowledge?

I said at the outset that the presence of exploits increases expertise and decreases propriety. If I beat the plaza level, then I am an expert, whether or not I take the architected path. I will continue to play the way I do and teach others to play the way I do. They in turn will play according to the method they learned. There's an interesting dynamic at work in such cooperative endeavors obviously involving leadership and expertise but also consensus. Everybody on the team doesn't necessarily want to learn so much as win. So it's not so very likely that someone playing with the same circle of friends that team up to raid will learn multiple methods. Only going outside your small circle will you come to better understand the mysteries, and how many of them will be actually doing it 'the hard way' as the designers intended?

The proper way to beat the game involves defending the totems. (Sorry if I can't get over the aptness of the metaphor). And yet when certain methods are employed, that task - which was added for the purpose of making things more challenging (and fun?) - disappears as do the consequent difficulties. The skill of defending totems is lost, and over time their very meaning can be lost. As more experts figure out more alternatives to gaming the game, the rationality of the game design itself can come into question. This happens all the time in Destiny, as in life.

There is a meta game to which we take on various levels of care. The method by which you approach the game is a signal of your skill in the game, which others will interpret as you temporarily collaborate. But glitching itself is a skill which is not only valuable to the player who aims to survive and advance, but to the designer who has an opportunity to eliminate, modify or let the exploit remain. Sometimes you want to play with glitchers, sometimes you don't.

### [The Aha Moment of Destiny](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2014/09/the-aha-moment-of-destiny-.html)

Last night I had an experience with Destiny that has changed the way I look at the game. I think I understand what's going on here. It is an experience that changes it from just another shooter into something far more.  

What I did was die. I died every minute. And unlike the other times when I had died in Destiny I did not automatically respawn after three seconds. Nor did I automatically respawn after thirty seconds. I died and stayed dead, with enemies pounding my dead corpse with energy weapons and swords, until my teammate could revive me. Half the time, when I was revived by my teammate, she died immediately after and so I had to double back and revive her. Your instinct is to run away. You cannot. 

We were participating in the Weekly Heroic Strike at level 26. Two of us were already 26s, I had just barely become a 25. We were two hunters and a warlock, a sunsinger, a bladedancer and myself a gunslinger. We battled the Phogoth in the Summoning Pits. We beat Phogoth before, all of us had battled all of these enemies before, and as the narrator said, we sent their souls screaming back to hell. But during this particular battle, things were different. Immediately we recognized that even the level 6 flunkies at the beginning of the strike were stubbornly difficult to kill. We ignored them and kept plowing through the Hellmouth, but just after we bounded down the stair where the meathooks hang from the ceiling, things got ugly. 

We started to die. This was way too early and these enemies had been familiar to us, why are they able to kill us? Our tactics were not working. The weapons we usually used to dominate seemed puny now. The combination of armor we were wearing, didn't seem to protect us as well. The super power we used to blast through foes now simply didn't. I used my golden gun on a level 26 wizard and the thing didn't go down in two shots. Usually it just takes one. Two, and it was still up! What fresh hell is this? Our go-to powers were gone. 

They say that only a fool keeps doing the same thing and expecting different results. We were being fools, for a long time. We kept saying. "This sucks'", "This is hard", but we kept trying. We got through the second room finally after about 20 minutes. Fortunately, or unfortunately as the case may be, we didn't have to restart the whole room. You see what goes on in Destiny at this level is that while your team of three may have infinite respawns individually, if the three of you are killed, the room restarts. You have to begin that part of the adventure all over again. It doesn't matter how close you come to unlocking the next door or how long you have been trying. If you all die, Destiny exacts its toll without remorse. Start over. You're doing it wrong. After a while, 15 minutes or so into this second room and dying many different ways we started realizing a couple things. The first, is that these wizards will 'puppy dog' your dead body. If you are killed by a wizard, it's going to stay there and make it that much harder for you to be revived. The most important thing I realized was that my teammate has Radiance. When she's fully powered up, she can raise herself from the dead.

They say that the noose focuses the mind. In Destiny's Heroic Strikes, you get a lot of focusing. But most of the time, you want to focus on blaming the game for just upping the level of you enemies, and making it so damned difficult. It's not a simple matter of 'if you do this, then that will happen'. There's chance - there are slim chances. The strike will challenge you beyond your ability to remember. It's only after having failed continuously for an hour, at midnight, when you want to quit, quit, quit, but you don't. THEN you start trying something different. Well, what if I use this gun instead? What if I go gunslinger instead of bladedancer. Well that means I'll be able to triple jump onto those platforms. Maybe if we take out the yellow-bar enemies then the ordinary red bar enemies won't come out. What if we concentrate fire on those guys first? What if we try to all hit the Phogoth at once. What if we switch off, two of us against the rats, and one against the boss? What if we all hide? Will that stop enemies from respawning? What did we do to get the Phogoth off the chain so soon? How do we handle all three of those wizards up on that platform? What is the safest part of this area? Should we stay together or split up? What if we get rid of all the rat enemies and then concentrate on the boss? 

It took us about two hours. We had to retry the room at about a dozen times. We lost count. But we kept charging in. We kept saying, damn this is hard. We're never going to forget this. Each of us wanted to quit. But then one of us would run through the door and then start the whole thing over, and the rest of us would follow. We persisted. We changed strategies and tactics. We tried everything. Finally we figured it out. 

Destiny is a no-excuses game of hardball. Nothing you do in it makes sense until you and your team are tested at the level of a heroic strike. Yeah you can get cool gear, you can farm loot, but no matter what you do, you haven't played Destiny at its deeper level until you have faced your own anger and frustration at not being able to kill all the baddies that you used to kill. As they kill you and your team, you have to figure out their behaviors because when everything they do doesn't kill you, you don't pay attention. When suddenly it takes three of you to figure them out, then you must pay attention. Or you quit.

You may not like what I'm going to say next. There's a lot of quitters out there. There's a lot of quitter in all of us, as gamers and as people. I have to say that Destiny actually tests you character. If you want to win at this game, you have to make sense of deadly chaos and face it. What is Destiny's tagline? Be Brave. Yeah. You have to, because the game will kill you. The only way to win at this game is to forget what you think you know, and make something work. And there are millions of choices in Destiny and you are going to die for the consequences of your choices, over and over again, until you rethink and retry. The right combination is persistence, flexibility, humility and courage. And trust your teammate with your life. That a video game brings this out is no accident. The battle mechanics of Destiny are damn near perfect. There are no excuses for you to say you pushed a button and nothing happened. The game executes your will, and the game can be won, but it's hard. That's what makes it great.

So Destiny is a test of your will. I think you can only discover that one way, which is to succeed against the odds. Then and only then will you understand what this game is all about. Until you have pushed yourself to you limit and then beyond, you're just playing around and being cute in your little Guardian suit. There's plenty of that kind of fun in Destiny, and I'll be doing it merrily. But then I'll have to steel myself for some PvP in the Crucible and then warm up for a Strike like this one. One day soon, I'll be ready for the Raid. lt's a frightening prospect. There's something deep going on here, and I know I'm not the only one that feels it.

### [From Old Russia With Love](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2014/07/from-old-russia-with-love.html)

**[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201a511e9c131970c-pi)Hands On Beta Finally**  
I have been watching everything related to Destiny for over a year now, and I am almost overwhelmed with excitement about what is turning out to be one of the most important game events of the decade. I got my hands on the game and ladies and gentlemen, it is massive. 

I'm going to say it simply. Destiny is literature. It is so rich in style, function and in metaphor that it simply cannot be evaluated all at once. You have to experience its many dimensions hands on. After about 27 hours of play, I can tell you that it is immensely rewarding and still holds many promising vistas. Here are my impressions.

**Next Gen Color & Light**  
The first thing that struck me as I began playing Destiny was how incredibly rich, textured and beautiful the colors were. This is a next generation game with certainty. There is nothing on your computer you have seen in any of the videos that prepare you for the impact of the color and shadow and lighting effects. Some of it is emotionally realistic and some of it is fantastic. The twilight blue of the entire Old Russia feels like day an night at the same time. The light snow on the sunny day feels a bit surrealistic, and there's nothing that gives you a sense of wind, even on the tops of the mountainous Skywatch. But the murky dark of the abandoned Cosmodrome is, hands down, the most haunting use of blackness in a videogame I've ever encountered. The darkness feels weighty, it is not the absence of light, it has depth. The way your flashlight only goes so far but you can catch the faint wisps of enemies many meters in front of you is brilliantly executed. Destiny's Old Russia is the essence of rust and Cold Warish technology crusted over with dust, and mangy overgrowth. And yet it captures the majesty of Something That Was, just like the line of derelict cars suggested so many months ago.   

Many months ago, the principals at Bungie said that they were serious about creating different color palettes expressing their feelings about each planet. It more than works. It creates a new kind of immersion. 

**Enemies: Diversity is Good  
**The enemies are wonderous and they make me forget all about the Covenant. I watched some old videos of Halo2, and of course that's not a fair comparison, but I enjoyed remembering how cool it was to have the Brutes, a new enemy in the series. And I recall how different AIs in 343's Halo 4 might make for a different style of Halo play. Now I am just getting the hang of evading the twirling blue fire of the Fallen's Dregs and internalizing their crafty motions, along with plodding Captains and their flamethrowers, but then come the relentless Shanks, and then the spooky eyeball Servitors. Good one on that Bungie, you kept Servitors completely secret. But what a wondrously creepy idea, this giant black and purple floating mechanical eyeball that suddenly hyperjumps right behind you. Whoosh. And that's just one species of baddy. Then you have the Hive whose Thralls just bumrush you like fast, hungry, slashing zombies. 

Let me break off to say this about the Beta's enemies. Bungie was very smart to leave most of the spaces with low level fodder. The one thing that's mad different about Destiny is the huge range of destructive power that your players and NPCs can weild. I found that as overused as the term 'balanced' is, it is clear that there is some artful finessing going on, because there is a world of hurt that would await any Guardian dealing with enemies two or three levels up, as well as delicious badass satisfaction in wiping away a horde of them who are two levels weaker. 

Battles between the Hive and the Fallen are serious. I've seen them get into it on Skywatch and thinking that there is something more going on than what I thought. I was almost afraid to step in and NovaBomb them. Almost. 

**Moon: Beauty, Horror & Mayhem  
**I felt a little bit guilty stealing through the Moon this afternoon. I wrote the following on Facebook:

> The moon is awesome. It is gorgeously creepy with a combination of Geiger, Riddick Necromonger, Egyptian Tomb environments. The music, the faint trembling in your controller, the wisps of darkness. It's almost a shame to walk through it alive. I have been to the Circle of Bones in the Hellmouth. I have destroyed a Hallowed Ogre in the World's Grave. My hands are still trembling. l just put down the controller to have a breath, because the Moon is frightening.

The guilt came from the fact that I definitely wandered into some large areas that were severely underpopulated by baddies. The environment alone was spine-tingly intimidating and still inspiringly crafted. I could read in the art direction a purposeful blend of environmental effects, music, controller buzz, creatures and light that evoked a profound Gothic horror experience. And yet even though I could sense the threat, there were never quite enough bad guys in there to smash my bones into the pre-existing piles. I cheated my way into the deep underground chambers of the Hellmouth and got away with it. There were areas that made me feel forebodings I haven't had since the first time I watched the scarred humans Benearth the Planet of the Apes who worshipped The Bomb. 

When I took a break and watched [Datto blasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_MHrGaLDtM) his way at breakneck speed just looking for something to shoot on Twitch, the whole scene seemed to profane the environment. It felt like, here these artists at Destiny have spent years crafting this awesome environment and then a bunch of boy gamers come in and start tossing grenades and wisecracking about exactly where the invisible ceiling is as their Titans double jump across a cathedral. Yes I know that's the point of a shooter, but you can see that Destiny is much more - yet also done for and dedicated to shooters. 

**Crucible: Appropriately Named**  
I particpated in the Iron Banner and made Rank One, but was intimidated the whole way through, getting my ass handed to me on a regular basis by gamers whose Guardians had high defense scores (I saw one with 157) and low Grimoire scores, (averaging around 350). So I'm the kind of PvP player who loves to brag about KD ratios when mine is high, and skulk around muttering when mine is low. I was so devastated in my first half dozen forays into the Crucible that I started taking the announcer's comments personally. Yeah I know I can do better than 0.23 KD but I didn't this time, OK?  I was getting huffy and defensive. But I decided to slog it out. Even though I was almost always first out with a good score, I would start getting owned and it took me a while to score above 2000 consistently. 

Then I began to notice that there was really no shortcut. Everybody has to spend the hours and only because this is a Beta am I completely freaked out. I have a job and responsibilities, and I can't get in the 40 hours necessary within one week of gaming to excel. It still took two dozen trips to the Crucible for me to start reprogramming my Halo, Titanfall and Battlefield reflexes to make this my primary shooter. And since I spent so much time buffing out all three of my characters, it took a while for me to figure out that I really want to play CQ with my Warlock -- which is weird because that's exactly what I didn't want to do as I was watching all of the PSN folks play in the days before the XBox gamers were allowed into the Beta. I wanted to try my hand at stealth and sniping with the hunter. But it turns out that the verticality of the double jump controllable glide of the Warlock is a much better tactic, besides I sucked at knowing lines of fire in the maps with my Hunter and got owned that way too. Nothing worse than a sniper fight you always lose. Well, lining up a shot and getting clobbered from behind. All of this is a jumpstart and I have had nowhere near enough time to refine my tactics and strategies as I have for Battlefield and Titanfall, much less Halo. Call me back on Halloween, I'm going to come aces.

There will always be better players than I - those for whom Destiny PvP is no mere game, who would rather quit a match than suffer a dent in their KD. Whatever to them, but I do actually kind of like the relentless hardcore attitude of the Crucible along with its attendant rewards. It is reminescent of the ranked multiplayer of Halo2 - TrueSkill I think it was. It may or may not exist, I couldn't tell if I was getting put with lower ranked players or not. But I did notice this. In all the Control games, there was a whole lot less to gain by actually controlling areas on the map as compared with Battlefield. In Destiny's Control (aka Titanfall Hardpoint, Domination etc) controlling map points serves more as a means to figure out where enemy players are headed so you can intercept and kill them rather than something that gains you actual points for time spent controlling them. That's something very unbalanced and wrecks the spirit of an actual game of Control / Domination / Hardpoint, but I can see why it would be that way for a Beta. 

**Loot Glorious Loot**  
We now finally have the answer to the dreaded term 'microtransaction' and the answer is NO. The economy of Destiny makes sense. You get out there into the world and you gain XP and loot by downing the adversaries. So much loot is available that you can pile up cash just discarding unneeded and redundant or underpowered items. I still don't know what the hell to do with all my spinmetal, and I just figured out that I could buy special and heavy ammo to tote with me in PvE combat. So maybe when the Grimoires are un-redacted I'll get a better understanding of all that. But I'll tell you this, the collecting of stuff and things in Destiny works great. I love the Cryptarch concept and like the implementation of chance in getting a special loot drop rather than knowing that some drudges will play one note forever to buy and craft. So far, so good even though I _cannot_ get a good pair of boots to match my cape.

I did get enough level 9 and level 10 stuff as a level 8 to not sweat the details of leveling up many of my weapons, but it took me a while to see that weapons themselves get XP and not just me. I just wanted one of everything and didn't spend enough time on one until the Crucible focused my mind onto ultimately a 61 Scout Rifle and 57 Shotty. 

Anyway that's all for today.

### [On the Multiculturalization of Superheroes](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2014/07/on-the-multiculturalization-of-superheroes.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201a3fd339cad970b-pi)I'm all for it. Except the 'it' I'm talking about ain't happening. Far be it from me to be a champion of diversity, but where it actually matters, ie genuine heroics, it seems to me that Marvel and others have got it all wrong. 

Now I'll be the first to tell you that I'm not a big comic fan, but I have seen enough to know that of all the creative media in the world, comics are unleashed in an extraordinary way. It almost seems to be a lost art, a kind of storytelling (if and when I find the literary gold) that goes beyond text towards a realm just visual enough to spark the imagination in ways that TV and movies just cannot. But I'm certain this has been much better said by others with some dog years in the critical game. I'm a newb. But I do know something about your standard American superheroes. I wasn't born yesterday. 

So when I hear that the next Captain America is going to be a black man, the new Green Lantern is gay and the next Thor is a woman.. Well I wasn't born yesterday. I've got emotional baggage with those old supers and I don't like seeing them flipped. Now I can't say with definition that there are not righteous in-situ ways of explaining the changes, even though I thought Thor was immortal. It makes sense that old caped crusaders die off and new ones don the mask. But isn't that nothing at all but cliche?

Granted, there's an important tradition of emergent minorities, and don't get me wrong, there's something very appealing about the right [black man becoming the new Captain America](http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/16/5878527/marvel-is-replacing-steve-rogers-with-the-first-black-captain-america). But it would be nice if he had a choice - that is to say, if your intent is to diversify heroism, why not diversify it? Why not build a new house instead of just having a new different person move into the old house? Wait, stop. I know the answer - it's about a black man becoming President of the United States of America, as contrasted with HNIC. Yes I get that. Still, why not have a new kind of hero with a new kind of power in a new situation?

Now I'm at the end of my rope. I can't say much more because I can't tell from experience how this may or may not have worked before. Obviously the old Justice League is in desparate need of a shakeup. And OMG, if Bruce Banner was a black scientist who got wrongly fired from NASA by a false claim from a white woman on sexual harrassment, that kind of rage would make the Incredible Hulk really frightening. But I'm still kind of freaking out over my discovery this week of [Ravenhammer.com](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/games_gamers/www.ravenhammer.com). An independent black comic is really giving me images that I never saw before, and probably you too. I think I'd like to see some of these alternative supers a chance to script outside the box. And so this is my invitation to see for myself as well.

### [Die Another Way](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2014/06/die-another-way.html)

I've been thinking about the different ways to die in a Bungie shooter or any video game, and I think that the most satisfying kills are those that uniquely humiliate the target. So far they have been the assasinations in Gears and in Halo. But there has always been something special about Halo's deadly purple needler explosions that are utterly unique in gaming. So I'm wondering.. If I had the skills of a Bungie progammer, what kind of super unique kills might I animate that haven't been seen in any other videogame?

Now interestingly, I have a set of ideas based in physics about how you destroy something. Sooner or later in life, you'll find an unopenable can or something stuck that you cannot open - and you think, how can it be with all the forces of physics that I can't get this open? So, yeah. I have a list that makes me think of extremes of temperature, air pressure, water pressure, torque, vibration, sound, sharpness, etc.

So today I'm putting on my twisted thinking cap to imagine some ridiculous weapons.

**Liquifaction** Being reduced to a crap stain on the ground, or a puddle of goo has got to be in the list. But we all just think of acid, and it's always green and hissy. Now what might just work here is an acid blob gun with a great animation. But what about an acid blob shotgun that shoots out two dozen baggies the size of gumballs? Each acid gumball sticks to you and then they all simultaneously pop and dissolve you in all those places.

**Implosion** How about a vacuum magazine for a sniper rifle? Instead of a bullet, it's a dart with a total vacuum. It hits your head, your head implodes like a stomped on soda can.

**Filament Shredder** For close quarters, a shotgun like weapon that shoots out a bolo net. The net goes through you like a cheese cuber, and the you are a pile of ingredients for a chunky Denver Omlette.

**Fireworker** Here's a weapon that shoots like an RPG. But as the projectile gets close, it lassos your leg and then jerks you up ragdoll style as if you were a mortar. It reaches apogee and boom, you're a red flower.

**Spastic Balloon** Just like the Fireworker except it drags you all random all over the sky or ground like, you know, a spastic balloon.

**Harpoon** Yeah we've seen this before in Cel Damage, but there's nothing quite so satisfying as seeing an impaled body fly into the nearest wall. Sick, no? Yes.

**Taster's Choice** Oooh. Here's a weapon the instantly freeze-dries all the water in your body. Boom, you're Lot's Wife. A pillar of salt.

**F5** Who wouldn't want to have a tornado in a can? I think it would make for a really cool grenade. Not quite so deadly, but it can throw you 30 feet. Then again, that depends on where you land doesn't it?

**Mortification** There's something classic about how the Ark of the Covenant made skeletons out of the Nazi's in that first Indiana Jones movie. Any animation that rots out a body down to the bones has got to be cool.

### [Eighty Two](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2014/04/eighty-two.html)

  
[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201b7c7becd30970b-pi)I just assume that it's all about 1982, so I put on a white shirt, skinny black tie and my clubmans [Falling Down](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106856/) style and headed to the bar EightyTwo in DTLA. 

I got the high score on PacMan and three replays on Centaur. I had an Oban. I puffed a little vapor and I sorta dug the music which was and was not retro, but it was certainly loud. I met my brothers and Pops and for the time we weren't somewhat peeved that nobody in the joint cared a whit about putting the UConn game on, we had a ball at EightyTwo, the new 'barcade'. 

What's strange at this moment is that although I feel like I could talk for hours about pinball and arcade videogames, I really don't feel like it. I mean basically the chick who owns the pinball machines kinda put me right in my place. I know I'm never going to step up and buy a pinball machine, even my favorite of all time, Bow & Arrow. And I know I'm never going to know more than 80% of what's worth knowing about what I kinda know. Like I eyeballed a machine that was built circa 1977 and I nailed that, but as she said, I was mostly right but wrong on the details. When I was 20 years old, I could have written a disertation of electromechanical pinball and arcade video games. I'm sure that I have spent something on the order of $2500 a year in quarters when I was in my Virtua Fighter championship form. But.. 

I'm out of joint and feeling somewhat weird about my relationships to the machines now that it has come around to this upscale hip joint that looks like it could have fallen off the back porch of the Standard Hotel. I popped at a million points on Centaur and turned to say, "At least machines have paid me more than I've paid them", which is true. Computers have been very very good to me. But I had several of those unbelievably low scoring balls and my typical movement of disgust was all there in muscle memory - never striking the glass, spinning around in place with my arms flailing in agony, but not wide enough to strike the next pinballer over, and never tilting in anger. It was the familiar frustration made unfamiliar by the whiskey. I never used to drink and game.

I'm all ready to drink and game if I can find the right friend to come with me. But I never have. I've always been, with very few exceptions, the lone gamer, the pickup gamer. It was never me and my crew, it was always me meeting the regulars at the arcade. Young men like myself known only by first name, if that, and their reputations as foosballers, or fighters. Whether it was Holiday Bowl on Crenshaw or Mr. Motos right across the street, or Sega Center at the Fox Hills Mall. Maybe it was Shatto Bowl or the legendary on Woody's on Figueroa. Midtown Bowl had a pretty good lineup but there was a great arcade across the street from LACC. Down on Broadway, I dropped a lot of quads, especially on Defender, yike. 

My love affair with the arcades of the city is bittersweet of course. The social rules and rewards of arcade fighting games like Mortal Combat was a later phenomenon. I already was bathed in the solitude of pinball and of the digital cabinet games. It matters to get a high score on PacMan and there is that retro cinematic moment when you could stand back and have a few admirers, but as sad and lonely as it seemed in the movie Tron it was more desolate in life. We are the Tron generation and it is not entirely a happy thing to see the popularity of our old obsessions brought to life. It's a little bit shameful, at least for someone my age. There's no such baggage for the XBox generation, and I hope they enjoy and discover what joy we knew from those moments of finding treasure in Gauntlet, dodging sprites in Robotron or jumping that bridge correctly in Dragon's Lair. The social experience of an arcade has changed with the advent of Dave & Busters and now these new upscale hip joints. It's a lot less depressing than it used to be when arcades were on the outskirts of society.

Gaming is now a huge industry beyond the dreams of us older kids. I am amazed. EightyTwo. I'll be back.

### [Destiny Speculation: Open World Missions](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2014/03/destiny-speculation-open-world-missions.html)

Well, actually this is about what I want to see Destiny do in its open world. I want it to approach the compelling narrative of Red Dead Redemption and Fallout 3. I think that asking for Elder Scrolls levels is not going to come until Destiny 2, at which point the depth of the legendary backstories will have soaked in, as well as with fan fiction and hopefully a good book by Greg Bear.  

I know Bungie don't like to hear 'RPG' but as beautiful as the environments are so far, if Destiny doesn't get a lot of open world missions going, then I will be disappointed. That is to say that if it's strictly Halo-like in terms of the pursuit of enemies leading you around the map, then it won't work as well as I think it should.

So here's what I'm thinking, in short spurts.

**A. Task Areas**  
Some kind of areas should be 'task' areas. That is to say you should be able to travel to a place in the open world and hang out there doing a number of tasks and returning to that same place. I think of the big farm way up the hill in Red Dead Redemption. Catch a runaway horse. Stop a barn fire. Tame a mustang. In Destiny task areas could be similar with the occasional alien enemy making a pest out of themselves. 

In Old Russia, one could be tasked to find 5 car tires or mechanical doohickies from that stream of abandoned wrecks. Or maybe you need to find spare parts for your own ship in the Cosmodrome. Wow, now that I think of that, I can't see how that would not be a simple first mission depending upon how much of a chickenchaser they make your newb Guardian. 

I can imagine you finding some old derelict Awoken codger out in the airplane graveyard cooking a greasy piece of meat in the fuselage of an old A380. Which now that I think of it, what other kinds of creatures does earth have besides birds? What do the Fallen eat? Maybe they eat horses and we have a horse escort mission. Meh, I hated driving cattle in Red Dead, but horse roping from a Shrike might be cool.

**B. Traditional Dungeons**  
Other areas should be like traditional 'dungeons', where you go into creepy surroundings in order to retrieve some strange artifact. In these, everything is what you would expect and I'm rather taken by the rules of engagment set by Skyrim and Fallout 3. The first time through the dungeon, if it is visible and accessible to you, presents a challenge as part of a narrative and it it leveled up to your skillset. Upon subsequent passed through there should be a modicum of sameness, but the challenge should be of a different shape after a set number of visits.

I'm thinking in particular of my favorite dungeon in Skyrim that was guarded by two daedric princes - you know those devil looking guys. There was always lots of gold and some high quality weapons there, and if you could beat the two daedra, then you were set. It would have been nice if on the third try the game threw in a completely different set of enemies and loot to throw me off balance. 

**C. Wandering Prizes**  
I think it would be cool for you to be aware of some kind of loot or achievement that doesn't exist in one place for long. Or maybe it's like soap, if you don't grab it successfully, it squirts out of your hand to a new location, except in Destiny that location might be through a transport portal. I like the idea of perhaps one of those scary little girls who appear out of nowhere and tell you to follow them and it ends up being something really trippy. "How did you get that cape?" "From the girl in the pink tutu on Venus, near the laboratory".

### [Ghosts](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2014/02/ghosts.html)

Call of Duty Ghosts is the most infantile game I've played in a long time. In the single player campaign, over and over I keep being reminded that I'm supposed to be a teenaged boy who loves his dad and his dog and will do anything to hear "I'm proud of you, son".  The most implausible set of episodes that include tanks that explode from one shot, guns that can be found anywhere in a jungle, and a dozen battleships in 50 feet of water off the coast of Santa Monica. Yike. 

Yeah. I hated the underwater combat, and I hated the space combat. What should have been an interesting challenge by changing the speed at which my character moved turned out to be just frustration.. There's not much else to say. I'm sending it back to Gamefly.

### [Ogre](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2013/12/ogre.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e2019b02bfd578970d-pi)I met Bruce Sterling at UCLA somewhen about 1989. It was before I moved to New York and before the founding of the EFF. I had three distinct impressions. 

1. Dude was scary smart.

2. Dude was scary rebellious.

3. Dude looked way too young to know what he knew.

If I had finished up at USC as I planned, there was no question that I would have eventually fallen in with the dudes at the Swamp, the fairly well known geek hangout. I would have met a dungeonmaster. I would have been deeply into D&D. As it stood, I failed to make the connection. But since I had the audacity to write games in FORTRAN and found something fundamentally fascinating about bi-directional printing, then I would have been a lot more likely to trade the privilege of running USC's data centers for the sort of rebellious pose characterizing the name Bruce Sterling evokes. I liked him and I agreed with everything he said, but I think he had a lot of nerve to be poking his finger at those he did. Rich white boy. 

I didn't have time for that. I was working very hard for respectability in a society I didn't comprehend. I saw him as somebody throwing vases against the walls of his parents estate. Of course it didn't matter whether or not his parents had an estate, or how precise his aim. Destruction is destruction. I was a black man living every day life as a symbolic threat. He looked like Spritle Racer with acne. All he had to do was shut his mouth and he disappeared. I did not have that luxury in 1989.

Today I saw a picture of a box about the size of a carom table. Inside was a game called Ogre from a company named Steve Jackson Games. I read The Hacker Crackdown when I lived in Brooklyn two or three years after meeting Sterling. I thought of most cyber stuff about the way I thought of 'Lawnmower Man', severly lacking in aesthetic value with very little appeal outside of that which is given by a good crossword puzzle. I was one of those people who at once desired the distinction of belonging to Mensa or the Triple Nine and yet found the distinction worthless if not annoyingly alienating. I dug those like Feynman from a distance. I never had my own personal college professor. 

My friend Bryan Alexander digs ghosts and, well horror and scary stories. He's a college professor who lives in close proximity to nature and the understanding that what humans build, nature takes apart. He understands the moral dimension of destruction and failure and while he doesn't get all post-modern about it, he gets the deconstructional narrative of grand guinol. There's probably no better person on the planet to talk about the implications of the rise of Zombie Apocalypse stories in America. Bryan knows the literature, backwards and forwards.

I've begun to purposefully pay more attention to Bryan and he has been very kind in mentioning me by name over the past few weeks on Facebook. This is fortuitous because I have come around to the side of destruction, in the necessity of it. I've been knowing about Cthulhu for a long time, but I only recently decided to read what that fiction was all about. Somewhere between the fictional Mountains of Madness and the actual endurance of Shackleton is everything that human beings need to know at this moment in history. 

It was Bryan who took the picture of Ogre. As soon as I saw the logo of Steve Jackson Games, it took me back to the days in which the existential dilemma of being a young black urban sophisticate wrestling daily with call of cyber geekdom. I have been neither as both simultaneously, half-tracking through the woods of identity. Enough to be in it and called of it, distrusting both and unable to escape either. And in all that, no compelling need to *be* a rebel. Even now. Steve Jackson Games was persecuted by the US Secret Service. It said something profound about the imagination of the cyber and the warfare and secrets deeply implied in the strategic and tactical thinking of gamers, coders, warriors and spies. 

I am a console gamer. Skyrim is everything Dungeons and Dragons wanted to be, and in the imagination of those at the USC Swamp, I'm sure they inhabited the mind of the Dragonborn so many years ago. I can't say I feel jealous - I have had the ultimate dungeonmaster expressed as the world created by Bethesda for my XBox 360. And I stand in awesome anticipation of the next journey called Destiny, which is coming next September from the acknowledged master masters, the crafters of Master Chief, Bungie. There is the possibility that I will live in that world. There is the likelihood that in my dotage, I will remain in such worlds at nearly infinite stretches of imaginary time. I will experience all the destruction I might be able to handle and having it all realized, I will be ready to die.

I have raised a family. It's difficult for me to imagine Bruce Sterling married with children, but that may be so. Nevertheless, I don't entertain dreams of purpose dedicated to attacking the System, but of living in better worlds. Like Professor Farnsworth, I'm much more likely to become sick of the planet and go find a new one. I think of destruction as the thing that compels people to know reality, as the noose focuses the mind. But I am by nature a defender. I am the big brother without whose dependents I lack purpose. If nobody read Cobb, I wouldn't write it, much. I'd keep to myself, I imagine.

Adventure games are literature puzzles. Chess. Risk. D&D. I see these as things for people who don't actually know karate. Karate is stochastic and involves real risk. When you have to think about getting actually punched in the face, it's not so much fun to be a rebel. 

No conclusion. Just observations kicked off from a picture from a friend.

### [GTA5 & The Soulful Gangster Problem](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2013/09/the-soulful-gangster-problem.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e2019aff81cefa970c-pi)I am laughing out loud at [GTA5](http://www.rockstargames.com/V/ "Grand Theft Auto V") and enjoying myself about six hours into it. So far so good.

[Leigh Alexander at Gamesutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/200648/Opinion_The_tragedy_of_Grand_Theft_Auto_V.php) has poured a bit of cold criticism on the game, piquing my attention. I think, wanting for 'monsters', she has done little else but demonstrate that she doesn't like the lack of imagination that *is* the gangster genre. Where GTA5 allows you to do a ridiculous amount of stuff that have nothing to do with mayhem, mayhem is really what video game drama offers the player, outside of plot. If you don't like having the protagonist of a gangster film deliver mayhem for its own sake, you're in dangerous territory.

I have gone on for some length about how morally degrading it is to invited to care about a real 3D character who keeps committing evil actions. It is the signature of Hollywood's best creations since the startling invention of Tony Soprano whom I call a [scumbag protagonist](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2009/08/two-dirty-bags-of-drama.html). The skewering question nobody bothers to ask is why doesn't [Walter White] just quit doing evil? Why doesn't he just walk away? But they don't, and this is the manipulation and plot device that keeps the gangster genre ticking - that and the fact that the protagonist preternaturally avoids death long enough for the audience to experience repetitive thrills, chills and spills.

GTA5's integration of its open world with its 'rails' is very nicely done, as a bit of technical kit. No load screens is a big deal. But I think the reason that GTA5 fails to engage you in its open world is precisely because Los Santos is boring. It's LA and LA in a very stereotypical way. The Westside is the 'Westside' and South Central is 'South Central'. LA was more well done, quite frankly in Midnight Club. But on the other hand, everybody gushed about just riding a horse through Red Dead Redemption - because the Old West it presented was interesting and mysterious in its own right. So was Skyrim. So was Fallout3's Wastes. I think that criticism of GTA5 on all literary levels is happening because the gaming world understands what Bungie has teased us into understand. The shooter genre needs heroism, and heroism requires the right environment. Nobody knows how to be a hero in gritty LA. Dramtically speaking, I don't think that problem has ever been solved, not even by Bill Cosby in the remake of Neil Simon's California Suite. 

GTA5 gives us what LA gives us, what is so far, an excellent big bada boom slapstick platformer with characters who are interesting enough, but not too interesting that you actually care that they might have souls. In American fiction, nobody in LA has a soul outside of Phillip Marlowe, and you're not too sure about him. These days, you have to go to New Mexico for soul, meaning Breaking Bad. Watching Walter White's family being destroyed is poison because they have souls. That is where the damage is done to the audience. I have not yet peeked at what level of monstrous acts Breaking Bad has delivered this season but I remain interested in pursuing the wacky hijinks and dirty jokes of GTA5 inured as I am.  Sooner or later all of this ends up being Saint's Row. It is inevitable.

I have played Saint's Row 4 by the way, and I'm about to send it back to Gamefly. It's far too clunky for me to enjoy in the context of GTA5, and the degree of outrageousness has set me up to enjoy the Rockstar's brand of 'subtle' humor a bit more. Still, found myself in Los Santos / San Andreas wanting my character to be able to climb walls and plant explosive charges as I have been doing the past few weeks with Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell Blacklist. But I've got to do what my GTA characters actually can do, which is drive around this cartoon LA and fall into plots. So the dramatic tension has just begun as I have started the arc of engaging in crime again as Michael. I'm already a good driver as Franklin and I haven't yet met my third personality. Thar be adventures a'waitin me hearties, but I'll not be spendin' 'em with human beings. Yo ho ho it's the cartoon violence for me.

### [Halo Moments](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2013/07/halo-moments.html)

I've spent a lot of time in a number of virtual places but now I'm thinking about legendary (heh) moments in the Halo Universe. What are they?

I think the most memorable experiences in Halo had to do with the first time I saw a Scarab in New Mombasa. It was the largest, most unbeatable looking beast. The way the scene was setup so that the Marines around you were crapping their pants and it took several minutes to beat this monster was rather outsized for Halo. It was a boss battle that didn't seem like a boss battle. 

I thought it was very dramatic the first time I played 'Truth & Reconciliation' with the sniper rifle at night, crawling among the Covenant and trying to remain quiet all the while working my way actually up into the alien ship. 

In Halo3, coming out of the jungle to the enemy installation and watching Sgt Johnson fighting against a brute through the scope of my sniper rifle. Heart pumping.

One of the craziest co-op moments were in ODST when you played the guy with the rocket launcher and you hod to fight with vehicles to destroy Wraiths all over this mountainous terrain. Running around in the warthog and trying to beat the enemies on that map was a real hoot. 

Seeing UNSC ships in atmosphere is always super dramatic as are the large-scale invasions. So the cut-scene when the In Amber Clad drops the Master Cheif a Scorpion. Awesome. Also the first time I  ever got to pilot a Banshee had to be a stellar moment.

The rest is like trying to come up with the Top 10 maps, each of which had a special conflict or types of conflict that were designed into the gameplay. So let me remember maps - and I'm going to do this alongside [this squeaker's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COUW6ApiAGc).

- Everybody desparately wanted to get the shotgun in the underground grotto of **Snowbound**. Crazy grenade battles in that room.
- For **Tempest** and **Ridgeline**, the best thing to be was an invisible sniper. 
- Sword battles on **The Pit** were awesome. Getting gunned down by the turrets was always a big frustration. This was a great place to have a needler and a pistol. 
- **Countdown** had epic CQ battles at the top of the big lift in back. I could almost always get first strike at the beginning if I got the needler first on the other side of the map.
- The **Exile** map from Halo4 is simply a masterpiece. Best map ever for Domination, and that includes similar gametypes across COD and Ghost Recon. 
- **Last Resort**: What can I say? Sniping from the sniper hole. Gunning from the turret. Ghost splatters and warthog domination. De in the top 5 most memorable maps.
- **Settler** is a great map, one of the first in Halo that makes you think about actual infantry tactics. The high ground is a bottleneck, so you have soldiers streaming in from all over the map just to get that one place. I think this map has seen more destroyed Warthogs than any other.
- On **Guardian**, everybody wants the hammer, or to snipe down the tunnel where the hammer is found. Plus, exploding walls! 
- **Battle Creek** would probably not fare well against more recent Halo maps, but the invisibility and the rocket launcher made for some crazy exchanges on this tiny map. It's Halo 101. **Hang 'em High**, I hated. 
- Vehicle battles abound on **Sandtrap**. Best vehicle map ever. If you don't have one, you won't last long.
- **Lockout** is a fan favorite. Blackout and other reproductions don't quite cut it, so it's greatness has been lost.

Interestingly enough, I do agree with the squeaker's top three choices, **Valhalla/Ragnarok**, **High Ground** and **Blood Gulch**. These are legendary maps in the Halo franchise. I cannot sing enough praises to High Ground for map design and weapon & vehicle placement. When I think of Halo's promise of 30 seconds of high energy fun and then you die and come back for another 30 seconds, High Ground is that map. It is the map that matches weapon finds with the territory - you basically *must* get to the lookout and grab the Spartan laser, or you *must* run for the dual weilding SMGs or get the bubble sheild and shoot the guy trying to get the SMGs. Or you *must* get inside the bunker and use the spikers, or get around to the backside and grab the energy drain, or get to the turret. It was a very deterministic map with guaranteed action. 

Valhalla and Blood Gulch on the other hand were wide open spaces that really leant themselves to being exploited by player skill and team coordination. If you couldn't call an audible and marshal your forces to one stronghold or another on these maps, you were doomed. I have to say in all fairness, One Bomb on Blood Gulch became a little tiresome in the way it was predictable, but for the Big Team Battles, these exemplify greatness in a way that no other maps have. I'm giving the nod to Valhalla/Ragnarok whose longevity into Halo4 makes it the best.

### [XBox One: More Than Hardware](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2013/05/xbox-one-more-than-hardware.html)

My friend Iz says XBox One sounds like a PS3 because now it has BluRay. Iz is not a gamer.

XBox is going to be a lot more used as the input to my big screen. I already do Netflix through it, now I see reasons to do more through it. I've never really thought of XBox competition to PlayStation - all the most important titles come out on all platforms so that has never been an issue. I do find the XBox controller superior to all others though.

The real loser today is AppleTV. I have one and MSFT has come up with what I think is a winning gesture and voice controlled interface between regular television and gaming. XBox One looks to be everything but the DVR, which it could do in the cloud. I call this a strategic win for Microsoft based on a vision that has been pretty much right on for years.

The huge news is that MSFT, 343 and Steven Speilberg are going to produce a live action Halo series through XBox One. This is a big obvious win that everybody has been wanting for years and now is going to finally happen. The significance of it is not lost. Microsoft has built the road between gaming and Hollywood AND the NFL. And part of that, I think, has a lot to do with (in retrospect) whether I could envision Steve Jobs hanging out with the guys at EA and Infinity Ward and UFC other entertainment types. The answer is no, Jobs wanted to be bigger and better than all of them and the center of attention. Now today it looks like more business as usual without godlike presences actually doing business in a normal way, and the acceptance of people in movies and TV saying that XBox is a real channel for content. It simply doesn't seem weird, risky or hyped any longer. That's way different than a BluRay compatible sticker on hardware that could be built anywhere. That's the job that neither Sony nor Nintendo nor Apple nor Samsung could do, and it has been, in my opinion, Microsoft's best run business for a long time.

The XBox One looks exactly the way I want it. Black and shiny, low profile and slick. Something that looks like it belongs in a well-furnished modern living room. Depending on what the kit is, I might even be willing to spend $500 bucks on it, which kind of pisses me off because I really don't have as much of an appetite for gaming as I used to. But as much as I love what FIOS has done, they really cannot compete with gesture and voice recognition control of my big screen. There has been a balance of power in my living room between AppleTV, XBox 360 and FIOS and that balance has just been pushed a little bit further towards the XBox. 

The details are where it matters. For example, a lot of cell phone multitouch control was demonstrated today. That means an IOS app if it means anything to me. How much is Apple doing with 'Smartglass'? I forget. If in fact the XBox One will have DVR powers locally or in the cloud, with whom will they partner. I heard Comcast mentioned but not Verizon. XBox.com mentions "HDMI pass-thru" which is just what I want, if it does the common sense thing. When I'm waiting in a gaming lobby, I want to pop back to TV or music and I want it to pop back the moment the lobby goes to game. 

Obligatorily, I have to say about this 'always on internet' mess. It's peasant bodewash and I'm really sick of hearing it. Everybody always wants internet always on, just like electricity and the fact of the matter is that nobody turns on their XBox and then turns off the internet. Anyway, my take is exactly like the take of the Orthy guy or whatever his name was. If you don't want the internet, something's wrong with you. Don't spend the hundreds. Shut up and mail a post-card. 

What will be more interesting is how much will all of those Azure services provide in terms of the same library of content we all want, and this is where Apple and Amazon still may have cards to play. So let's be frank about it shall we? Even though Netflix is the big gorilla, there's a ton of stuff they just don't have that somebody out there has. And all this new content pretty much hits at the same time - in fact it's getting annoying when I see the movie art on AppleTV and it's not available to rent yet, only buy. There is, for me, about zero upside in movie ownership. Which is weird (because I haven't studied why) considering that I think nothing of spending for a digital book whether audio or document. I very much like the Audible subscription model as well as the O'Reilly model. My purhcases are eternal and I physically possess them as well has having their library as backup. But movies.. not so much. Anyway, my point is that there is a lot of video archival footage and whatnot that I really would like to dig out and view but not own - and I kinda thought that's where Apple was going. Every episode of the Flintstone and the Gilligan's Island, for example. A huge TV archive. But that hasn't happened. So if the economics aren't there, and what's been proven is that everybody wants to rent new movies and recent TV series, then there is no reason why MSFT shouldn't get into that business with the exception that they are presently exclusived out of it because of deals made with Hulu, Vudu, Roku etc. So it seems to me that now is the time for XBox One to get into the movie action - or perhaps never.

Speaking of which, Vimeo and YouTube. I guess those are the back doors. XBox One really should have YouTube. There's no excuse. More legal hate, I'm sure. 

A few other things. My gamer friends list should be infinite. There's no way I should have to be limited to 100. XBox Live needs to fix that right away.

### [The Next XBox](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2013/05/the-next-xbox.html)

The most important thing about the next XBox is that it has decent USB support and a fat local disk. I expect MSFT to do the right thing with regards to memory and processing power - obviously all of the Unreal and world-builder types are the real customers for that stuff so the really can't screw that up. What they can screw up is peripheral support, as if we really need some new proprietary doofus interface for controllers and disk. If I have to buy some $50 mojo to move my current game content over to the new box, I'm going to wait as long as possible to upgrade.   
  
If it has a BluRay, yay, big deal. Just don't make me pay for it. BluRay players are 60 bucks at Sears.   
If it has cloud storage I won't use it, especially if I have to pay.   
If there's a new controller style, I'll be skeptical but not cynical. They did well in the change from the original XBox.  
If it doesn't support 1080p I'll be shocked.  
  
What would be cool:   
- A Destiny demo  
- 5.1 stereo support  
- HDMI cable included  
- Frontside USB (because I always need to charge my iPhone)  
  
What would be stupid  
- 3D anything  
- Bundled Pricing for current Live subscribers  
- Any price point over 300 bucks for the basic box (with big disk)  
  
What I would do (and I know would never happen)  
- Offer a full integrated stereo amp with HDMI & RCA jacks.  
- Offer XBox on a Board for PC gamers  
- Open Source arduino kits & usb kits for the XBox Controller  
- iTunes Store integration  
- Google Play integration  
- Amazon Shopping Integration  
- PayPal Integration INSTEAD of Microsoft Points  
  
What I couldn't possibly care less about  
- Skype  
- XBMC  
- Social Media integration

### [Bungie Destiny: Speculation One](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2013/05/bungie-destiny-speculation-one.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201901bceba5e970b-pi)I am already extraordinarily excited about the next videogame from Bungie, Destiny. Halo was the first videogame that made me take videogames seriously all those many years ago. They took Halo to the next level multiple times, and when you consider the ways they have gone, including Halo Wars and ODST, there's a lot you know they can do. 

One of the most impressive things the Bungie guys can do is design a multiplayer battlefield that you want to play over and over. I really enjoyed learning about the story about how they used heatmaps based on real play to find where killzones were located. Since I have been playing Halo 4, now taken over faithfullly by the excellent team at 343 Industries, it's clear that there is more than enough Halo lore to keep that impressive gameplay quality alive. And so I will be doing some speculations about what I expect to see and what I like to see.

**Big Team Battle Goes Massive**  
One of the most awesome and impressive gaming I've ever done, considering that I have never played in any MMO, was a 16 on 16 battle in one of those WW2 sims. I want to guess that it was an early Call of Duty but I don't recall. What I do remember was the shape of the battlefield and all that. I would play, literally for hours on end, with my same squads until there were places we could master, but even then we could be surprised. A classic battlefield will draw players in over and over, and whomever manages to own that territory can gain cred.

So imagine if you will, Halo players, a battlefield something on the order of Valhalla / Ragnarok which is a gateway to an even larger battlefield. In order to get to the larger battlefield, which is of strategic value to the game, you must play a Halo style big team battle with respawns putting you back. You press the enemy and lines of battle determine where you respawn.  

We know that Bungie is building seven planets. So I suppose we can guess that there are maybe 10 battlefields per planet. I don't even want to think about space battles, but I'm sure that after Reach, the Bungie guys are itching to do that as well. Just think about that. Seventy maps all with big team battles, each with its own set of unique obstacles and rewards. That's what I'm talking about. 

--

**Forgo Forge**  
I started watching some old Bungie viDocs and I can't tell you how tiresome it was listening to the guys brag about Forge and Forgeworld. Please don't bog down the game with a bunch of Forge crap. It's like the rap stars that tell the audience to say 'Ho!'. I didn't pay money to say Ho, you're the entertainer, not me. Say Ho your damned self. Build the worlds, dude. Or just open source the whole damned engine, because we don't want amateur hour, we want professional design. If you don't want to design the world, give up all your tools to another studio. 

That said, if you build a map that sucks, nuke it. We're talking a 10 year game lifespan. Nukes happen. 

If you do a top ten of all the greatest Halo maps, you will get 20 consistent answers. So there was a time that I hoped to see a best of map pack. I'd love to play The Pit or Zanzibar or any number of the old school maps in Halo. It's kind of what I expected when the Anniversary Edition came out and Bungie showed they could repupose old content. Based on that theory alone, Destiny could be astounding.

Right now however, on any given day all the great maps on Halo 4 are getting play only during Big Team Battles. On a hot weekend, you see maybe 7500-11000 players. I know there's competition with Gears of War right now, but that's the best maps. New DLC is getting no play, and those are great maps too. So please don't bog down the new Sol System with bootleg factories for crowdsourcing maps. You'll rue the day. Halo isn't a god game, it's a shooter. Destiny had better not be a god game.

I found the original Bioshock exactly that boorish because of the thin veneer of ideology which was so one [](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e2017d4251ee9d970c-pi)dimensional that it failed utterly to give any depth to the excellent art direction. I had hardly taken a step into the world when I get monologued to death by what amounted to an interrupted carnival barker. Hey I opened a door, ooh check that out, uh oh here comes that stupid voice over. It was so ham handed as compared to say.. well the other excellent FPS/RPGs that I just couldn't put up with it. Arriving on the train into City 17 in Half Life 2 was a miracle of immersion. Escaping execution from the burned out town in Skyrim, brilliant. Coming out of genetic rebuilding in Mass Effect, genius.

Infinite never raised my hope much further despite the very cool graphics - it stayed much too close to a politically mythical America to be useful. Nothing about the series has seemed sandboxy enough, and the invented universe simply didn't have enough resonances for me. Considering, for example, the historical verisimilitude of the latest [Assassin's Creed](http://www.assassinscreed.com/ "Assassin's Creed"), at least there's the net absence of the integral part of a meaningful role of the Assassin in the American Revolution. There's a kind of Groundhog Day irrelevance to all your passion, and Assassin's Creed is OK with that - or at least it is at it's best when not too much is made of the significance of your avatar's murderous rage. The same thing can be said of the deft denouement of Skyrim. Even after you've contributed to solving the world's problems, the world still exists, with new problems. Mass Effect, not so much.

To be fair, these are inordinately complex problems to solve. The narrative has to get you going, especially when your character is too weak to beat up an ordinary policeman or guard. Some successful games ignore the problem altogether. Here is the world, here are the badguys, here's the stereotypical mission and you badass your way through. That can be loads of fun, witness games like Mercenaries 2, or Borderlands.

[Deus Ex](http://www.last.fm/music/Ion%2BStorm/Deus%2BEx "Deus Ex") is rather the exception that proves the rule. Or rather I should say, it's a very well done game that forces you to think differently about FPS/RPGs. As a moral exercise, I simply found it too challenging. There were too many ethically gray areas that I was forced to put my avatar through - and I did find that realistic. It made me feel as though there is no real way to be heroic if you were actually endowed with such powers. It made you feel the limits, and if you are a serious gamer and take what happens to your avatar seriously, Deus Ex will put you through some emotional changes. Lying, cheating, stealing and killing in Deus Ex, takes a toll (or it did on me).

The other game that made me feel something like that was [GTA San Andreas](http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/ "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas"). It got really revolting to be the bad guy. It was something -- well I've never had the stomach to watch Clockwork Orange all the way through -- I imagine to being akin to being brainwashed. The rewards for any positive moral behavior in the game are washed out of your system, and it being a [sandbox game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world "Open world"), you can't even pretend to be motivated by the arc of the story. There was none.

Obviously I see a world of sociological and psychological discussion in the universes that game designers create. And it is that angle that has always struck me as being a blindspot for a lot of the game criticism that gave such high marks to the artistic merits of the BioShock series.

### [Bloody Pirates!](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2013/03/bloody-pirates.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e2017ee8e5ddac970d-pi)Well I just finished **Assassin's Creed III** and it was fairly enjoyable for a time. And then I killed the last dude but it didn't let me do anything more. Evidently, the whole running around in the present day cave thing had something to do with it. I have to say that the tag team between the ghost women was probably the worst thing I have ever seen in the series. I played the whole putting the power cube into place and watching the cut scene thing on mute and listened the the beginning of my new Alastair Reynolds book. I put in the last block watched one more cutscene and then the whole thing ended. If I never hear another Assassins vs Templars conspiracy theory it will be too soon. Drop that whole thing. 

Here's my suggestion. Let's say that the Animus technology after the murder of whomever it was we killed, fell into the hands of some Anonymous hackers who then open sourced the code and now 3D printed several Animii. Now anybody can go back in time to any period of history filled with bloody violence and intrigue and step into character. Here's the thing, there was no time in this story where that whole premise of synching memories gave me more life bar or anything that I noticed. It was more all about crafting (2/3rds of which I never got around to) and buying better weapons. So really this whole freaking episode was horribly imbalanced as an RPG with levels. What it reminded me of more than anything else was Red Dead Redemption, which was bloody great. AC3 was great because the story was great, the animation was great and the main mission was great.

The fight engine is better than ever - better than Batman, better than in any other RPG even though Bethesda gets awesome props for their taking turn based fighting to the next level. The sea battles were groundbreaking AND awesome. Nobody has anything like it and I want more. The Assassin missions were very good, and the capturing sections of the cities was even more well done than in the previous editions. Climbing up steeples and trees to synch is getting pretty tired, but having oceans, remote islands, cities and wilderness - absolutely spot on. All the other modern day hokum is filler with one exception. Jumping around skyscrapers really does give me the shakes. You feel the fear of heights in AC3's skyscraper piece. I will say this, however. The only thing that could improve Assassins Creed's fighting system would be to add some cover and/or stealth features. That aspect of gameplay just seemed too much out of the control of the character. Give the Assassin a third of Sam Fisher's stealth tricks and you will have filled the fight engine thingy to perfection. 

So drop the hooey and give us more historical shitstorms to drop into and alter with our badassery. And what could be better for that than piracy? Oh perfect. And it just so happens that I watched [Treasure Island with Eddie Izzard](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1820723/), and it's probably the best pirate film ever - a great story done in two 90 minute segments. Everything else seems cheesy by comparison - kind of like what Saving Private Ryan did to WW2 movies. It borders on the imagination's rendering of the pirate adventures of Half Cocked Jack Shaftoe in **Neal Stephenson's Baroque Series**. (Which means Assassin's Creed 5 has to be Mongols and horse, sword & bow battle).  

Watching the preview video today gets me **_all_** ready for this. Some maroon at Forbes wants more Animus, but I say it's time to shitcan all the backgroundery and get straight to the intrique of the simulated world. All of that was necessary to setup the universe but the reach of the Templars and Assassins grows more tenuous and unbelievable in each further episoode. OK I think I've made my point. Blackbeard? Great. There's got to be ships of the Line of Battle involved and all that. So I know if any of you Ubi guys are reading this, you're going to want to read [David Davies](https://www.amazon.com/A-Brief-History-Fighting-Ships/dp/1841194697). 

And while I'm at it. let me suggest that you could probably spin off at least one more Master and Commander kind of game. Hey wait, there's a series isn't there? Hmm. I'm now newly  all into naval battles and there must be a huge amount of history to mine. Multiplayer naval battles? That's got to be pretty cool, and replication of wind patterns and all that in recreations of battles? Awesome. I will have to say that having your ship's crew cheer when all of the enemy is sunk is a new kind of exhilaration in video games. I have never played AC multiplayer but something on this nature.. I'd like that very much.

Anyway. Three cheers for Pirates!

### [Brownies & Boggarts & Sprites](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2012/09/brownies-boggarts-sprites.html)

Kingdoms of Amalur: The Reckoning is a combat RPG set in a vaguely familiar world of blathering humans, wanton devils, plotting gnomes, condescending fairies, and implacably territorial beasts, all mixed up into destabilized factions. The factions all use some arrogant spokesman to seduce you by honor into a plot to destroy their enemy whomever it will be, usually the devils and the beasts, while cursing and marveling at your ability to be the badass that you are. 

You wander from quest to quest, gathering nuts in May, keys, flowers, salts, loot, armor and weapons found in tree stums, rock piles and three variations of pirate chests 'o gold, some of which are booby cursed. 

The vaguely familiar world is massive, and lies in the midlands of modern three dimensional computer animation.  The world is filled with tudorish villages and medievalish castles and brackish swamps and caves. There are verdant fields with gigantic trees and ancient ruins, arid plains with dusty work camps and flooded mines, and boggy swamps with sour mists and oboes playing minor chords. 

And the creatures! Oh my heavens the creatures. There are three kinds of two headed giants, and two other kinds of giants aside from that. There are 30 foot beasts that slither three lengths in a fraction of a second belch up slimy procreations that hatch weilding tridents that shoot lightning. There are monsters whose faces split open vertically and spit green venomous clouds of stinking, stinging insects. There are shrieking black wraithes who dodge everything you throw at them and then come back from the near dead. There are glowing animate trees that fire corkscrewing roots at your feet and arrows of light at your face. And sometimes they gang up on you, with wolves, or bears, or brownies or massive doglike creatures with electric bites that drain your mana.

However.

In Kingdoms of Amalur: The Reckoning, you are the most badass, world wrecker in the realm. I can distinctly recall Blair Herter say that the fighting system for The Dark Knight was the most satisfying... HA and double HA. No Jedi or Sith, no Prince of Persia or God of War, no [Dragonborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonborn "Dragonborn"), combo ninja acrobat, Vault refugee nor Black Operative has weilded such destructive whoopass through any territory as.. as... whatever it is you named your elf. OK perhaps I exaggerate, but I can tell you without qualification, in the world of RPGs there has never been such an engaging fight system. Only Borderlands comes close. 

You see all of those beasts and quests are just an excuse for you to use bows, chakrams, longswords, greatswords, daggers, faeblades, ice traps, grenades, throwing knives, hammers, poisons and the traditional three elements of magic, fire, ice and lightning to hack, slash, bash, quake and incinerate your way through legions of hapless foes, and zombies too. 

It's the fightingest RPG of all time, but wait, theres more. 

You know how it is in every RPG, you choose a race and a bloodline and a primary skill and god and you level up and level up and level up. In this one, you can undo all of your skill points and re-level up from scratch. Even the weapons that you embue with gems and properties can be undone and reconfigured. In short, you get to be every kind of badass the game allows. You can be God Wizard on the Sorcery scale, God Assassin on the Finess scale or God Warrior on the Might scale, or any combination in between. 

Therefore this is a fighting game. If you were expecting crackling good storytelling, wonderous voice acting, and anything resembling a sense of humor appropriate to the vaguely familiar worlds of Seelie Fae in the [Sidhe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aos_S%C3%AD "Aos Sí"), forget it. The job done is admirable to a fault, the fault being that in the end you don't really care about all the wonderous lore of the joint. You just want to get that 249 unit ice hammer and smash the shit out of those fat red one-eyed giants who belly bumped you. 

But there's also the Niskaru, in case you get cocky. These creatures are like a combination of speed, death and death and speed. If there are two of them, be on your toes. If there are two and their boss, you had better hope some idiot giants or other [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character "Non-player character") have walked into the battle space, or else you're going to be swilling cures and freezing the action every five seconds to pick another combination of weapons, poisons, distractions and prayers.  Beware the crossroads of Southern Klurikon. You have been warned. 

No I haven't finished, but I expect more of the same in Alabastra, the final kingdom.

### [Searching the Universe for Vile Rats](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2012/09/searching-the-universe-for-vile-rats.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e2017ee3ce966d970d-pi)I read somewhere the other day that EVE Online is a thinking man's video game. Maybe it's just another level of sophistication in pursuit of making things go BOOM, or taking fragging to space. Either way, I'm intrigued. It shows every indication of being ridiculously complex. 

My Macbook seems to be for crap when it comes to 'PC gaming'. I thought I would give MMO gaming a chance, having pretty much done everything there is to do on my XBox. And so I took half the weekend to install and run EVE Online. You may recall that one of the staffers in Libya who suffered at the hands of radical islamists went by the handle of 'VileRat' in that universe. Well, if that's the kind of grownup I might meet in the MMO world, I'm all for it. As some of my readers know, my gaming has taken a nosedive since the death two of my best friends online. I understand and sympathize totally with those who have felt the loss. But my machine was no help. Once I downloaded the six GB it was a real clunker in the Barbie section, so I pretty much gave up. 

But the other night, having a bit of insomnia and free time allowed me to consider downgrading my video quality. It turns out that pretty much every problem had to do with the Barbie screen and the game runs fine. So I've created a couple of characters and joined a corporation and am off to do what's called PVP with my gang. 

--

On further review, I have found it nearly impossible to get over the psychological barrier of playing games on the same machine I use to do my daily work, and my writing. It's just too much time in one place. Unless and until I can get this deal working on my big screen with an XBox controller, I'm just not going to do it. Mouses are for work, all intrigue of vile rats notwithstanding.

### [Forward Unto Dawn: The Halo Movie](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2012/07/forward-unto-dawn-the-halo-movie.html)

The difference between a video game and a feature film is immersion. Video games with cinematics and excellent mattes and backgrounds approach the scale and grandeur of film - well, not really. What film does excellently is almost a cliche but it puts your characters in a super dramatic backdrop that expands the emotions conveyed by the actor. I think of Audrey Hepburn in the empty luxurious apartment in Charade.  I think of zooming into the car chase from the aerial shots of John Frankenheimer in Ronin. To get immersion, where it's your own emotions experiencing the narrative AND scenic drama is a holy grail which has not yet been found. Yet the days are approaching when the narrative drama of video game immersion and scenic drama of film are used in tandem in order to portray a universal story. By universal, of course I mean epic scale drama with key cores of protagonists taking their audience through multiple stories over the course of years. Halo is, of course, one such universe. This is the future of fiction. It is the medium for our children.

ViHart is one of the people to whom I subscribe. I like the way she thinks. I know the way she thinks because [she understands the new media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm-Jjvqu3U4&list=UUOGeU-1Fig3rrDjhm9Zs_wg&index=1&feature=plcp). Like hiphop, her youtubery incorporates its metadata into its content.  She reflects the wisdom, newly discovered by me, of Edmund Snow Carpenter who says:

> If you address yourself to an audience, you accept at the outset the basic premises that unite the audience. You put on the audience, repeating cliches familiar to it. But artists don't address themselves to audiences; they create audiences. The artist talks to himself out loud. If what he has to say is significant, others hear & are affected. 

Brilliant. 

So 343 is making, at long last, the Halo movie. Their aim is to complement the Halo universe with the kind of live action drama that cannot be accomplished in video games. They continue the very grabbing human drama in the live action shorts that preceded [Halo Reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo%3A_Reach "Halo: Reach"). I especially liked this one:.

What will come into being is the next installment of the video game franchise, continuing drama in the Halo universe accompanied by that thing the movie studios could not manage to accomplish, making a Halo movie. As much as I admired the sneak previews of the movie that was proposed several years ago, I now see that the new digital series: Forward Unto Dawn, will be more suited to those of us who have heard & been affected by what the artists of Halo have already said. It will put faces, in particular, into focus.

Every one of these external forays into media other than the game itself has been, in my view, a success. I still have vivid memories of the serialized audiobook of I Love Bees, which came out in between the original Halo and Halo 2.

The preview trailer of Forward Undo Dawn, just released over the weekend, has already had over 2 million views. The Halo Movie is already a success.

### [Paralympic Buzzkill](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2012/07/paralympic-buzzkill.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e201774356a09b970d-pi)

The only thing I want to see are Paralympic bloopers. I want to see a Paralympic fail reel. The agony of defeat for people with no feet. 

These days I am making friends with my libertarian sentiments. The reasons are manifold but I won't get into them right now. Understand, however, that the motivations for this idea come from that liberartian network of neurons in my political brain. 

I've been watching the Tour de France this week, and it is a stunning testament to the, dare I say it, triumph of the will. I've always considered it the world's most competitive sport, in which hundreds of men race through a fortnight of greuling trials and many hundreds of miles only to be separated by mere seconds at the finish.

Having been a mediocre cyclist, I have been there. In my 20s I possessed almost precisely the kind of ideal body for cycling. 5 foot 10. 167 pounds. Genetically big calves, great lungs and idiotically steely determination. Socially I thought the idea of cycling 100 miles with a bunch of cyclists to be ridiculous. So I stayed mediocre. But I got close enough to the sport to understand both its appeal and its challenges. The challenge is to push your body to the very limit of its endurance, to get on the bike and stay on it, to pace yourself and then punish yourself, pace and then punish again - to the point at which you can begin to hate yourself for eating a small banana instead of a large one. And.. well, that's the appeal too. Being a cyclist changes how you look at people's bodies.

If you actually believe in the greatness of the human spirit and you have an idea of what people are capable of, you cannot fail to be impressed by what the world's greatest atheletes do. Well, except for swimming. Swimming is catatonically boring. The only good thing about swimming is that it enables surfing, because surfing is awesome. But sports are changing as the human body is changing and progressively getting healthier and our ability with machines are changing. That's why we have the X Games. We are missing what great swordsmen were like. We are missing the athleticism of the ancient warrior, but we are gaining the athleticism of the motocrosser, the BMX stunter, the wakeboard aerialist. In our lifetimes, the improvement of women's gymnastics has been stunning. I expect to see a double back summersault on the balance beam in my life, which in the 70s was the most difficult trick in floor exercises.

We are often told however, that there is some extra measure of courage demonstrated by athletes with missing body parts. I don't buy it. A man who has half a right leg who runs a marathon on a fitted spring cannot possibly be facing greater fear or danger in his event that that which caused his crippling. 

What impresses me when I watch videos like those of [Andrew Dickey](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=andrew%20dickey&oq=&gs_l=&pbx=1&fp=fbbdc664aff417f8&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1644&bih=885) is the implicit knowledge that there are great failures to match every triumph. You fail more often trying front double pikes from the 1 meter springboard in practice than you score on the dives at a meet. You look at that hill and you shift down into the girly gears more often than you stand up and keep up the bike's momentum. I'm sure Dickey has more scars than a few, just like Travis Pastrana has broken so many bones that he approaches Evel Kneivel. I confess that I'm more impressed by people who wreck perfectly healthy bodies in search of sports perfection than those who start with wrecked bodies in search of sports mediocrity.  It's the old saw about excellence vs achievement.

Getting my grandmother to stop smoking was an achievment. Keeping ex-felons obeying the law is an achievement. Two year olds tying their own shoes is a remarkable achievement. I think the guy who plays Mortal Kombat with his face, because he has no thumbs, is a real champion, not that anybody much cares about Mortal Kombat. I mean what happens if you fail beyond embarrassment? What I want to see is the fat kid stand up after crashing through the fourth hurdle in the 110 meter event. That's remarkable. What I want to see is the anorexic shotputter dislocate her shoulder. What I want to see is the one-legged skateboarder bail on the rail. Wheelchair basketball? No. Goalball? No. Boccia? No. I want to see blood and guts.

I know that we are in evolutionary times when it comes to sport. I also know that a lot of the sports we have evolved to popularity are often [not athletic in the least](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/sportSkills), some border on the merest of cognitive pursuits. So we have time and bandwidth for a lot more events. I think the man who gets up on a bucking bull is courageous and the one-armed man who does the same thing is slightly more. Because we know the bull mostly wins. 

So. Show me the slo-mo fails. That's what I want to see. Real Drama.

### [Gaming Update](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2012/06/gaming-update.html)

It has been a while since I've done much gaming, but now that I'm a bit more secure and deeper into my new discipline, I'm creeping back. 

I am certainly a snob when it comes to the games I care about, and they are reduced to a fewer few. Even given all of the new stuff announced at E3 for this year, all I need for the next year, I already know.

**Old Dogs**  
First and foremost, let me make one crack about three people including myself. Thin ice. The other two are [Adam Sessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sessler "Adam Sessler") and [Peter Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Windsor "Peter Windsor"). Windsor, who was as far as I knew in my introduction to F1, the premeir gadfly when it came to wrangling soundbites from pit row just before the race. His attempt to start an F1 racing team flubbed and now he seems to be behind the mic again, but way off the broader mainstream - which aint particularly broad here in the states. Will Buxton, that young whippersnapper has taken over at Speed. And similarly, Blair Herter has pushed old Adam Sessler aside in an unfortunate succession. Did I sense that one coming? Hmm. Well, the other crap on G4 TV is crap and Herter has seemed to ditch his ambiguously gay asides as he stepped up. He still seems genuinely more happy (especially when it comes to Batman) about games and gamers, then did Sessler and the new stage and new vibe is established. Morgan Webb is, by the way, irreplacable. She is the perfect straight man, which is probably going to become more evident. The change may actually be welcome in retrospect because it's obvious that the n-year running joke about wierdness behind the curtain of X-Play is running thin, ALTHOUGH, the parody of getting the Skyrim sword was the best ever. And so where will Sessler land? Windsor, I don't care. Sessler should organize the best gaming podcasters and replace the young snarkers. Gaming crit is damned difficult, and Sessler is literate and deeply experienced. Nobody else comes close - even the MMO Report should be dropped and let Herter and Webb get shiny on the air, with the occasional faces that were at E3. 

So there it is, Sessler should ratchet up to Machinima / Satellite Radio quality, his own 90 minute weekly podcast with a new partner or three. That would be the only force to be recognized. If he shows up on another TV channel, I won't watch. Speaking of which, it is only through a podcast that Sessler can let his snark through in which he gives a more righteous savaging of what has recently been hinted as 'brutally honest' reviews on XPlay. As soon as he said 'brutally honest' we knew the game was going to be shite, but he still has to smile for the camera. No more. Go PG-13 Adam. Hell, go R. Now's the chance.

**Watch_Dogs**  
The unqualified hit of E3 was Watch_Dogs. Once it happens, we will wonder how we lived without that style of gaming for so long. I wondered all along. I mean I didn't want to do LA Noir, and I got nice and bored with Alan Wake's flashlight after a dozen hours. I like an urban sandbox where I have badass powers, but not necessarily strictly destruction. While it's very difficult for me to choose between Mercenaries 2 and Saints Row the Third where that was concerned, the more realistic games were more problematic. GTA Four, for example. It did the narrative perfectly and gave me a character I liked to be, but... Stealing cars and shooting people and running from cops, it's so tired. Somebody give me a sword or some other weapon. Which reminds me, the *next* Assassin's Creed will be the best one - when Ezio is in today's time, and then next when he's in the future. But Watch_Dogs is going to be the first one to do this super nice with cyber powers of the sort we kind of expected from Splinter Cell Double Agent, but more nicely got from Conviction ..yet.. downloading all that cyberbadness to a man in the field is badass. Can't wait.

**Future Soldier**  
The best thing about GRFS is that there is a cover system and you can go indoors. Basically that was the difference between Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon. Ghost Recon could only do outdoor battles, covering large distances in big maps, which made more sense finally when vehicles were added. Rainbow Six added the cover system and made a giant leap forward in setting up marking targets and blasting doors. My preference went to R6 for the close quarters and multiplayer - loved blowing up those slot machines and the control was marvelous. Meanwhile Gears was owning the outdoors (no matter what MW folks said). Speaking of which, I have to say that Battlefield 3 has really become the game that I want to play instead of Modern Warfare.

Call of Duty was best, best, best, when there were huge 16 on 16 battles with WW2 weapons and people used mics. Something went wrong and now the battles seem cartoony without being a fun as Halo. The objective battles on Future Soldier are the right combination with the sprinting and cover system as good as Gears (better in some respects) and the necessity for teamwork and using mics. Anyway I think I'll stick with Battlefield 3 DLC and Future Soldier. Yes I'll have to play the new MW Black Ops 2, but...

**Forza Horizon**  
Forza realizes that racing games are social? Well duh. I can't tell you how well it may actually work, but I kinda like the idea that there might be car clubs rolling in that game.  That will make it a winner - the idea will be inevitable and I think it's going to work. You can't beat Forza control, and although I still prefer Codemasters Grid for damage and realism, Forza is just as perfect. Yes I'd try one more Project Gotham, but what we need for all of these is Next Gen stuff - especially for the Clancy brand.

**Next Gen**  
So let me say what I want to see for Next Gen, now that XBox 720 rumors are all out.

1. I don't give a crap about 3D, and neither should anybody. I won't pay extra for it at home. It's crap - just like those 5.1 systems they were selling 8 years ago.

2. The XBox controller is one of the greatest UI inventions ever. They should Arduino the hell out of it. If it wasn't Microsoft, that would already be a $50 million business. 

3. Multi-voice recognition is more important than multi-gesture recognition. That should be the focus of Kinect tech. Siri will know this and it will be a big differentiator. 

4. Everything depends on three things. XBox, Playstation, AppleTV. I cannot imagine that Nintendo does any settop integration - and too bad, but. they want to play with kids. Fine. 

5. Microsoft cannot brand streaming content. Forget about it and just be a platform. Metro suffices. Netflix was a huge win. Now get Time Warner and MGM and those guys before it's too late. Speaking of which..

Whomever partners with Amazon in the living room wins. This is so bloody obvious. If Amazon makes a set-top the market is going to stay interesting and volatile for another five years. So even though Apple could own music and movies, they are nowhere near getting sophisticated PC and console gamers. So yes, there is yet another chance for a Netflix/Amazon/Tivo entry into the market where Roku and Vudu are still minor players. This is the future, not MSNBC.

Hell, even Marvel and Ubisoft have a shot. Who is going to learn first from cinematics and the Next Gen console on how to make more mergey content gamey-movies? OK that's all.

### [ME3: Ended](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2012/04/me3-ended.html)

Before I read the spoilers, I want to put down my thoughts about the ending of Mass Effect 3. I heard that there was a great deal of consternation and dissatisfaction with the ending of the game. People were saying that it didn't matter what they did at a certain point, they would get to the same ending - which was inevitable. 

I disagree that the ending was bad, and I discount the complaint that any sort of behavior in the game made not enough difference.

It was when I finally battled the Ninja dude at the Illusive Man's headquarters that I realized that I had taken the step that pushed me over the edge of the story into the concluding parts. It was just before I did so that I decided to be a complete renegade. I felt that after the fall of the Asari homeworld that there was no reason to be anything but survivalist. After all, the Asari were pretty badass. So from that moment on, I started to get tingly about what might happen next that would sour so many gamers on the conclusion to ME3.

It finally seemed to me that in London there might be one more boss battle against the main Reaper whose defeat would make the rest run away, or that suddenly that defeat rallied Earth troops. But it wasn't that bad ending. Then it seemed to me that the Crucible would destroy Earth as well as all of the machines in the galaxy, something like the dreaded Halo firing. No it didn't go pear shaped that way. Then, as I approached the beam in London, I thought maybe Shepard would die and the story would have no resolution - naah. Couldn't be that, but it came close.

The end that happened was good enough, but also confusing enough not to have been supported by the ledgends and dialog in the playing of the game. In other words, it kept me guessing, and now gives me time after the end to consider whether or not it sits well with me. Let me immediately contrast that with Skyrim.

In Skyrim, all you have is the fate of Skyrim, relatively speaking. There was no do or die situation - and so its main quest could be completed and you could still have things to do. This was not the case for ME3. And in that way there was but a singular destiny for Shepard, the consequences of which changed everything. The Reapers were so overwhelmingly successful that their conquest was part of a cycle, and this cycle had to continue or the galaxy would be transformed.  This was the revelation that was flubbed with the Illusive Man and finally given to the Catalyst-Child, and yeah that was kind of awkward if logical. But it all ended up with Shepard shutting down the Reapers via the Crucible because that was the only way Shepard lives to the conclusion - a conclusion which he couldn't live past. 

I think it's safe to presume that the Normandy landed on some planet other than Earth. It could have been made a bit more clear that the Crucible forced the Reapers to flee the Earth and then chased them down with a secondary blast of some sort and it was this secondary blast that blew the Normandy out of the sky. But that's a minor dig. The point was that it laneded in the next Eden in a galaxy with no mass effect relays.

Now that I think about it, this is rather like the ending of Fire Upon the Deep, which I finished a couple weeks ago.

Anyway, there's no DLC and the Mass Effect galaxy is dead, which for all the advanced fighting controls, got a little tiresome by the time I got to London. On the whole, the game held up well, and allowed me to get through it without being bogged down by tiresome intrigues and side-missions unrelated to the big picture. I can't tell you how annoying it used to be finding planets and buying probes and looting eezo just so I could fix something on the Normandy or amp up a pistol. I liked the characters better in ME2 and solving their problems was more interesting than listening to Anderson and Hackett jabber on. But that drove the plot that had to be driven.

In conclusion, it did really have to end this way, and because it did and because Shepard had to live to the end, the inevitability of shutting down the galaxy had to happen. Interestingly enough, I think it makes the Geth and the Quarians the new rulers of the Galaxy, as they are more accustomed to living in far flung spaces without contact to the Council.

Sobeit.

### [Skyrim Personality Profiles](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2011/12/skyrim-personality-profiles.html)

[](https://cobb.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515ae969e20168e4af1fda970c-pi)Watching your kids play RPGs can give an interesting insight into their personalities, or at least their gaming personalities. I've noticed differences in our styles in Skyrim.

Sprite, who just turned 15 is a sneaky miser. She will not leave any piece of gold anywhere, no matter how much she has piled up. She is a level 14 Imperial and has just joined the Dark Brotherhood. She prefers using ranged weapons and will aim her bow forever before she releases the arrow. She has gone online to figure out every recipe for Alchemy. She tends to walk around with a lot of cash. She asks me all kinds of questions before she makes a move and has not ventured anywhere without knowing what's there first. She saves constantly and will not take any risk that she cannot undo and retry. Yes she's in the Theives Guild. She goes nowhere without Lydia, the Whiterun Housecarl, and generally does not fast travel. She almost never uses her shouts, and keeps lots of food on her.

Scholar, who is 16, is a paragon. She will not consort with daedra and gets mad at me when I do. She too is an Imperial and has joined the Legion. She has decided that Solitude is the best city and is saving 25000 in order to buy a house there. She is fine with the assassinations of the Dark Brotherhood and was the first one of us to join (she chose to kill the bad soldier). She prefers riding a horse to fast travel. When it comes to battle, she is all about heavy armor and two handed weapons. Just get it done. She's a clobberer. She prefers the miscellaneous quests and finds all kinds of interesting things to do. She has got shouts that none of us have heard of, like Kyne's Voice or something like that.

Boy is 17 and a gamer's gamer. So he games the game. He plays it like Modern Warfare - kill the enemy and move on. For him it's all about speed and progress. He's a High Elf and has a devastating One Arm. He has already taken over the Theive's Guild and claims to have a tremendous amount of money. He appropriately does not tell us his cheats, but has already found an (the?) Elder Scroll. He has no problems handling the machines in the Dwarven Ruins even though he's only Level 27. He is a Werewolf and loves beast mode, although I haven't seen him do it. He gathers every sprig and leave in Skyrim and keeps about 60 different potions on him at all times, never selling any of them. I think he's only doing the main quest, or quests he's found online that provide maximum rewards.

I'm a Level 34 Redguard specializing in Archery and Conjuration. I explore everywhere and do everything all at once. I'm the most likely to meet somebody in a town and already have the item the fulfills their quest. I spent 40 days as a vampire and hated it, coming to an insane conclusion which is a story in itself. I am mostly enjoying the metagame, considering what improvements have been made since Oblivion and am most impressed with the extent to which events between factions are more well thought out and consequential to the arc of the story. I'm in the Dark Brotherhood and intend to take it over. Almost never travel without a follower and I instantly conjure a dremora and an atronach when I meet a big enemy. I'm in the Blades and have brought three followers, and very much enjoy hunting dragons with the whole crew.

### [Living In The Fourth Era](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2011/12/living-in-the-fourth-era.html)

The last time I was in New York I asked myself some of the same questions I always do in the world's wealthiest and most powerful city. One of the answers was exactly the same - which is that I would still want a penthouse in the Beresford Building and I would still want to buy the Russian Tea Room and have it be the greatest jazz club in the world. If I had the money. There was a new answer which begged a question about the arts in Western Civilization, and the answer was on Madison and Park Avenues. We still make some of the best crafts ever. Say what you like about the "1%", when we are all dead and recycled, they will dig up Tiffany's with awe. There actually is something extraordinary about the best clothes and furnishings money can buy. We human beings still know how to make beautiful things, and they are still all around us.

It's hard to remember that when you listen to popular music and wonder at why nobody has taken the place of Stravinsky or Ellington. It's hard to remember when you see what is done with the most extravagant and expensive motion picture technology. The beauty is lost somewhere in the piles of money and technocrap, if it was ever considered. More and more television and film is done by cartoon, cartoon arts for cartoon minds. It's hard to remember that we know how to make beautiful, inspiring creations in media.

In today's headlines, there is a company called Carrier IQ that is being paid by AT&T, Sprint and just about everybody else to have a little bit of spyware in every smartphone. There's probably a not-so-sinister reason behind it. After all, if nobody knows where your cellphone is but you and the closest tower, it's probably not enough, and don't we whine about dropped calls? It's easy to consider, as an IT professional, the marvels of what we have done. The geek fascination is certainly arresting, but there's nothing beautiful or inspiring about that. So I have to think, given a little time, about what is the greatest and most life altering consequence of all of the digital technology we've built over the past three decades. What has Moore's Law really delivered? Any art?

Yes. Although it's easy to forget that all tools should serve higher human purposes, there ought to be truth and beauty. There ought to be art. But if you look around, most people have forgotten all about that. Say what you will about Facebook. Say what you will about Amazon, Yahoo, Microsoft, IBM, AT&T, Sprint, Intel, Cisco, Dell, HP, Google and all of their greatest accomplishments. They have not created art - if they ever knew how, they have forgotten.

Fortunately, the people at Bethesda Softworks have not forgotten. Ever.  

Yes, now you know that finally this is about the Elder Scrolls. It is about Skyrim. It is about a continuing story, a never ending one, the story of the struggles of man for peace and war and ambition and shame and adventure and all that comes about when times change. 

You should be marking these years. There are millions of people making billions of 140 character phrases in a digital deluge of meaninglessness. They are lightyears away from approaching the million year million monkey Shakespeare contest, but Bethesda will be remembered. They are masters of their craft and we are now seeing what that craft can be. It is the new literature, and it is capable of being as profound as any opera, as any stage play. We only have to recognize.

I cannot say what edification can come from the fantastic quests with dungeons and dragons, good and evil gods and men. That is not the question to ask. What edification can come from living in a house by Frank Lloyd Wright, from wearing the finest Savile Row suit? There is something transcendent about the perfection of craft that reminds us of our fundamental creative powers. It is not that listening to Glenn Gould playing the Goldberg Variations tells us something didactic, but merely that you witness the mastery. It is the opportunity to experience the genius in operation first hand. That is what it is like to live inside the world of Bethesda's creation. 

Bethseda is not alone in this arts and crafts movement. There are other great video game makers, people who craft the music, the animations, the voice craft, the logic, the feel, the stories of all sorts. But the most immersive, the ones that have the greatest opportunity to leave marks on us as experiences are the roleplay games, and in that genre Bethesda rules. 

We are living in the era when the greatest video games ever are being built. Recognize.

### [MW3:WW3 - Commandos on Wall Street](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2011/11/mw3ww3.html)

This fall is one of the most extaordinary gaming seasons in memory, if not ever. The lineup of blockbuster games is superp.

There has been:

Rage, Forza 4, Gears of War 3, Battlefield 3, Dead Island and the upcoming Skyrim and Halo Anniversary Edition. I'll talk about how impressed I am with Gears later. But the most anticipated game since Halo Reach is now in my hot little mitts. It's all about WW3. 

I didn't expect that WW3 would have already started. We've already seen the previews. Check out this. 

I guess that's all I've got to say. How does it get better than doing commando duty on Wall Street? Just you wait until Chapter Two. This is the most astonishing action I've seen. More later...

### [Chris Crawford: Efficiency vs Effectiveness](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2011/08/chris-crawford-efficiency-vs-effectiveness.html)

Listening to the entirety of Crawford's Dragon Speech is truly going back in time to the very verge of the computer revolution. He is just about two years my senior in terms of the sort of intro the both of us got into computing, and demonstrates exactly the sort of personality that dominated the thinking about the future of what has become the computing universe.

"That is the basic problem that we face. The expository lecture is efficient."

When I listen to Crawford, especially as he speaks about Alan Kay, I am really kind of shocked into self-recognition at the kind of approach we took in thinking about how computing could change society. I think of Crawford as rather oblivious to the market, and in comparison, the current generation is obsessed with the market. 

This is something of another opportunity for me to suggest that today's social software tends to be democratizing in a simplistic and rather shallow way. We are finding hundreds of ways to get 17 cents worth of attention from tens of millions, rather than 1700 dollars worth of respect from hundreds of thousands. Which will advance us? How much effectiveness will we get out of the kind of interactivity that is become the defacto market standard on the web? I think part of the answer is how little traffic Crawford's website has garnered. 

At the very least, somebody ought to transcribe the Dragon Speech. It is an excellent marker in history. Crawford was thinking what we were all thinking. Now that we have the technology, Bioware is the closest to what Crawford dreamed. As great as Mass Effect is, is that the story we have always really wanted to tell?

### [Cow Clicker](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2011/08/cow-clicker.html)

It has been over a year since I last played Mafia Wars. I collected billions of stuff, and I think it has one truly great educational aspect. As you collect millions of dollars a day, you recognize how big a trillion dollars truly is. Aside from that, I follow Ian Bogost to keep my head straight about what is and is not a waste of braincells with regard to gaming. 

His [Cow Clicker](http://www.bogost.com/blog/cow_clicker_1.shtml) is a classic meme. Know it.

### [Cranky Over Gay Games](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2011/03/cranky-over-gay-games.html)

I get emails from the editors of The Root, a singular publication sponsored by Skip Gates, that continues and extends crackpot racial conspiracy theories for those who dig them. It's only rarely that I find anything that really interests me, but almost never enough to comment. Today, however, I've gotten forwarded a second missive on the same 'university study' about how the 'gaming community' is complicit in the assault against 'minorities'. I [excerpt](http://crasstalk.com/2011/03/the-gambit-project-and-the-gaming-communitys-minority-problem/).

> The GAMBIT study involved creating and registering gamer profiles with the names PROUD_2B_MUSLIM, GayPride90 and Black_N_Proud90, and playing _Halo: Reach_ online with random players (for those who don’t know, the use of hate speech in gaming is usually associated with the proliferation of console multi-player gaming via the original _Halo_). As you can probably guess, the players using those names suffered much verbal abuse directed towards the identities their names indicated they had. Not only that, in player vs. player combat those with the minority-identified names were more aggressively targeted.
> 
> Good’s analysis of this study is, to my mind at least, indicative of the ossified privilege that is endemic to gaming as an industry explicitly designed to serve the sensibilities of disgruntled white teenage boys. Good looks at the hate speech and aggressive play and concludes that the minority-identified players brought the abuse upon themselves. Good writes – “If you’re looking to be called the usual filth-flarn-flarn-filth-flarn, those are some awesome gamertags, well worth the 800 Microsoft Points change fees.”
> 
> Good’s insinuation, as per his title, is that GAMBIT is involved in “intellectualized trolling” here, but his use of the term “trolling” is both disingenuous and fundamentally incorrect. Trolling, as those who have spent even a small amount of time on internet message boards will tell you, is a sort of forum sport in which a member posts something for the sole purpose of causing arguments and strife within the topic or thread. By definition, trolling is provocation – it is done solely to elicit emotion and negative response.
> 
> Thus, what Good is really implying is that being a Muslim, or black, or a woman, or a gay person, and being open about that fact to others, is _an open provocation_ in the gay community, that being a minority player is something that you _inflict_ on other people. There’s no real scandal in being called a nigger or a fag or a cunt in a game, or being singled out for aggression based on your identity – it wouldn’t have happened had you kept it to yourself. The onus is on the abused to prevent abuse. This is, obviously, a repugnant view to hold to, but it’s one that seems to be held as widely agreeable within the gaming community.

Obviously there's some subtlety involved in determining who's writing a review of a review of a study about what gamers say and think and the reasons they do so. Which is why, after a couple glasses of Jack Daniels, it was so easy for me to get some gut rumbles about the foolishness of the entire matter. I responded like Redd Foxx.. to wit.

> All this reminds me of loud minority talk of the 70s after there was nothing left to burn after 68. At some point it continues on its own momentum driven not by substance but by the curiosity of people who really actually don't give a shit, and the fanaticism of people who do. It becomes a trope which actually challenges nobody because it's always priced out of the reasonableness of the discussion. 
> 
> One day somebody is going to make a gay game character that's as popular as the Master Chief, just like we might have said in 1974, one day a black man is going to win the Oscar for best actor. The problem is that in 1974 the black actors getting consideration were simply not in a position through a combination of skill and connection to win that prize, and so everybody suffered loud minority guff amongst films like Blackula and Super Fly TNT. And that is about the status of gay gaming right now. No amount of ranting and raving and critical theory, scholarly melioration or minority hermaneutics of any degree is going to create that great gay game. It's going to take the Denzel who was born to do it. And today that game programmer doesn't exist, or he's just batting in the bush leagues. So what. 
> 
> I imagine that it's difficult for people with iphones who can complain about having a dropped call (!) to try to imagine how millions of people survived before the advent of the boombox - how anybody could possibly appreciate monaural music collections consisting of fewer than 100 albums - how could we possibly find music to fall in love, get married and make babies to, and in that order. And with no black actors taking home the gold statue, how might we have found any self-respect? It comes as no surprise that such people, clueless as to what it might be like to face mandatory conscription, could lose sleep over being called an EPITHET by some anonymous teenager in a virtual game room. Such things are considered significant by this generation. It's weakness, I tell you. It's weakness because 55 year old men who have no compunction for giving you an actual illegal ass-kicking *say* it's weakness. Think of that the next time you say 'Kadafi'. You share this planet with true, honest to goodness badasses who do drink, smoke, curse, spit, cheat, and fight dirty. Love *that* neighbor, ya yellow whelp. 
> 
> One of these days, when you prissy little pricks get through a divorce, a heart attack, a child custody battle, an irs audit, a felony conviction, a civil suit, a foreclosure or a something more serious than a teabagging in Call of Duty, please write us another 1000 words about how much we need virtual alternate role models. 
> 
> Or fucking write the game yourself.

It makes no sense, of course, for today's gay gaming community - whatever that is, to emulate the black community of the 70s -whatever that was.  Nor does it really make any sense to dignify those 'communities' until such time as they manage to overthrow a dictator and convince the international community - whatever that is, to lob some cruise missiles in their favor.  

Habeas Corpus.

### [The Ten Great Video Games That Changed Everything](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2011/01/the-ten-great-video-games-that-changed-everything.html)

1. PacMan

2. Myst

3. Doom

4. Halo

5. Grand Theft Auto

6. Tetris

7. Warcraft

8. Virtua Fighter

9. Donkey Kong

10. Second Life

--

None of these are the best and they have all been superceded in what they can do, but each was a game changer in their own way. They each had a twist to them that changed the way people thought about video games and gaming. 

Obviously PacMan started this off. It was the beginning of the end of the domination of pinball machines and the first compelling videogame that intrigued a generation. There were other games in that era that were more innovative after the fact of PacMan. The great arcade games of the day, Asteroids, Defender, Atari Football, Zaxxon, Missile Command, Galaxians and Centipede were all the greats. But PacMan was the one that showed it could be done, that video oriented electronic games could beat pinball. But it was Donkey Kong that pushed the obsession to the next level and made Nintendo the King. There was no other game that sucked down so many quarters and hours after PacMan and brought a new generation into the arcades.

It took decades, really, for pinball to give up the ghost. And it probably wasn't until the early and mid 90s with the rise of the fighting games that arcades all over America realized that the money was all about the video. Virtua Fighter was the game that took button mashing to a new era. Now I am showing my bias because Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Kombat were the other kings of the arcade in the days when The Fugees were singing 'Mona Lisa', but the sophistication of Virtua Fighter was the game that put a third dimension into arcade fighting.

On the techie level I'd be remiss to not give honorable mention to Castle Wolfenstein but it was Doom that changed gaming on the PC and got people shooting at work. Well, if you were in the computer business. Which takes us back to Tetris, a simple, beautifully obsessive game that showed us that.. well I don't know what it showed us. How easily we could be seduced by a simulation of gravity? 

Warcraft I just threw in there because I know it's big, but I never touched the thing. Most PC games, in their early incarnations just made me dizzy and gave me headaches. In fact, just watching a video of Doom makes me feel ill. It's why I stayed in the arcades and never gave much time over to PC gaming until, Myst.

This list and idea exists because of Myst, which I think more than just about any other game, completely blew away all the competition and made everybody aware of how fantastically beautiful, musically engulfing and intellectually challenging a video game could be. Myst was the siren call of the future and we knew finally that we were in a new era. Pong and PacMan were invented to keep us all seeding the market with money so that Myst could be born. Myst, single-handedly created immersion.

Grand Theft Auto was the sandbox game that proved that virtual gaming could be purposeless and sometimes it was better just to do nothing but be bad. It shifted the mind. I didn't arrive at the series until Vice City which was nowhere near as good as San Andreas, where it all got perfected, but it was GTA that made the sandbox real.

Halo made the XBox. It also marked the beginning of a universe that actually bore some reality to mature science fiction. Second Life was immersion part two. And that's about all I have to say about that.

Mario. Zelda. Tomb Raider. Final Fantasy? All kiddie garbage. I'd put the Sims in there before any of that stuff which I think is all at the level of Super Monkeyball and Sonic the Hedgehog. 

Madden. Half Life. Metal Gear. Resident Evil. All honorable mention, but then I'd have to talk about Starcraft and Sin and Black & White and Civilization and whole bunch of other very good, even excellent franchises. But they didn't change the world. They just gave it flavor, and bottom line they dont make the top ten. I gave you Warcraft so get off me.

Now in the modern era of gaming, which basically means the current dominating consoles PS3, XBox360 and gaming boxes, I have some choice choices. But that's for another day.

### [Ebert vs Gamers](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2010/10/ebert-vs-gamers.html)

Here is a comment I wrote that's too big to fit over at [NewSavanna](https://new-savanna.blogspot.com/2010/10/ebert-defends-literature-on-uncharted.html). Check it out.

> You may have heard that Ebert’s been kicking up a fuss about video games. He doesn’t think that they can ever be art. This little tempest in a teapot led him to Tweet and then blog a simple question: “Which of these would you value more? A great video game. _Huckleberry Finn_, by Mark Twain.” The answer came back 13,823 to 8,088 in favor of video games.
> 
> And so Ebert [posted that result to his blog](http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/video_games_13823_huck_finn_80.html), while also admitting that there was nothing remotely scientific about his procedure. It’s just an informal question, with an answer that didn’t please him. And he launches into a defense and justification of literature without, however, saying anything more against video games. For the moment, that’s done and gone.

Right now there are legions of video games that allow you to walk in the shoes of characters with different backgrounds. The best of these provide and extraordinary experience. None so legendarily riveting as one of the early Call of Duty series that put you on Omaha Beach. It was, in just about every way, equal to the cinematic experience of Spielberg's opening to Saving Private Ryan, except that your character dies. You die over and over again from acts of violence whose origin you are incapable of determining. There is no strategy or tactic you can use to think your way up the beach. You simply die 10 or 12 times, and then by sheer luck you live and continue the game.

There are few ways to express the horror of war that are more impressive than that. You get your orders, you have your rifle, you move forward through chaos expecting to win, and you lose. Over and over again, you lose. You contribute a pile of bodies to the gory landscape as you recognize that there actually can be no war narrative as subtle and compelling as your game experience. Nobody survives it.

The power of historical simulations in the narrative form of Call of Duty may be instructive, depending on the intent of the authors, but nothing is quite as immersive as those 'period pieces' we refer to as sandbox RPGs.

An RPG is a role-playing game. You inhabit a character which is either a pre-selected individual whose skills you can modify slightly through gained experience, or whose appearance and characteristics you can modify greatly. A sandbox game in one in which you are given a very large area in which to play - a realm as it were, and whose specific narrative is addressed at your leisure.

In a game like Call of Duty, you are assigned missions and you work with your squadmates (either real people online, or AIs) to accomplish them. There is nothing else to do and you must walk a narrow path. For example, you are walking through a shallow river in a jungle on a Pacific Island - your mission is to destroy a Japanese weapons depot. Enemies snipe at you in the river canyon. All you can do is evade them, shoot back and get to the ammo dump alive, then blow it up. Mission accomplished. Next mission.

In a sandbox game, you are in a wide open space, 1945 Brooklyn perhaps, and now home from the war you are to find a job in the mob. But you can stop and shop, talk to neighbors and waste as much time as you like interacting with people who are non-essential to the primary plot. These may be mini-missions, like find a cheating husband, or a missing child which only serve to shape your character independent of the primary mission. It is almost unanimous that the two greatest sandbox RPGs are Grand Theft Auto 4 and Red Dead Redemption. One set in contemporary NYC and the other on the border of Texas & Mexico circa 1900.

Games such as these challenge designers to create a verisimilitude that will engage gamers as long as a good book would. One generally expects to finish a straight mission based game like Call of Duty in under 10 hours. But a sandbox RPG like Mafia 2 or Fallout 3 contain easily 60 hours of immersion. To complete every main and side quest in such games can easily take double that amount of time. And recall that in most sandbox games, your actions change the character. So often gamers will play the entire game as a good person and then replay the entire game as an evil person.

The opportunity for critical evaluation of video games as literature is enormous. The difficulty is that the bulk of the industry is perceived callously by intellectuals, who are invariably not gamers. And because games are sophisticated, it's not easy to become one.

One commonly cited reason that games are dismissed is because of their violent content. It is reasonable to note that violence is part of the attraction of many many video games. But the same can be said of Western movies. A war simulation as a first person shooter is about as hacked a genre as cowboys and indians. But there are better and worse, and the proper role of the critic is to nudge the art along.

I think this will inevitably happen because the bandwidth for games is so broad. Unlike with hiphop, I think the lack of intellectual criticism will not hinder the aesthetic value of video games. They are much too expensive an enterprise and require too much collaborative creativity to continue on momentum alone. And quite frankly, outside the MSM, there is some serious gamer crit.

Even though he is employed by Microsoft, a cat named 'Major Nelson' sets a fairly high standard for commentary. The most widely know critics are G4TV's Adam Sessler and Morgan Web. They've been in the business for over a decade, and more and more often, in almost every one of their daily shows called X-Play they queue the phrase 'brutally honest review' for games you know are going to suck.

There are artists in the realm of video game design and production, and while blockbuster titles tend to make all the moola, there is an 'indie' spirit that is alive and well in the industry. But overall, the industry is just at that point where technology is beginning to matter less and less, and richer stories, characters and experiences are required. I don't think you'll find anyone who could dismiss the richness of the worlds created in games like Bioshock and Mass Effect 2. Is it art? If anyone could possibly consider Roger Corman an artist, then video games have been art for a long time. Is it fine art? It's getting close.

### [Halo Reach: Full Satisfying Circle](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2010/09/halo-reach-full-satisfying-circle.html)

Aha.

Halo Reach is a very fine conclusion to the Halo series. And I say that strictly based on the aha moment I had coming to the close of the campaign. The discovery of my player's identity as the Master Chief, the one chosen by Cortana, late in the game was just  magical. I said "I got it".

I have to say that makes Reach the most consistent and satisfying prequel I've ever played, watched, or read. History comes alive in the Halo universe on Reach. I say this having the benefit of one aspect of the Halo universe that goes very often without much fanfare, and that is the I Love Bees audio drama. Over the past couple weeks, the first previews of the final installment played. One of them was a live action trailer showing families on Reach the first day of the Covenant invasion - at the moment the battle began. It immediately drew me in emotionally to the idea of humanity threatened, and echoes of I Love Bees surfaced. That, my friends, is fine sci-fi.

Reach is the saddest installment. And while I'm sure it will end on a note of hope as the Pillar of Autumn escapes the doomed planet, there is nothing that quite has the emotional impact of fighting with a squad that gradually gets ground down to one. There is urgency in the arc of the story that is missing from most of the ODST. Only in a few parts of that mission were soldiers involved in protecting civilians. The most dramatic of these scenarios is actually in the Halo Wars RTS where the player is responsible for protecting evac ships. That theme is resumed, if only through cut scenes, in Halo Reach - and again, it adds an element of tragedy. Where ODST finds one wandering solo through a maze of confusion in New Mombasa, puzzling things out with plenty of time - the tragic urgency of Reach penetrates your gaming skull.

Reach has everything. It's hard to imagine how many features they packed into the game. When you compare it to the prior Halo games, it makes you think - wow, they sure have gotten better over the past 7 years. It also makes you appreciate how much compute power is packed into the XBox 360 as a platform, and how extraordinary it is to have the network capabilities it has. There are all sorts of vehicles, there are a huge number of different game types. There is a broad selection of skill loadouts that allow you to change tactics on every respawn. There are multiple cool ways to play co-op or competitively. There are custome games - and it all works well without any degradation or much change in the feel of the overall Halo playing style. It very much feels like Halo, even though I still want to melee with the B button.

Somewhat new to Halo is a lot more flying. From personal jet packs, to VTOLs to space fighters, there are many ways to engage aerial combat. The space fighting is inspired. Speaking of which, Reach has a gigantic moon. What's up with that thing?

Anyway, it's good that Halo is back. They grossed 200 million in the first week and there are half a million players online at any one time on average this week. Not bad.

### [The Lethal One Is Dead](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2010/06/the-lethal-one-is-dead.html)

I know his real name. I know his voice. I know what he would say. I know where he has been. And now that he is on his way to heaven, I don't want to go to his funeral. I know I'm being selfish, and I don't want to face the fact of his death. It wasn't that he seemed invincible, but you figured the old bastard would be around a lot longer. This is not a eulogy. This is just something I've got to say.

It hasn't been quite a year, I don't think, since the last of my online gamer buddies died. And now here we go again. It's breaking my heart, just breaking my heart.

His tag was 'Lethalme'. Three syllables, with the accent on 'me'. He was leader of the Cult of Sun Tzu, a scabbarous wag with a salty tongue and the conspiratorial honesty of old men. No. He wasn't our leader, he was our heart and soul and center of gravity. We loved him. We loved him like a crazy uncle, like a man too wise for words who never bothered to lecture us. I would call him by his name but I never met him in person. It doesn't feel right. We lived in dozens of virtual spaces communicating in real time, but I never shook his hand or bought him a drink.

I met him about six years ago in Moscow. We were driving our Ferraris in circles around Red Square and he was cursing out some kid. And the kid said how old are you? and you must be high. He said I'm old enough to be your grandfather and I'm smoking a bowl right now. Four months out of the year he smoked bowls of weed. We would notice the change in his attitude when he was off the stuff. I thought he just enjoyed it, and I liked his discipline. He'd go out to the garage and light up because it wasn't allowed in the house. I didn't know it was because of the cancer until years later.

One day, out of the blue, we talked about USC. He went there some time around the sixties when there weren't many black folks around. We talked about old black LA, for about 90 minutes. I can't remember a minute of it, but I could tell he was a man about town. He was a musician, and got a full ride on scholarship. I forget what he played, but I know he got himself a new guitar in the last days. It was the only picture I had of him. He was happy to be learning, and it was a good expensive guitar. He said it was easier than he expected.

There's a popular commercial about the Most Interesting Man in the World. The Lethal One was the most interesting man I ever knew. He was a real life hot rodder back in 50s Los Angeles and he ran with the street racers. He played golf with Mamie Clayton's family. He was a railroad engineer. He was an air traffic controller. He was the kind of man who lived by his wits when it was necessary. He didn't dwell on the past. He made his avatar a woman who looked like her name would be Mabel or Flo. He liked drivers and shooters. He liked us.

He lived on the eastern edge of the City of Angels on the western edge of the desert. Every night he would sit out in the garage and turn on the wheel. It wasn't easy to piss him off and he wasn't arbitrary, but suddenly somebody would be on his shit list and we'd never hear the end of it. That happened to TapDancer. That happened to Ferfer. That happened to Volvo. But Ferfer got back into the fold somehow. The Lethal One wasn't vengeful. 

Lethal liked me. He always spoke highly of me. He used to call me 'Six'. Said I was a good looking dude with a good looking family. He said I was pretty smart. I spent many weeks thinking about how I'd make my way out to the desert and cook up some steaks with him. Last year we all promised to get together at the Long Beach Grand Prix, but he had family in for the weekend and pulled out at the last minute. So that summer when I got tickets to Return to Forever, I tried to get him out. But he couldn't make it. I figured that I'd catch up to him sooner or later.

He was beyond discipline in the way that men who get away with it are. So I never heard him complain. Oh sure he had his moments when we talked politics and he was even into a conspiracy theory or two.  But he didn't try to get people to do what he wanted them to do - he would just tell you plainly.

You could go through two lifetimes and never meet one such as the Lethal One. He was one of those characters you'd expect Rudyard Kipling to write about. A man's man, a lover of people, a disciple of a few glorious callings and a rascal as constant and faithful. He had a beautiful charisma. He never lied. He never faked the funk. He never changed his accent. He might have done several things for no good reason but he was passionate like that. He explained himself, but didn't make excuses.

I never met him in person. I never will.

And there I am again, this gamer, this virtual presence with my virtual friends all so near and dear to my heart disappearing. I have a thousand mashed up memories from a thousand hours with The Lethal One and our friends. And I'm a loser. He's off the grid.

Ooooh baby! He would say. We'd be swinging around the last corner on the Washington DC circuit in AC Cobras and he'd be in 6th or 7th place. Kudos in jeopardy! Or we'd be at the first hairpin turn at the end of the downhill straight at Mugello and everybody would want to stay clear of his havoc. Or we'd be at the old neon sign graveyard outside of Vegas and he would play Dickstepper with the shotty. He used to stand outside the near door at the Presidio and toss grenades. That was always his entrance - predictable every time. He used to drive the Mouse Mini Cooper for the Red Team on the Ring. He used to love that stupid beach map on Island Thunder. And he always used to get caught in the hallways in The Vault or coming up the ladder from the basement tunnels at . We battled together at the train stations of Black Arrow, the casino rooftops in Vegas 2, the tank field at Modern Warfare, fighting Nazi zombies in a beat up old building with a sofa in the middle of a staircase and a hundred other places. Fake soldiers dying fake deaths together, friends until the end.

The lobby is empty. The adventure seems hollow. I won't be able to draft him, pass him and let him spin out challengers on my six. I won't be able to hear him tell me for the 55th time how much better Forza is with the wheel.

I'm all disjointed. The friends on my friends list were friends because Lethal was a friend. The death of Fastlane Ken was the one of the one two, and now Lethal is dead. That's the other shoe dropping. That's the end of the era. That's the last straw. There's almost no reason to go back online to XBox Live. I'm never going to meet anyone like him again. Anywhere. Ever.

I don't know what stage I'm at now. Anger I think. Lethalme was one of those men whom if you had them as a friend, and I did, you would never need a psychiatrist. I feel the planet one man lighter. Less alive. And I feel that somehow I have to be part of him now that he's gone. I have to let some of him live in me beyond the effects I experienced. But I have to move on. I can't sit here and regret that I don't have a voice recording all transcribed for my library. I have to be that guy. I'm angry at God. That's what kind of man we lost. The kind of man whose absence makes you mad that you have to live post-. 

I have to wring out all of my sentiments. Death comes to us all. Cancer. Well you only temporarily beat any disease. Sooner or later something kills you. We're all in remission. We all relapse. Life itself is a bedside vigil.So you do right while you're alive. You make your mark. You love your people and you make them remember the pride and the joy and the energy and fortitude of your life. The Lethal One did all that and I am glad to have known him in the narrow way I did, through this electronic network that augments our ability to cover distance and time. His life came through it and he touched me on this side. It was a human encounter and it came through in his voice and through his transmitted actions. It was a friendship that lasted for years. It has produced fond memories that will be with me until my end.

Goodnight Lethal.

### [Microsoft: Too Big And Failing](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2010/05/microsoft-too-big-and-failing.html)

Maybe it was Cringely who suggested it, but I'm sure the idea has been thrown around a lot. Break Microsoft up. I with the wisdom of that idea would finally get some traction inside Redmond. Or at least it's my interpretation that the big shakeup there is not going to result in the spinning off of companies.

The news is explained thusly:

> Robbie Bach and J. Allard, both of whom were both instrumental in creating consumer products through Microsoft’s Entertainment & Devices Division, [both are leaving the company as part of a broader reorganization, reports TechFlash](http://techflash.com/seattle/2010/05/bach_allard_leaving_microsoft_in_upheaval_of_consumer_business.html). As a result, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s CEO, will initially gain greater control over the division, which includes the Xbox, Zune and Windows Mobile products.

Ballmer? I'm trying to imagine how exactly Ballmer helps Microsoft do anything new or exciting. New and exciting is what must occur... What am I saying? That's never going to happen. Microsoft is a bit too far up in the woods for the culture of 'exciting' to permeate. Microsoft is a university and a universe. But it's sluggish and bound up in the slow that never quite leads the market. Of course, I'm biased. There are some outstanding things that Microsoft does, just not quite as great as they ought. They leave a lot of tech on the table - I mean an entirely too large chunk.

What I learned about Microsoft in my months in Redmond is that it's a Bank and a Marketing Machine, and because of those two things, all ideas are shaped in very particular ways, meaning stuff is matrixed out to the infrastructure and a lot of good stuff doesn't survive the process. Stuff that with the same amount of attention in a smaller organization might work just great. What saves Microsoft is the leverage the good-enough stuff gets when the market share gets past the adoption tipping point. Take Sharepoint for example. It is my studied opinion that Sharepoint is craptastic squared. There are so many other better ways to provide the functionality of Sharepoint that it's almost impossible for me to imagine somebody as smart as Ray Ozzie would be involved. It may have ingested all of Groove's technology, but it completely lost all of Groove's appeal. But now Sharepoint is too big to fail, and mediocrities all over the world will support it from now until doomsday. Proprietary lock-in. Leadership through religious fanaticism. That's what the Microsoft machine produces. Choice is the enemy, and therefore Microsoft has very few choice products. Yeah I use BaseCamp, and I'm looking at Google Sites.

Microsoft is the king of Gaming. So what disturbs me about this development is that the golden egg that is the XBox360 franchise is in jeopardy. Yes the Zune is a disaster. Everybody in that portable music player market got owned by Apple, just demolished. Window Mobile too. I never took that seriously - I mean did it ever even really compete with Nokia? Now that HP has Palm, there's no place for Windows Mobile to go. HP was the killer hardware for Windows Mobile back in the day. Those days are over. And that new roundy thing that looks like it feels like the Palm Pixi from Microsoft is probably going nowhere. So 2/3rds of this division is a nightmare. Painful.

If I were Ballmer what would I do?

I would abandon Microsoft technology and get some designers to design consumer products from scratch. It has to be as radical as GM spinning off Saturn. It might be too late, but it's got to be that independent. Let Microsoft use its money to allow multiple brands to emerge. XBox is a brand. Nobody cares that it's Microsoft. It works fine on its own. 

Here's what I'm suggesting - here me out. Look at your small consumer electronics companies. Microsoft has brain overkill for that product market. They only have to be marginally smarter and use their cheaper money (big deal) to make an impact in those markets, and downmarket from Apple's entry into the home electronics space, they can win. They can use the Microsoft mojo to hire top creative talent and try some really cool things. I'm going to list a handful of players I think Microsoft could outwit.

VTech. Audiovox. Jensen. Cobra. . But here's a real killer - a company and business that could have been inside Microsoft: Vizio. Yes them. Microsoft did nothing in TV, and now it's never going to catch up to Google TV whatever that might be. Before you knock the idea, consider Sync. Microsoft partnered with Ford and now their tech is making a big difference in car audio. If I was Ballmer, I'd be buying up shares of Panasonic, Sharp or Sanyo.

If Microsoft is going to survive as a huge company, then it needs to understand how to brand like a small company. It can learn from consumer goods companies like P&G, SCJohnson and Clorox.

### [Halo Reach Beta: First Look](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2010/05/halo-reach-beta-first-look.html)

I haven't written about games and gamers for a while. There really hasn't been much to talk about. I went down the rabbit hole of Mass Effect 2, and I'm not even sure if I wrote a review of that. It has taken up most of my gaming time before Splinter Cell Conviction. Now I finished SCC and am back to run through Mass Effect 2 a second time. Nothing's yawny, nor is anything compelling and I've been having flashbacks to Fallout 3, especially since I worked in DC. But I have to say that Modern Warfare 2 has taken all of my online buds away from me and so gaming is not so much fun any longer. Besides, I have other fish to fry.

Nevertheless, I discovered what I long forgot, that the Halo Reach beta was attached to ODST, and so I downloaded the gig last night and played it with my son until 2 in the morning. It's fairly impressive.

The first thing you will notice about Halo Reach is that it's kinda Halo and kinda not. You have to adjust your reflexes all over again. I'm not sure if that's back to ODST reflexes or Halo 2 or something else, but the layout feels strangely unfamiliar at first. Melee is no longer on the B button, and that's hella strange in Halo. Instead its RB. On the LB you have powers. Yes. These are old school spartans that have more up their sleeve than the Master Chief ever did. Shields, extra speed, and invisibility. Hmm. That makes for some interesting action, but wait. Did I mention that you can fly?

Flying (yuk yuk) adds a new dimension to gameplay that I haven't felt since Crackdown. And it's really smartly done. You are flying with momentum, not like Guilty Spark in build mode. And it works nicely to cushion falls from high places and to sneak up on unsuspecting enemies.

But really, the best thing about Reach is the speed. It is just as fast as Modern Warfare, and when your sprint ability is engaged on the LB you feel as though you're right back in those Clancy trenches. It's immediately familiar. Plus you have an indicator to know when your speed is over - so you can conserve your power. Another subtly brilliant touch from the masters at Bungie. (Or is this Bungie any longer?) Overall, the game is very fast and varied - you don't spend much time running around looking for weapons, you just pick a loadout and start running and gunning.

Additionally, you gain experience points (like MW2) and with those points you can upgrade your armor. Very cool. 

There is a new crop of weapons, some of which are brand new, some of which are kinda familiar going back to the original Halo. The needler is old looking but performs like the proper new needler. The standard assault rifle is right on. The same old pistol works predictably. There is a new needle pistol and needle rifle for Covy weapons. The needle rifle is extra cool.

Game modes are new and exciting. Invasion is my favorite. Spartans vs Covenant in a six on six with vehicles with escalating loadouts. You start as something simple and as rounds go by you get more loadout options and more weapons on the map. Arena mode I haven't played, but I think it takes ranking to a new level. Looks very interesting.

The maps are superb as usual. Growing on me as time goes by is a multilevel deally called Sword Bay or some such. Very different flavor of interior spaces, and windows I can tell are kinda optional in the beta. I didn't like it at first. Powerhouse is immediately cool, reminiscent of High Ground and Standoff. Boneyard is great. Open middle with high refineryesque buildings on both sides. Great for sniping OK for vehicles. Great for flying.

This is going to be a very great game, because the Beta is as good as Halo 2 was. I also particularly dig the new Social settings, so I can choose what kind of players to play with. Nicely.

### [The New Sam Fisher](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2010/05/the-new-sam-fisher.html)

I have finished the latest Splinter Cell on medium. It is, I think, finally mature and has superceded all of its previous incarnations. The Clancy Universe does need what's coming next and I'm sure that along with Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon, this kind of splinter operation will be nicely useful in the future.

Since the introduction of the idea that the various aspects of game play across the Clancy genres will blend and mix in the future, I have been thinking about their various strengths and weaknesses. Clearly, the coolest thing about Ghost Recon are the advanced warfighter roles. Using drones, armor and calling in air support are part of the most interesting aspects of game play. Capturing large patches of territory with ground forces are just what that's all about. I also enjoyed for a short period, Clancy's voice command in EndWar but the fact that my own online buds didn't made it far less enjoyable than it might have been. I found that the lack of good collab online really destroyed the possibilities, and it was too complex for simple head to head in real-time. Too complex to be fun, that is.

Ubisoft may yet have an MMO in the Clancy Universe. If it happens, I'll likely enjoy a role with Rainbow Six special forces if my online buds come along, but if not, I'll be happy to go it alone as Sam Fisher.

It turns out that as I finish up the Realistic mode (about halfway through) I am also now going back for a second bite at the Mass Effect apple. This time I've made my character a total renegade - I have less patience for the cinematics and storytelling. Fisher puts you into that mode of intense concentration and tests your patience for physical strategy - almost like The Portal (I haven't played Prince of Persia much, and I don't particularly like it). The only other single character that ranks up that high for physical awareness in the environment is the one from Assassin's Creed. Fable and Halo don't really come close. Crackdown might, but that's a different kind of game, more like Mercenaries 2, both excellent with M2 being my preferred game of the two.

After a few hours, Sam's actions come very smoothly. The Execute feature is really cool and even cooler in multiplayer. The changing of the entire scene to black and white to indicate stealth is a stroke of genius and it executes so smoothly. I am surprised, however, that this edition has decided not to give Sam access to any sniper rifles. Not that he can't snipe, and silently at that, but I think it was a good decision overall. Sam works best inside.

As for the Conviction plot and story. It's all first rate. The environments are excellent and the voice talent is superb. I like all of the choices they've taken, including the projected instructions, reverse fly-throughs and lack of level maps. It has taken long for this package to arrive, but it is a complete package.

### [Borderlands](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2010/03/borderlands.html)

Borderlands starts off exactly like a video from Gorillaz and it gets better from there. Like most gamers, I was surprised at the novelty of this little unknown FPS looter game, and now I'm many hours deep into it. 

Borderlands is a pretty straightforward adventure. You're a mercenary on a strange planet looking for alien technology and clues to a great treasure. All sorts of baddies inhabit the joint and all sorts of missions bring you closer to the goal, which is The Vault. You power up by experience points, competencies, dollars and increasingly powerful weapons all of which spurt out of the dying bodies of your foes, be they man or beast. You pick them up, buy and sell and try to stay alive. The entire shebang takes place on planet Pandora which is, like everything else in the game, a cel-shaded menagerie of desolation - kind of like the wild west desert from Warner Brother's Road Runner cartoon mixed in with a Robocop / Heavy Metal / Mad Max aesthetic. Actually, I'd say it borrows most from Mad Max - there's even a character called Mad Mel. So you're out there with your BDU of weapons, revolvers, repeaters, SMGs, rifles, saws, snipers, grenades and shotties leveling up through the wastes. 

What makes this super cool is the elemental mods. There are several 'elementals' that make your weapons more powerful. They are fire, acid, electric shock, and explosion. As you might imagine, when you're shooting the bad guys, it's much more fun when your bullets can make a splashy 1pH  shower that melts them into a green pool of goo. Did I mention that the death animations are awesome? The electric shock kills fry the skin off their bones.

Also, rabid fun are the grenade mods. You got your basic grenades and then you can make them sticky or bouncy or MIRVy or health stealing in addition to the elemental mods. Coolest. Grenades. Ever. Except they're generally not as deadly as grenades in any other game. They've been detuned. Considering what they do, it would make the whole game a no-brainer if they were as destructive as they should be.

The baddies themselves and just about everything else but the music are very imaginatively rendered. There's a great twisted sense of black humor underlying the entire game (if you haven't already surmised). And the best exemplars of that are the flaming badass psycho. Yes that's what they call them. Imagine a lunatic skinhead whose body is on fire running at you with a hatchet screaming at the top of his lungs like 'I'm taking my pound of flesh'. Hilariously creepy - more hilarious if you have an acid shotgun or an exploding sniper. Oh and don't forget the midgets with their shotguns. They have the helium voices and the recoil knocks them on their butts, then they get up and come at you again. 44 magnum to the head works every time.

There are so many missions, but the skill levels are tight. So if you find yourself outranked (you can see the rank level of your enemies) in a battle by more than one or two levels, you can pretty much forget it. Even though you can stop the action to do a bit of turn based fighting, switching weapons to find the weaknesses of your foes, they will outnumber and overwhelm you. Best to do some side missions and level up so that you're two or three levels up. Then the game is a lot more fun. 

Yes there are boss battles, no they're not that much fun, yes they will have you respawning like a newb, yes they are worth it. Yes there are interesting surprises and the joint is massive, if disjointed. I mean the place is very large and you need fast travel and vehicles (which it has) to get around.

You get to develop all sorts of skills. There are four characters from which to choose your avatar. I took the hunter, who specialized in sniping. My special power is a raptor familiar called 'Bloodwing' I send to take out an enemy at long distance. It can be armed with an elemental too, and for each level point my skills combined with those of my special power can be enhanced. Accuracy, loading times, loot rate of return - that kind of stuff. I haven't checked out the multiplayer and I think a MP coop would be very cool, but I'm late to the party getting this. 

There is no detail overlooked in Borderlands. It looks way simpler than it is and it plays very simply too, but they've engineered the hell out of it to deliver consistent fun and challenge. Not too dramatic, not too cliche and always something new to see. I think the cel shaded environments are brilliant and just the right mix of devastation and rube goldberg tech. This is a first rate game. Yeah. I love it. 

Is it awesome? No. The story is not the point and so there's no emotional support for the mission. You just loot and shoot - cockeyed mercenary stuff but not as fun as Mercenaries Two. Still, I'd give it five stars.

### [Echoes of the Rachni Wars](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2010/02/echoes-of-the-rachni-wars.html)

Echoes of the Rachni Wars  
  
I have begun and completed my next RPG, returning to the galaxy as Max Shepherd. Last time around I checked in Geth Hunting an interest in the tedium of searching planets for clues and fuel. This time around I have a better ship and can just send down a probe. Nice.

The return to the Mass Effect galaxy begins dramatically with the destruction of just about every link to the past, including your avatar, at first. It continues with with a larger cast of characters, a much improved combat system, a sweetly fine-tuned set of angelic and devilish responses and the same extraordinary real-time rendered cutscenes and excellent vocal talent that made the original such a compelling game.

The twist is now that Shepherd is a true galactic hero he has to fight against his reputation because he is allied with a non-governmental movement headed by The Illusive Man. This illusive man is, fortunately not so enigmatic as the illusive man of Half-Life. We understand his aims, if not his methods, but still very little of his origins.

I probably worked my way through the entire epic in about 30 hours over three weekends, and after the climax I was not particularly hungry for more. Still, this is clearly a game that begs to be played twice and I actually do want to go through it again with a bit more Renegade. I was balanced about 55 to 45 as the Paragon, which is actually a lot more difficult in this galaxy than it was to be a paragon in Knights of the Old Republic. KOTOR now seem incredibly slow and tedious by comparison. I think BioWare has struck the right balance between puzzle solving, moral choices, real-time and turn-based combat in this RPG. It moves at movie speed, and that's what's delicious about it. Lord of the Rings scale where you control the action. That's entertainment.

Interestingly, the most fascinating part of this particular epic was the part that I lost, which have particular poignancy as characters meet their fate at the end of the adventure. The game is setup so that in order to gain the loyalty of your specialists, you have to get off the main quest and do some favor for them. Some are conceptually simple, like shooting enemies in a boss-battle rite of passage. Others not so, like defending someone at trial, or pretending to be seduced. It was in these later two that I found myself outwitted by the logic of the game. Or more appropriately, I did not want my character to do those things which would have gained the loyalty of those specialists I was to help. In one case I consciously could not take the step, in the other case, I could not figure a way out of the impasse presented to create a win-win. It was only later upon reflection that the win-win scenario occurred to me, and so I had to lead the rest of the missions with the regret that I had failed one of my crew, which again had significant consequences as I led her through later battles. 

The more pedestrian aspects of gameplay have been improved as well. No longer was I required to land on innumerable tedious planets in search of precious metallic loot necessary to upgrade weapons and capabilities. A planetary scanner was a wonderful addition. As well, the detail paid to the encyclopedia of the galaxy was complete and proved to be fascinating to my daughter Scholar who followed along championing my efforts in this video drama. 

A fascinating move in this second installment was the inclusion of Mordin on the cast of characters assignable to the Normandy's crew. Previously, Shepherd worked his missions in the context of an historical understanding of the biological warfare against the species known as the Krogan. This time, Shepherd has to work with one of the engineers of that destruction on a personal basis. It gives a new immediacy and depth to the history as presented in the ME universe. The creation of the genophage is now not just an abstract point with which you can agree or disagree, you now have the complication of trying to make progress in your mission with one of the minds behind it.

It will likely take another two years for BioWare to sequel Mass Effect. Clearly there is much more action in store for Shepherd. I look forward to it.

--

There is only one thing that can top this, and if you're listening BioWare, hear this. Go after Iain M. Banks. Put the Culture into an RPG.

### [Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2009/11/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2.html)

_"Shepherd doesn't care about danger close."_

If you play Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2 on Normal, you will finish it in eight hours. If you play in on one of the more advanced levels, you'll probably have too much time to think about it. I did not want to think about it that long. It's an ugly story.

But there is plenty of good, and some bad in this installment. Is it worth it? Yes. Does it live up to the hype? Yes, but. 

First off, the 'yes but'. This happens to be personal. I've been an XBox gamer for about six years. I've seen all the drivers and shooters and I will have to say that Forza 3 and CODMW2 are the best of the best. I think there are about four more games that I will have to play in my life and then the whole thing will be over. These games are delivering all the realism, and a good bit of narrative. After this, there is nothing but more historically accurate games to play, and if I were rich, that's one of the businesses I would invest in. Hannibal at Cannae, Montgomery at El Alamain. Bradley at The Bulge. Nelson at Trafalgar. You get the picture.. So I'm at the point at which the context of the story is more interesting than the online action, and COD is built for online action, except that it generally has a superb campaign. This campaign? Not so superb, but still excellent.

Essentially, you have to believe that if an American gunned down 200 civilians at an airport in Russia, that Russia would launch a shock and awe against Washington DC. And if you can believe that, then all of this makes sense. The impact of this story was somewhat lost on me primarily because I wanted to play this game so badly. I confess that I just rushed through it, but it's all starting to blur, BUT. This game makes for some truly standout action.

What's unique about MW2 is that there is every kind of mission here. You can tell that the developers wanted to give the player every way to shoot in this game. In the story there are firefights that you essentially cannot survive unless you hunker down and draw fire behind a riot shield while your teammate flanks. This is the best new and original tactic in any shooter, of a much greater quality than that of Rainbow Six. There are stealth snow missions with silenced rifles. There is a  free for all mission where bullets are flying everywhere. There are great sniper missions, one from a helicopter. There are missions with a Predator, and with a robotic halftrack gun. There are buildings to storm on a large scale and small breaching missions with hostage rescue, there is half-dead hand to hand combat, and there is the soon to be legendary terrorist mission. 

I'm trying to think of another battle in a shooter where things got so ugly that I lost my appetite to play. Nothing comes to mind. The situation is this. You are called upon to infiltrate an enemy cell. The commander of that cell, Makarov is one step ahead of you. Makarov attacks an airport terminal in Russia and his crew, including you, casually walk in with machine guns and start mowing down civilians. The control of the system is restricted. You cannot break from the group, you cannot run, all you can do is shoot. I'll be honest, I couldn't shoot the civvies. I killed a couple that were dragging their bodies away at the very end, but for the most part I shot at the ceiling and at the guards that were shooting back. I kept wondering if my reticence would break cover, but as I said, Makarov was onto me the entire time. I, the American, am killed and my body left at the scene of the massacre so that the USA takes the blame, thus begins WW3. Except that it's not WW3 it's just America vs all of its current enemies and foes. 

The battle comes to Washington DC and you fight in suburban Virginia and on the Mall. It's chilling for both its realism and similarity to Fallout 3 when it comes to trenches near the Washington Memorial. Thematically, our creatives are hunkering down for some remix of American failure - the film 2012 debuts this week as well. 

There are vehicle battles in this version which are very fast paced which makes up for their somewhat clumsy control. I get it, there should be frenzied action, but on the Normal level, some of the running kills are a bit too easy and the physics seem a bit contrived. And so let me speak to that. I think that by including all of these different styles of combat into one game, Infinity Ward has reached their limits. They are very high limits, but it's starting to show on a couple of the edges. When it comes to wide open battles, Ghost Recon still sets the technical standard. I still prefer the Ghost Recon tightness and control even though the missions are a lot less realistic in terms of chaos and fog of battle. And for the close in battles and tactical missions, I still like Rainbow Six although some of that is being challenged by the breach missions of MW2 which are very well done. Call of Duty rules in sniping, period. But ODST has really raised the bar for the combination of mission types and control. I felt myself slipping back into my Halo reflexes many times. That's somewhat annoying. 

Here's where Call of Duty rules. The Brazilian favela fighting is brilliant. The combination of weapons, civilians, tight areas, sniping opportunities, dogs, confusion and chaos is unprecedented. I've been waiting to actually hear some voice talent other than Russian and Spanish in all of these shooters and COD delivers with Portuguese and Arabic, finally. The tactical missions, which I have just begun are also very very good. It's an innovation that takes what began in Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell did for training to the next level. Giving a nod to the training missions of the great PsyOps Mindgate Conspiracy, COD rules. 

Oddly enough, for the online, I don't expect much. I'm curious to see if the advantages gained by access to tanks, aircraft, dogs and artillery don't make for greatly unbalanced gameplay as they have in previous games. I much prefer the Halo approach where more powerful weapons and battlefield positions are objects of direct competition rather than perks for kills. But if there are zombie levels, I'll be happy for that.

All in all this is a great game, and I suppose that I will enjoy it as much as anyone my age and sophistication will admit, which is, admittedly declining. Then again, some people watch football.

### [Apple + Amazon + Adobe > Google](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2009/11/apple-gaming.html)

Somebody out there thinks that an Apple gaming platform would be really nice. That somebody is obviously not a gamer. 

The quick and dirty answer to the question of whether or not Apple could float a decent gaming platform out there is yes. yes in lowercase letters. If a reasonably priced Apple game plaftorm came out, it could do as well as the Nintendo DS in 2 years, but that's about it. It would have to be the iPhone or iTouch when they cost less than a Wii, which is when? Then they have to be as good as the Wii. But what drives the console market are blockbuster games with millions of units sold and DLC that keeps online players happy for months. There are NO games that compelling for the handheld market. Even Twitter can't make that kind of money.

But [what Wingert was thinking](http://blog.magme.com/2009/10/apple-gaming-console/) was that Apple TV could be a gaming platform and a convergence appliance. It can under one condition which is that Apple uses leapfroging technology for HD on demand and makes their deals with studios to get them into everywhere DirecTV, Comcast and Verizon FIOS already are. Perhaps many people don't recognize that I can get Netflix on demand right now through my XBox360. You've got to go a long way to beat out **Netflix** market share, and I already went through all the deliberations of thinking through Apple TV. The bottom line is that the people at Microsoft were already ahead of me and offered me cool stuff I never imagined I'd want. So I paid 150 bucks to get the big hard drive for my XBox and haven't looked back yet.

To compete with the $400+ platform that is the full blown XBox360 + XBox Live is a tall order for anybody. Apple is probably the one company that could do it, but they would have to make a big strategic investment and really desire to take over the world. I just don't see Jobs doing it - not when there's the publishing industry opportunity out there. Apple's entry into the eReader market (ha, I just named it  - the iReader) is 75% certain according to a Wall Street analyst I heard a few weeks ago. The entry of Barnes & Noble's **Nook** raises the stakes. So I was particularly intrigued when I got a notice on my last Apple Store download that the terms of service were changing. The first incredibly large paragraph of fine print was all about **Amazon's 1-Click**. That's enough cozy to make me think that Apple is doing the very right thing if it is partnering with Amazon and the iReader will be the high-end machine. For Apple and Amazon to join forces... well cloudwise it could be the beginning of a new era, and suddenly Google doesn't sound so cool any longer. I believe that Amazon is as technically smart as Google when it comes to infinite scalability, and Amazon has been around longer and I'd bet is better managed. 

Speaking of well managed. I have to say that I have a fresh coat of respect for Adobe. In my ridiculously vast personal library of software, I dug up an old copy of Acrobat for which I spent 300 bucks several years ago. It's still packed with features I haven't even bothered to learn, and it actually does things that I let my imagination imagine - like embedding interactive goodies into pre-existing PDFs. It's truly brilliant. So now I'm going to give **Adobe Flex** a good look, because I'm really starting to get fed up with my browsers.

Speaking of which, I turned on my process explorer and started tracking which of my applications are giving me the most page faults and gobbling up memory. It turns out to be SQL Server, which apparently launches itself with no prompting from me and no good reason. But right behind that is Chrome, which sprouts all kinds of pseudo-independent processes yet locks up all of them when one starts farting up the system. I don't know WTF is up with Firefox, but the latest version 3.0.13 has been a huge disappointment, which is why I'm using Chrome. Oh wait. I left that on there to have the Google Notebook Add-In.. Hmm. Maybe I should upgrade. 

But back to Apple gaming. There's one great game for the iPhone (and it wasn't Myst). It's called geoDefense. Awesome. I knew it the first time I saw it across the aisle on my plane home from San Jose. We'll talk if and when the tablet comes out.

### [ODST: First Look](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2009/09/odst-first-look.html)

The latest first person shooter to hit the XBox is Halo 3: ODST. I introduce it as an FPS because it compares well with others and invites such comparison as well as to the world of Halo. That's something unexpected.

Clearly, as Halo Wars has shown, some of the best talent in gaming is attracted to the Halo universe. More than any other series, save perhaps Dr. Who, Ender, Star Trek and Star Wars, the Halo universe continues to remain compelling over various tellings. It has been a book, an FPS, an RTS, a campaign game, a co-op game and now a squad game. Of course it has always been greatest, since Halo 2, as an online multiplayer. ODST is better because it is different.

**The Campaign**  
The first thing you notice about ODST is that it's quiet. It's night. You're lost. You're sneaking around trying to find your way around New Mombasa and there are patrols of Covies around every corner. But you've got silenced weapons, enhanced vision and your Halo skills. Fair fight.

The music is thematically very different. It's occasionally noir, jazzy, solemn. It feels like the music of the dark and lonely night. For moments, ODST approaches Splinter Cell. In fact, that's the first way to think about it as an FPS, because you are not the Master Chief, the monk's chant is not in the background, you are on Earth and there are no Elites to be found alive. What the heck is going on here?

You are on the front lines.

The hardest thing, and the greatest thing you have to get used to in ODST is that you start to realize how deadly the Covenant are. Sure, when Brutes were introduced in 3, it took a minute to figure them out, but after a while you mowed them down. You were the Chief. Now you're not and it takes two, maybe three melees to take out a grunt. And if you think you can just melee a brute because his helmet is off, think again. Your combat style has to change. Heroics will get you killed. You are not a Spartan. This is _**not**_ Sparta!

Instead, you find yourself gravitating to the shadows, making flanking moves, plinking off headshots with your incredibly accurate headbursting magnum. Double kill, triple, killtackular, spree, running riot. No wait. That doesn't happen in the campaign. That only happens in Firefight. In the campaign, you run, you hide, you search for health packs (which are plentiful on Normal), you make the most use of vehicles and other marines when you can find them. 

The most important thing is the feel of being differently abled than a Spartan, and I'd say that you take damage almost exactly like a Gear from Gears of War. You are more robust than Rainbow Six, so you live longer. In fact, in Firefight, you live a lot longer than you do in Halo multiplayer. It's more like the best battles of Halo Co-op without the aggrevating plot devices and cut scenes. Like Gears, it's straight to the action. So let's do that comparison.

**Firefight**  
Firefight is like Horde. Firefight is better than Horde but exactly in the same way that Halo is better than Gears which is according to your tastes. Firefight has vehicles. Firefight works at night. Firefight has more kinds of weapons. Speaking of weapons, did I mention that ODSTs can carry 12 grenades? Yep. Makes up for the lack of dual wielding.

Firefight is organized into 3 sets, each with 3 rounds each with 5 waves. That's 45 waves of baddies to shoot, snipe, melee and blast your way through. Me and and two other guys got up to 3.3.4 on Normal but couldn't get past 1.1.4 on Heroic. The fifth wave is always the toughest. Remember what I said about the difficulty with Brutes? Imagine three chieftains swinging hammers with invulnerability on. Literally brutal. And boy to they talk smack.

If you do good, you can earn extra lives and weapon drops, but the Covenant get power ups too. Let me tell you something. There's a skull called 'Catch' and it means that the Covies throw lots of grenades. The guys at Bungie amped up the AI and those grunts are deadly with grenades. And you can no longer dodge the Phantom drop ship cannons, you basically hide until they're gone. And even worse are those pesky Jackal snipers. Carbines hurt. On the map we played, Crater, putting snipers beyond our immediate reach (and not part of the enemy count) made a huge difference.

You need to do a lot of weapons trading in Firefight. More than you do in Halo multiplayer. A new tactic we've used is to get a pistol (which we've got some stock of) and go into the field and find a hammer or needler, then bring it back to base, trade back down and drop it for later use. Near the end of the wave, you get less and less time to scavenge ammo.

I haven't figured out all of the skull power ups that the Covenant get other than the basic three. But I know that when they're all turned on (because there are bonus rounds between sets) you find yourself banging away at grunts who just won't die, that is unless you headshot them with your trusty magnum, which is super deadly head on, but won't leave a mark if you shoot them in the back and can't penetrate a shield worth diddly.

No swords. Don't miss 'em. No BRs, no big deal. The minigun rules. The magnum is awesome. The fuel rod gun is very useful. The needler is a staple of combat, the shotty is not. That's because you generally don't want to be so close that you have to rely on melee and by the time the shotgun is available, the Covies have damage skulls, anyway that's how I've been playing. 

Grunts are tougher, Jackals are peskier and you can't blow through their shields as easily. Brutes come in larger packs and the chiefs use invulnerability. Buggers have been cranked up a notch and are way more difficult and deadly. No Flood. AI is better all around. New Mombasa is gorgeous.

**So.**  
The best thing about ODST is that you play Firefight with your friends, not with anonymous jerks like in Halo multiplayer, and suddenly Halo is civilized again. You focus on fighting the bad guys, and their AI is so good that outsmarting them is non-trivial. Smarter than Rainbow Six, smarter than Gears, as deadly as COD Modern Warfare. 

**On the Downside.**  
The VISR is useless during the day. I'm sure they wanted it that way. It would have complicated things to have multiple modes on the X button. 

**On the Whole**  
Solo play in the campaign is dramatically different as ODST. This is a great way to extend the series. Firefight means that tactical fighting has returned to Halo. You must flank. You must coordinate. You must have ammo and weapons tactics. There are no patterns to memorize, you have to think on the fly. It's right where I like it, more Rainbow Six-ish but nowhere near as predictable, more Gears-ish but very Halo. Definitely an improvement over Halo multiplayer, where people gripe in  the lobby and say 'Veto! Veto!'. No more of that.  No vetos for ODST.

### [More Zombies](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/09/more_zombies.html)

I just got a copy of [Dead Rising](http://ww2.capcom.com/deadrising/). Now I know how much I don't particularly dig zombie games. This one has a decent premise, and it reminds me very much of one of those zombies at the mall movies. The execution is fairly decent for a third person romp & stomp, with control that feels roughly like GTA. But it just doesn't quite cut it for me. I'm sending it back. This is the second ever photographer-hero game I've ever played. The first one was on Nintendo with those Pikachu characters, remember them? You get points for taking cool pictures of the action in the game. With zombie violence, it's a bit voyeuristic, and considering the clumsiness I felt with these controls, I lost interest is trying to score big with it. The hero runs like he has bad knees and the gun has no reticle. It's rather cool that you can pickup objects like steel bookshelves and cash registers to beat upside the heads of your pursuers, but it gets tired. I got two miserable achievements and it's back into the orange envelope. Nice try guys.

### [There's a Hole in the Sky Through Which You Can Fly](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/09/theres_a_hole_i.html)

Awesome. I just finished Prey and was suggesting that what they've done with gravity was definitely going to be copied. Voila. This is exciting. It's almost enough to make me want to be a PC Gamer. Well, I've been thinking about that for a while, ever since I realized that XBox 360 controllers can work via USB into PCs.

## August 29, 2006

### [Prey](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/08/prey.html)

Prey is one of the most innovative and subtly annoying games I've ever played on the 360. It shows both brilliance and age.

What I know of Prey is that it is an age-old project finally brought to life by its developers. I recall seing a preview of it at last year's E3 or someplace important. Everybody was treating the authors with much respect so I was interested in looking forward to the game. But I completely forgot about it and it wasn't until about an hour into the game that I realized where I was.

1. Prey is the creepiest game I've played in a long time. It's the slimiest world I can recall being in, and the alien biotech is truly alien. I finished the game and I still don't have names for the creatures and weapons.

2. The use of gravity in this game makes its style of play and the environments extremely unusual. It makes you wonder why nobody else has done anything like it. It makes me want to say that Prey is really the first thoroughly 3D game in the industry. In the world of shooters this innovation is totally unique, like the psychic powers of Psy-Ops and the unusual skills of Riddick in the Escape from Butcher Bay game. There is nothing to compare with the cool of standing sideways on a wall, aiming to the left and watching an enemy fall up.

3. Prey's fleshing out of the game is juvenile. There are really no humans to interact with that add to the creepiness of the overall storyline. Maybe it's because I'm fresh from several months of playing Oblivion but the human, even the beastial element of the AI is pretty lousy. It's not mucked up completely with idiot boss battles (there are only about 4), but for a would be Cherokee warrior, your protagonist is never called to do anything but destroy every living thing in this world.

4. The environments are spectacular. They go from the DOOMlike dark and claustrophobic, to the intricate three dimesnional mazy, to the double gravity system of twin asteroids.

5. The dialog sucks, period. The game could use a whole lot more humanity and voice acting. In the beginning, things were very compelling because it appeared that there would be a lot of humans that you would encounter in the space ship that would assist you through various parts, but that never materialized. Instead we just had zombies. I will give props to the use of the radio DJ, but the parallel plot never materialized, therefore making it a real throwaway effect.

6. The spirit world life-restoring minigame is inspired. That's really a great concept and I expect that many games should copy that. It never really got tiring although I thought it would, but the idea that you have to earn your life back is great. On the one hand, it obviates the need for formal checkpoints, and you never have a situation where you get caught at a checkpoint with 2% life that sometimes ruins really good games. Secondly, when you're never guaranteed to return to your savepoint with full life, that's a very good challenge too. Very well done.

7. On the whole it's not a very challenging game when played on the normal level although there were some puzzles that had me really stumped for a long time. Some of the more interesting puzzles and levels could have been a whole lot harder and I'm glad they left them simple, because playing in 3D where any wall or floor can become a cieling is very radical. That could burn out your brain.

8. The Ghost walking is also brilliant. I just wish the ghost could have been a little bit more deadly with his bow. Still, it's a great plus to know that you can work this kind of magic. I loved it in PsyOps and it was done well here too.

9. The eagle familiar was sometimes useful and sometimes distracting. I would have liked a way to power it up to help fight off some enemies, or be able to make it do specific tasks.

10. The multidimensional references back to places on Earth was a brilliant touch that added to the creepiness, especially when the jukebox could be heard. On the other hand we could have done without the slot machines.

Overall, this is a very innovative game you just don't want to miss. If they add some of the unique elements to their next game, it will be a triumph. Prey is a flawed classic.

### [Blazing, Boring Angels](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/08/blazing_boring_.html)

I've finally raised my head out of Oblivion after three months and started to play other games on my 360. The first of these is Blazing Angels - Squadrons of WW2. Though I just finished Call of Duty 2, I'm still not sick of WW2, but man what a letdown Blazing Angels has turned out to be.

The tutorial went pretty nicely. In general, when it comes to flying games, I suck. But I don't suck enough to not have fun, just when it comes to competition. So you might find me playing Crimson Skies solo mode, but I've long since abandoned hope on XBox Live. So I was pleased to find that I could fly this plane pretty well. Hmm, this might be enjoyable after all, but I figure that it's bound to get tougher.

It does get tougher, on my ears. Since I'm spoiled by the best combat dialog, like that in Star Wars Battlefront and Ghost Recon, but the fifth time I hear 'Tommies and Yanks, Tommies and Yanks' from a German fighter pilot (and since when can we hear their radios?) I'm completely sick of this game. The gratuitous dialog just ruins the whole game. Not since True Crime: Streets of NY have I wanted so desparately to turn off the volume.

I'm sorry but this one is going right back to Gamefly. Tomorrow.

### [Mehrunes' Razor](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/08/mehrunes_razor.html)

I have come to as close as I can see, the end of my adventures in the realm of Tamriel in the Cyrodillian Empire which is on the verge of collapse.

That may sound very strange to those of you who are not gamers, but I have spent over 200 hours in a game that is about as rich as any novel I have ever read. I'm not sure there are any books I've ever spent that much time in. Anyway, the game is [Oblivion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion) and I have finally mastered just about every aspect of it, and I took my time. It is widely acknowledged as one of the best role playing games ever, and obviously I agree. It is the second that I've played in the Elder Scrolls series, and whereas I tired of working the first one, this one kept my attention all the way through, and still does. Except now I want to be evil.

I rather hope that my experience in the game is instructive and somehow indicative of human nature. It basically works like this, although there are simple pleasure kind of exceptions, once you have done all the good anyone expects of you, your attention and desires turn to evil. This is precisely where I now stand as Champion of Cyrodil, Arch Mage of the Mage's Guild, Master of the Fighter's Guild, Grand Champion of the Arena and Listener of the Dark Brotherhood. I've saved the empire, as it were, now I want to see what damage I can do.

And fortunately, the creators of the game have made an added package which allows you to quest for the ultimate weapon, a blade called 'Mehrunes' Razor' which allows you to kill enemies with one blow. I doesn't work all of the time. In fact, it's less reliable than other weapons I have used, and herein lies something we may add to Cobb's Rules as 'Mehrunes' Razor':

**Given the chance to kill with one blow, one will strike as many times as necessary.  
**

And still you will not doubt the weapon, because you have seen it work. In fact, this is exactly what happened in the game. The first time I used the weapon, it worked as advertized. I slew a Gloom Wraith, a not inconsequential creature, on the first shot. Subsequently it took six or seven blows to defeat enemies with the Razor.

I see this pearl of wisdom in the context of a couple other aphorisms. One is "What do you give the man who has everything: An irresistable opportunity the throw it all away". And "People don't have weaknesses, they merely overuse their strengths."

### [Gangstas (Not) Played](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/07/gangstas_not_pl.html)

Snoop Dogg just [got fired](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/12/1727254&from=rss).

> simoniker writes "Midway CMO Steve Allison has been talking about why he thinks the urban game genre isn't worth entering, suggesting of the cancelled Snoop Dogg/John Singleton collaboration Fear & Respect, which was in development at Midway: 'We killed Fear and Respect... because we have enough data-points to know the hood thing is basically dead. It would be dead before it came out. And you don't want to come out on a dead vibe.' Do people really not care about GTA-style urban shooters any more?"

Anything that empties the future pockets of John Singleton & Snoop Dogg is cool with me. I think they played themselves. It's time for their time to be over. Snoop hasn't said anything in rap worth saying since Gin & Juice and Singleton's attempts at gritty urban drama in 'Four Brothers' just doesn't cut it. So anything that gets them out of future markets with their same tired formulas is just peachy.

Having said so, I enjoyed the hell out of the experience of being low man on the ghetto pole in [GTA San Andreas](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/06/san_andreas_1.html), for about ohh 30 maybe 40 hours of play. Then the grind of Do or Die just became tiresome, just as did the suspension of morality one has to engage to enjoy shooting cops and trifling bangers. Not that destruction in and of itself should be off-limits in gaming, just that doing so on the wrong side of the battle of good vs evil is something I simply can't sustain, nor much recommend. Revulsion gets you in the end, and for those who don't have this problem, well, the smaller that market the better.

### [A Successful War on Drugs](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/07/a_successful_wa.html)

What if you could do this in the real world?

> Electronic Arts has announced that it has confiscated approximately 15 trillion gold pieces from within its long running PC massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) _Ultima Online_, which the company claims was obtained “through the abuse of bugs or exploitation of game mechanics”.

### [PSP vs Essentialism](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/07/psp_vs_essentia.html)

_Image is Nothing. Obey Your Thirst._  
-- Sprite

There's some jabber going around about alleged racial stereotypes in PSP advertisements. Obviously they're not taking direction from Sprite. Or maybe they are, and they're just thirsty for nonsense. It's all over this ad and some like it. [Joystiq has the other two as well](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/04/ad-critic-sonys-racially-charged-psp-ad/).[![Sony_whiteiscoming_ad_1](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/images/sony_whiteiscoming_ad_1.jpg "Sony_whiteiscoming_ad_1")](https://cobb.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/sony_whiteiscoming_ad_1.jpg)I see what the big deal is, I guess. It's controversial. Why? Because it's using a black woman to represent a videogame. What nerve! I mean black women (tm) are only supposed to be represented in ways and means approved by the Black Women's Collective. I know they have an address on K Street but I left it on my other PC. For the time being we have to listen to every loser with a laptop express their concern for the images of black women.  

But seriously, you can only give folks so much time with this kind of silliness. The serious criticism is pretty much the same as I made against the Washington Post, people are always ready to substitute new stereotypes for old ones about blackfolks. Why? Because they don't know enough black diversity to subsume those fictions. The only 'real' blackfolks they know are those who conform to some racial stereotype, and thus provides a robust set of embarrassments and false platitudes about black capability. But this is not about black people at all, but a black colored video game.  

So the people who should be the least upset about these are blackfolks themselves. Why? Because we know more than enough real blackfolks to dismiss stereotypes. But what exactly is the stereotype here? Black submission? I'm really not going to guess, because anybody who wants to take the symbolism out to that level needs to have their head checked. You can't do that without recognizing that (gasp) the first PSPs, a killer product, were black. Blacks were here first! Big whoop. This is all about fashion, not sociology. No amount of whinging can change that.. or maybe it already did.

![Sunglassessumm](https://cobb.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/sunglassessumm.jpg "Sunglassessumm")Speaking of fashion what is going on with sunglasses? I mean here in California, all the rage is these big fat Jackie O looking goggle-riffic wraparound sunglasses? It's so 80s. I'm kinda wishing I had a big vocab about the pieces and parts of glasses. You know where the over the ear part meets the front part of the frame. Usually they're skinny, now they're as fat as the kind geezers with cataracts wear. Basically, you can't see people's eyeballs any longer, not even from the side. I think that means people are basically getting more insecure about being seen in public. It's the perfect accessory for the Hummer crowd.

### [Kids & Multimedia](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/06/kids_multimedia.html)

As part of my continual bashing of people who don't get it with respect to technology and kids, I offer yet another thought provoking moment...

Seriously though, I just completed burning a CD for my daughter's 3rd grade book report. The heck you say? Yes, she's going to do a presentation for the class about McGrowl, the detective dog, but her presentation will have a soundtrack. In fact, she's dressing up like a Jamaican Chef and pretending to do a cooking show. Huh? What? F9 is a genius like that. After my announcer voiceover intro and the reggae music fades, she's going to kick it up a notch, Bam!

For props she has a large orange mixing bowl. "If you like dogs and puppies, ya put 'em in", she'll say in her pretty good patois. "If you like superheroes, ya put 'em in, mon". She'll mix it up with a wooden mixing spoon and then pull out the McGrowl book. Neat huh?

There's more, but I'll spare you the details, except for this. She even made me record one of those speeded up voice disclaimers at the end of the soundtrack. I tried to convince her that I could just change the tempo and leave the pitch alone, but she thinks it's cute that I sound like a squirrel. Sheesh. But that's her creative vision and I really want to work with her again. You know how it is in this town...

Now that I think about it, this isn't the first time. Boy did a complete radio program complete with traffic report and a special bulletin. Not long before that, he put together a powerpoint presentation on China that had at least 50 slides. F11 put together a commercial spot for a cereal complete with a custom soundtrack I burned onto CD. And here I'm thinking how special I felt when I got to be the kid that advanced the filmstrip. I didn't know it but my kid's middle school has a daily news video show they produce on campus. Something's up in education, and it sounds all good to me.

I'll take more swiping swing though. I'm not sure if I'm repeating myself though. Almost any interactive videogame that's not completely boring or vulgar is better than watching television.

Parents who dismiss the gaming industry today are just as bad as parents of yesteryear who dismissed MTV. That is to say that a lack of informed opinion and experience with the medium will only lead to a complete inability to offer constructed criticism. The market will be overwhelming soon enough and all people with no contextually relevant critical skills will be just as lost with gaming tomorrow as they are with hiphop music today. You'll never control it with a V-Chip, you can only offer mature guidance. And while there isn't global convergence today, the same skills are applicable across all these media, and it all involves interactive critical discernment.

If you don't know what makes a game credible, or a program credible, or a powerpoint credible or a website credible, you're going to be the victim of scams. You and/or your kids will be owned, phished and namejacked and otherwise doomed to the fate of the clueless newbs of the 21st century. If only your kids have online friends, and you cannot believe that responsible adults can be, then you are abandoning that one place kids are free to be totally expressive and free - online.

In a neighborhood like mine, there are only two activities that aren't micromanaged and adult-supervised. That is skateboarding and online. And the panic that is sweeping through PTAs over sites like MySpace is really only the beginning. When [legislators start to legislate](http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/308396.html) and wags start to pontificate, we're going to lose more folks to uninformed blather, and the creative and responsible people like me who have no fear of the domain are going to get squeezed out of the conversation by paranoia.

I'm going to continue to write about online, games and gaming. This is where some of the most interesting creative and intellectual productions in our society are happening. If it becomes vulgarized by abandonment of thoughtful criticism, it will go the way of hiphop. And some of you forget that Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock were making hiphop in the 80s. Think about it.

### [Puritans I Like](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/06/puritans_i_like.html)

I was quite amused by this take on gaming by a cat named [Rabbit.](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/24946) He essentially says that games make him work and that's not what games are supposed to do. They're supposed to allow you to have fun, so why keep some large portion of what's distributed undiscovered and unplayed simply because a gamer hasn't gone through the ardor of levelling up. It's a complaint I've felt but it never really itched me enough to scratch in public. Now after some thought, I think there something else to be said. First, to wit:

> _"I play games to escape. To go somewhere else. But our industry has so ingrained this concept of 'earning' our fun that the best is somehow always saved for last. Like modern day Puritans, we've convinced ourselves that we are not worthy of that for which we've already paid. Sinners in the hands of an angry god, we don't deserve our fun until we pay in blood."_

Like Rabbit, I'm a gamer with a job, which is to say specifically, I am not one of those strange individuals whose 'life' consists of levelling up and destroying other online players and mouthing off about it. Like in any competitive endeavor gaming has its share or people who make a point of addressing the humanity of others strictly through the prism of the game itself. If you've ever been to a bank teller who looks at you differently depending upon how much money you have in your account, you know what I mean.

So I'm thinking about Rabbit's gripe and then I think about kids online who spend half their time using cheat codes, glitching and modding. Sure it might be the programmer's fault for allowing cheats, glitches and mods, but the gamer who hacks the game is destructive of the spirit of the game. These are not the kinds of people I want to game with or spend any time with in real life. I prefer folks who enjoy playing by the rules, even if, and probably especially if that means work.

I just learned, for example, in Oblivion, that there is a cheat. You essentially can kill a particular individual in such a way that his pocket never empties of gold. He has about 50 pieces of gold, and so if you kill him 1000 times, you can 'earn' 50,000 in gold, which is enough to buy weapons of mass destruction and beat the game in no time. BTW, I've spent about 95 hours in the game and I'm level 25. I've finished about 38 quests and generally had a ball doing so.

What makes Oblivion in particular an interesting game vis a vis its hewing to the Puritan standard is how well its challenges match your skills all through the game. In a way the game is learning along with you. If you go to Black Dog Camp when you are level 1, there will probably be a wolf there to challenge you. You can beat a wolf with an ordinary iron sword. If you return to the same place in the game at level 20, there will probably be 2 bears and an evil wizard.

What I can't stand, I say repeating myself, is listening to knuckleheads bragging about how they breezed through Black Dog Camp by jumping up and down in the fire three times so that the bad guys disappear through a glitch in the softwear. See what I'm saying?

Now there is a game that has made good sense of Rabbit's complaint - since surely it has occurred to game developers before. That game is my other favorite, Project Gotham Racing 3. In the prior version, you essentially had to beat every AI driven car in every race on every track to get the fastest car in the game. At the time it was the Cerbera Speed Twelve. This time around every track is unlocked and you can buy the fastest car in short order. The trade off is apparent. In this case it's the Ferrari F50GT. Like the Cerbera, it has got quirky power and speed, so it takes some time to learn how to control it. In other words, newbs will crash it into every wall as will cheaters. In the first version, there was a way to purchase a download of the Cerbera. When we witnessed people crashing it, we knew they were newbs.

The point is simply this, in sophisticated games, you can tell who has earned their way up and who has cheated their way up. For single player games I might concur with Rabbit's sentiment, but online as in real life, I prefer playing with people who work.

### [Return to Mugello](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/05/return_to_mugel.html)

The other night I downloaded a new demo game from XBox Live. How cool is that, neh? This was MotoGP 06, the latest version for the XBox 360. This was the first game I ever played on XBox Live (or maybe it was Mechassault). And the memories came rushing back.

This is good old-fashioned fun, if you can call racing online in realtime with 7 other human beings and 8 AIs 'old-fashioned'. But this is what we did in the good old days when we only had the XBox Live demo disk. Mugello, Mugello and more Mugello. One track, lots of gamers and huge hoots of fun.

The track is exactly as it was before only sharper. There are more details in the backgrounds and that little bit of annoying and challenging blur as you hit the gas is gone, but the feel is very much like it always was. One thing that the Moto GP folks have going for them is by far the most interesting set of tracks in all of online racing, and they must have nailed it the first times out because there are no changes. What we online racers know is that Nurburgring is substantially different between Project Gotham Racing 2 and Forza Motorsport with Forza coming out on top for detail and presumeably, accuracy as well. But in PGR3, the track is much more closely aligned with what the Forza guys did, and so, I believe it is more accurate. So here's the deal. If MotoGP 06 has Nurburgring, it will be the absolute bomb.

I'm very much looking forward to the new game, and meeting some old friends online that I haven't seen in years.

### [I Told You Sony](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/05/i_told_you_sony.html)

[Slashdot confirms](http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot?m=5504) my predictions:

> To put things in perspective, the Curmudgeon Gamer has created graphs showing inflation-adjusted console costs. The PS3 is far from the most expensive console in history (that would be the Neo Geo, at almost $1000 adjusted price), but that hasn't stopped analysts, publishers, developers, and gamers from grumbling about it the week after E3. ABI Research has publicly stated that Sony may have 'hamstrung' itself with the console's high price. Publishers and developers are worried because (despite Sony's protests to the contrary), developers just don't have the kits to make the games. From the GameDaily article: "'A lot of developers have not gotten the kits,' said Sega of America president Simon Jeffrey while attending E3 last week. 'There certainly will not be a lot of titles available.' The result is that publishers that do want to take part in the PS3 launch will have to release games that don't fully take advantage of the power of the Cell processor, added Jeffrey."

Here's what I said [before](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/02/sony_past_tense.html) comparing Sony to Apple:

> Sony puts rootkits on CDs, fueling rage, hatred and alienation among former devotees. The Minidisc never goes anywhere and the usage of DATs is considered selling out in the underground of hiphop. Nobody can pronounce VAIO and nobody really wants VAIO laptops any longer. They're overpriced and they break. Sony is so over.

### [Infinite Hours of Oblivion](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/05/six_hours_of_ob.html)

If you asked me to name the most sophisticated pastime available in the world of entertainment, I would have to say that thing that is the book circle. Half of my life I've attempted to cajole people I've had the opportunity to meet in the flesh to spend as much time as I do reading the books I think matter. I had no idea that would be a failed enterprise, and with that beloved community in mind I have wasted many years on the web in pursuit of some sort of collective pseudo mind meld. And so if I interpret the gist of Thomas Mann correctly, I've been on a fool's errand. The individual, like the cheese, stands alone; absorbing, fermenting, smelling solo, hoping only one day to be appreciated at cocktail parties among the brainy, powerful, wealthy and beautiful. End of metaphor.

What I have found to be a much more reliable form of sophisticated shared experience has been online gaming.

I'm a writer you see. All day it's what I do. Except that I write for computers, which in turn, control people. I've been aware of this fact since day one. I am one of those people who hates to be misinterpreted, so I have some satisfaction in knowing that those fruits and delights my programs serve up cannot under any circumstances be delivered to those who don't follow my precise instructions. This is the secret power of the programmer. We change human behavior. It's the same writer's conceit, the same as any Hollywood screen or jokewriter. We change lives.  

Now I recognize that online gaming is not really the be all and end all. It could be, but it's going to take another generation for it to evolve to the level of sophistication and interactivity of, say playing in a marching band, and probably two before improvisational jazz. But hey, a flute has too many buttons for most of us. When I'm doing real-time analog first person gaming, all I care is that my child can catch the ball. For most of us, what's out there works just fine.

I have yet to play an MMORPG for a substantial amount of time. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, I have a fairly high resistance to cheesy sword & sorcery. Your basic dungeons & dragons stuff doesn't impress. Secondly, I've found some of the players, well.. too many of the players to be just juvenile or perversely odd. Let me qualify this by saying that the bulk of my experiences are dictated by [There](http://www.there.com/index.html), [SecondLife](http://secondlife.com/) and the original Everquest. I have flirted with getting World of Warcraft this year, but I have yet to make the leap. But there is something about this league of PC gamers who get completely immersed that feels a bit too weird.

Now I can say that I do want game immersion. I was a big fan of Myst from day one, and killed countless hours hacking and slashing through those lovely logical jungles. I also enjoyed the early Tomb Raider stuff, and [The Dig](http://www.webhallen.com/prod.php?id=18882) earlier still. But there seems to be a fine line between immersion and obsession that I simply cannot cross. Being committed to online millions in the form of some avatar is just wrong. Those who know me know that I'm all about do instead of be, and most of the MMORPGs seem to be about be. So I like online shooters and racers, but not those in which you invest significant time trying to seduce other people into recognize your avatar socially. See the difference?  Besides, who's going to outdo The Sims?

If I'm going to sink hours upon hours of time in a virtual world online, I prefer real-time strategy. So you will have found me fairly deep into Rise of Nations. [Rise of Legends](http://www.bighugegames.com/riseoflegends/) is <strike>coming</strike> here(!)and having seen the preview, I think it's going to be even better. When it comes to RPGs, I truly enjoyed Knights of the Old Republic all the way up the the final boss battle, which in the end seemed completely superfluous. KOTOR2 held my attention for about one fifth the time and then I dropped it like a hot rock. **Fable,** depsite the criticism that it was too short, seemed to me to have achieved perfect balance. That's one I played twice.

None of this, however, compares to the passionate work that is the creation of [Bethesda Softworks](http://www.bethsoft.com/), Elder Scrolls IV, Oblivion. Imagine Myst but bigger, scarier, and richer. Even for an inveterate player like myself, the visual experience is stunning. There are areas within the world of Oblivion that generate visceral reactions as powerful as any film visual. Oblivion is, hands down, the grand universal heavyweight dominating champion of RPGs.

### [Because My Kids Have Homework](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/05/because_my_kids.html)

The [following comes as no surprise](http://latimesblogs.typepad.com/videogames/2006/05/who_are_gamers.html) to conservative dads:

> Here are five fun facts culled from the event sponsored by the [Entertainment Software Association](http://www.theesa.com/).
> 
> 1) The average game buyer is 40 years old.  
> 2) The average game player is 30 years old.  
> 3) Thirty-eight percent of all game players are women.  
> 4) Twenty-five percent of Americans over the age of 50 play video games.  
> 5) Forty-four percent of game players say they play games online one or more hours per week.

The boy has demonstrated that he has some of the same tastes in gaming as the old man. This is satisfying. But he and the girls cannot play Monday through Wednesday, period. And homework always comes first.

**In other E3**  
There's a lot of interesting numbers coming out of E3 here in town this week. I'm Tivoing the G4TV broadcasts, but I'm so deep into [Oblivion](http://www.elderscrolls.com/) this week that I haven't paid much attention to the news except for the occasional Slashdot coverage. The rumors about Sony's upping the price on the PS3 are true which is just going to accrue points for MSFT.

All this motion-senstive controlling, I think is a mediocre to poor idea. Nothing shouts 'newb' like somebody working their shoulders when gaming. Quite frankly the whole thing makes no sense to me from an ergonomic perspective. As I was implying here, it's all in the fingers. I mean look at classical pianists. The most sensitive and lightning fast moves humans can produce come from eye-hand, not eye-shoulder coordination. Fighter pilots, diamond cutters, any ultimate skill of the sort you can name are going to do their best work with their fingers. Making people sweat when they could sit is for [the DDR crowd](http://www.ddrfreak.com/). Not buying it over here.

### [360 Finally](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/05/360_finally.html)

It's 4 months after Christmas and I finally got my 360.

Was it worth the wait? Well, since I'm a grownup, the answer has to be yes. It's got what I liked about the original XBox and more, so of course I'm satisfied.

Anybody who has been poking their heads in at the local Best Buy has seen Call of Duty playing on the HD Samsung on the display. Having the 360 at home is even more mind-rocking, especially if you have an HD set. I don't, but it's still pretty awesome. So the first question is whether or not new 360 games look better than old XBox games without the addition of HD and the answer is a resounding yes. Sure 'Call of Duty 2' has been hyped, but not overhyped. It's that good, and the standard of graphics is that much better. The same is true for PGR3 and Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, two other must-have titles that I have.  

I'm simply shocked at how often you hear arguments about how many PS2s are out there and how the greater number of titles makes them a winner against XBox. That's completely silly. As every real gamer knows there are good games and there are great games. The very good games and the great games are almost always on both platforms. There are only a few exceptions, namely (Guitar Hero, Resident Evil) and (Halo, PGR, ) for the XBox. It really comes down to that handful, which is essentially nothing if you are a PC gamer as well.

News from the talk on XBox Live.

- A big Microsoft / Bungie announcement on the last day of E3 on 'The Forerunner Project'. Everybody knows it's Halo 3. The question is when does it ship? I say 30% odds of it shipping this Christmas.
- If the PS3 goes for 600 bucks, it's the beginning of the end for the PS3.
- Gamers hate the new controllers for both the PS3 and the Wii.

More on the actual games later.

The new wireless controller eats batteries pretty quickly. Then again I'm sure I've done some 20 hours of gaming over the past two weeks. Other than that, thinking that I might hate it because it's too small - I basically retrained my hands. Now I'm cool and I almost never think about it. They must have known something like this might happen. I've got a good 50 foot range on the wireless controller and no lag or anything like that. Once again the ergonomics pros at Microsoft have pulled off a surprising success.

It took me about 30 minutes to setup the new console. It was a snap, actually easier than the first time. All of my old Live info moved over with no problem.

The new panel interface is also a fairly brilliant piece of design. There's a huge amount of information that can be set from there, which I've yet to navigate. But it's very intuitive for a guy like me and a significant improvement over the prior version. Concretely, the XBox Live panel being available at anytime is brilliant. The ability to send game invites to multiple friends is a big improvement. The update of friends coming available is very nice, especially now that you can see, essentially when somebody accepts a friend invite. The messaging interface defaulting to voice is very nice. Some of the defaulted selections could use a bit more contrast in the default skin. I've moved it to the Halo theme and it's better.  I would have been happier to allow gamers to upload any avatar icon and leave it to feedback to determine whether or not they were too 'underground' rather than have it the way it seems to be now.. locked up with a dozen goofy defaults. MSFT needs to publish an avatar studio.

I have mixed feelings about Microsoft Points. They work too easily. It's a convenient way to spend too much money on gaming.

### [Sony: Past Tense](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/02/sony_past_tense.html)

Sony has been rolling up lame in a lot of areas, but this latest announcement reaches new heights of suckitude.

First, the PS3 is delayed. Then they say it costs 800 bucks to build. Then it's going to be either or with the HD DVD or BluRay. Now they announce this dumb thing called WA!PS3, which is sorta like XBox Live, but only for downloads. It's not online multiplayer, it's a software store accessible by console. Big whoop. I mean, XBox Live for 360 is already there. If you just look at the [PS3Today website](http://www.ps3today.com/), it's bad news after bad news. God of War 2 won't be built for the PS3 but for the PS2 in '07. Yike.

Now this is my year for Hi Def. And the more people I talk to, the more they say forget Sony for flat screens. I've heard they don't even make plasma TVs any longer after getting their asses handed to them by Pioneer and Panasonic. That's a damnable shame. Sony used to be somebody. But you know who *is* somebody? Apple.

Let me take you back briefly to what used to be one of the coolest places on earth. It was the Metreon in San Francisco. Back in 1999 and 2000 in the middle of irrational exuberance, every high tech Stanford Mafia don worth his VC connections could be seen eating sushi in this joint. IBM announced their whole e-business strategy there. XPlay back when it was called something else and it was only Adam Sessler, had every other episode shot there. When the PS2 premiered, it was at the Metreon that the camera crews watched the midnight lines. And smack dab in the middle of the Metreon was Sony Style, the coolest thing since Starbucks.

Fast forward to now. Sony puts rootkits on CDs, fueling rage, hatred and alienation among former devotees. The Minidisc never goes anywhere and the usage of DATs is considered selling out in the underground of hiphop. Nobody can pronounce VAIO and nobody really wants VAIO laptops any longer. They're overpriced and they break. Sony is so over.

Apple has done what nobody thought could be done, which is they have a killer product in consumer electronics. Yes the iPod is bigger than the Walkman. The company which spawned the Walkman is on the outs and the Apple Store is cooler than Sony Style ever was, if for only one reason. Sony Style thought they were so cool (and they were for a minute) that they had armed guards walking around rousting people who weren't buying. The Apple Store allows you to rent a Genius, which sounds snooty - you have to have an appointment, but actually works out nicely.

So here's to the hope that Apple does in the next 10 years what Sony did after their Walkman success, become bigger in consumer electronics. They're the only American company with the cachet. One word of warning however Apple. Don't try gaming.

### [Finally, a Plausible 360 Excuse](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/02/finally_a_plaus.html)

[Dean Takahashi](http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2006/02/memory_chips_ar.html) finally comes with the hardline.

> One of two companies supplying the Xbox 360's storage memory chips, Infineon, has had trouble making enough of the chips at the right speed for the game console that debuted last November, according to the sources. As a result Microsoft has not been able to meet the demand for the console.

...

> Specifically, the sources say Infineon wasn't able to make enough GDDR3 (graphics double data rate) memory chips for the Xbox 360. Each box has 512 megabytes of GDDR3 that stores a game's data. Both Infineon and Samsung supply GDDR3 chips to Microsoft.
> 
> Some Infineon chips ran slower than 700-megahertz speed that was required, according to the sources. This was a big problem because the Xbox 360 has only a single highway (dubbed unified memory architecture) connecting memory with two processors, the graphics chip and microprocessor. When either of those chips can't access memory as needed because of the slow memory chips, then the processing within the entire system bogs down.
> 
> As a result, Microsoft has had to start sorting the slow GDDR3 chips from the fast ones, adding a delay to the production of the boxes and limiting the total numbers it can build.

I think that if we would have been told this a while ago, we (meaning techie folks) might have pointed a bigger finger at MSFT for backing away from IBM. It was hard for me to believe that Flextronics and Wistron would both have serious problems meeting demand.

Bottom line, all of these demand planning excuses were a smokescreen to cover Infineon's ass.

### [The Predictability of the Future of Gaming](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/01/the_predictabil.html)

According to a [few (hardly) pregnant paragraphs](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7821), the future of gaming is bleak.

> Pachter expressed doubts that the Xbox 360 could make up for a deficit in the six-month sales total equivalent to 2005's. "We think that it is important to note that total U.S. console and handheld software sales over the first six months of 2005 were approximately $2.36 billion; the current rate of next generation software sales implies that Xbox 360 software will total less than 20% of this level over the next six months, indicating the potential for year-over-year sales declines for the foreseeable future."

I'm really trying to understand what this guy is comparing gaming sales to. Perhaps the best comparison is to microwave ovens. My original XBox lasted about 3 years before it came apart. So I think that qualifies, at an initial price of about 200 bucks, as durable goods. The 360 is double that price, so it makes a lot of sense, in terms of cannibalization, that they're not going to duplicate the sales figures.

As it stands, you can't go buy a 360 right yet. So this lack of availability is a real skew to what the market ought to be like. But here's where I really have difficulty with the basis of this prediction. This industry is capable of doing some remarkable things in terms of generating excitement in the market. Recall the scandals around San Andreas. You also, in some parallel to the movie industry, have fans who wait years for the content to come out. This is not like iPods, it's a very different dynamic. So if this guy sees year over year declines in the offing, I think he has no clue what he's talking about. There's a huge future out there for MMPORGs and PC crossover with the USB XBox Controller. It only gets bigger from here.

### [Going To Ravenholm](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2006/01/going_to_ravenh.html)

This holiday I have discovered why gamers have been raving over Half Life 2. It's a brilliant game. It's creepy. It's way interactive. It's puzzling and inventive. It's got a compelling storyline (so far) and it's got the best zombies ever. As a single player game, it's probably one of the all-time greats.

Now this is not news for most PC gamers, but this one has got me, a console gamer pretty excited. I cannot say with any surety that as a single player game I like it more than Halo2 but I understand how Halo's hype plays into the excitement of that game. I don't particularly like switching out characters so while that was an inventive part of Halo2, I find that it reduces rather than adds to the replayability for me, although it probalby make the game overall more exciting. However the puzzles on Half Life add some real spice to an action shooter, whereas Halo puzzles are just mazes.

I'm about 6 hours of play into this game, I guess, and what I estimate is about halfway through Ravenholm, which is by far the creepiest joint this side of Silent Hill. The

The navigation is pretty good and very consistent. It's not as smooth and realistic as Splinter Cell or any of the Tom Clancy shooters. In fact that I can't see my character in any way is something of a weird feeling to get used to. I see no hands when climbing ladders or swimming, and the reticle action on this game is pretty low. However the shooting action is first rate. Sound effects are top notch.

What makes this game world class are the graphics. The environments put together in Half Life 2 are absolutely superb. They have captured the industrial wasteland like no other game. There are only two that come close in showing this level and scale of depressing rust, one is Brute Force, the other is Chronicles of Riddick. There actually is one other that has this level of puzzles and inventive environments which was PsyOps: The Mindgate Conspiracy. But that game was so much fun and your character had so many different powers that you never feel quite as vulnerable as you do in Half Life 2.

Half Life has got great geek appeal. As much as I game, I am still surprised by the goodies I get in this shooter. So add me to the chorus of ravers for the Gravity Gun. Holy smokes is that a nice one. The indestructable sawblades are just splatterific. Launching one of those babies through a crowd of zombies is one of the unique experiences in all of violent gaming. The airboat with the gattling gun is also a very inventive piece of gaming. Nowhere under any circumstances have I face a more deadly helicopter. That is one of the most relentless foes ever. I put it right up there with the UAVs in the latest Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid 2. I'm sure there are more interesting goodies to come.

So there it is. I'll be in Ravenholm for a while.

### [360 Supply & Demand & More](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/12/360_supply_dema_1.html)

Well it's perfectly clear now. The 360 is a hit; way bigger than anybody suspected. So let's ask some stupid demand planning questions. Who screwed up in MSFT's manufacturing orders department? I mean they've got people saying stuff like this (as of 12/8):

> Market research firm, NPD Group, the top game-statistics firm in the industry issued its November report stating Microsoft sold 320,000 systems in the month of November. That’s roughly 80,000 shy of the company’s 400,000 expected units.

That makes no sense at all. Are they sold out? Yes. Are they not selling enough? Yes. Did they miss their target Yes? Anyway, selling more than a quarter of a million per month of anything that retails for 300-400 bucks is a pretty hefty cashflow. So get it right already guys. You have no excuses. Well. They do, and it [sounds like this](http://www.johnporcaro.com/2005/12/wearing_your_ze.html):

> "...I'd hate to be in the marketing department at Xbox. It's a no-win situation. If I were a marketing dude (and I'm surrounded by them every day), then every red blood cell in my body would be selling this amazing new thing called the Xbox 360. We're not talking about a Cuisenart here. This is a high-definition, next generation gaming experience. I'd be shouting from the rooftops. Except... the core audience (read: pre-sold audience) for this product is having difficulty getting their hands on one. And the more I shout about it, the more gamers (and the general public) becomes bitter about the "shortage." So instead of using my marketing degree, I've got to bite my tongue until January, or even February - when supply starts meeting demand again. Except that I don't have a marketing degree, and I don't work at Microsoft, or at Xbox

I don't think I'd mind being that guy.. except the profile picture on his blog is too small. In fact, I think the profile pictures on most people's blogs are too small.

Anyway, I've had a serving of Halo2 over the weekend and I'm getting re-hooked into the gaming - stuff I haven't done in a while. I don't feel left out of the early adopter stuff since not even Wal-Mart has any 360s on hand, and I can basically wait until January or so. The fact that I can play my favorite games on the 360, except for Splinter Cell (grr), is the best news.

It turns out that there are a few bloggers who have come out as gamers. Or rather I should say more m'softies who blog as well as game. That's good news, so I'll be linking to them from time to time. At the top of the Gamer Pile would be [Major Nelson](http://www.majornelson.com/).

Here are some I find intersting:  

> - [Grumpy Gamer](http://grumpygamer.com/)  
>     
> - [Thinking With My Fingers](https://torillsin.blogspot.com/)  
>     
> - [XBox (official, boring) Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/xbox/default.aspx)  
>     
> - [Joystiq (of course)](http://www.joystiq.com/)

[Scoble has the best dialog](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/23/microsoft-on-purpose-holding-xbox-supplies-back/) on the supply and demand issue. I can't find where the discussion is anywhere that says Flextronics is still making them. I know I read it. Even Google Desktop missed it.

BTW Joystiq has a [fascinating little reminder](http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000603066725/) that not too many years ago, the very thought of Microsoft being a leader in gaming was unthinkable. I know I killed that thought, as I pounded away on my Sega Saturn with the home version of Virtua Fighter.

Oh and one more thing. The French have made [Halo 0](http://www.halozero.new.fr/). A 2d side-scrolling shooter. Hee Haw!

Wait Wait There's More!  
I cannot prove it, but I swear to God that somewhere I wrote that the thing to do in the next Splinter Cell was to let Sam Fisher go undercover. It turns out that I was prophetic. That's exactly what they're doing in [Splinter Cell Four](http://xbox360.joystiq.com/entry/1234000220072186/).

### [True Crime: Streets of New York](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/11/true_crime_stre_1.html)

I wanted to like this. What a stunningly huge disappointment.

The original was a fun game marred by poor control of fighting. This one seems even worse. The whole thrill of walking through New York is destroyed by and incredibly monotonous stream of repeated invectives. You walk up the sidewalk and all you hear is 'What the hell?' and 'Oh shit!'. I kid you not. They've added rain, big deal. This one is horrible.

BUT. I'm going to keep it for another few days just to see if there are any goodies worth waiting for. The game is still a great idea with a very cool soundtrack. Couldn't they just sell the franchise to the GTA guys? At least that way it will get done right. I'd much rather be the cop than the thug, but I have to tell you - if you compare the two games, it's a whole lot more enjoyable being the thug in San Andreas than the cop in New York City.

### [Zero Hour](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/11/zero_hour_1.html)

The verdict is in, at least among the clan I've been hanging out with. Get the XBox 360. Now that Zero Hour has arrived, I'm going down to the local EBGames and see if I can get this controller to fit in my hands. All my friends are doing it.

Stay tuned.

### [3/6th T](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/11/36th_t_1.html)

I think it's the new Beemer that has effed up my attitude, but I have to say that I'll probably join the ranks of the multitudes of the unwashed who are going to hold off on XBox 360 for a while. I want to play the new Project Gotham as much as anybody. In fact, I'm going to message Black Ricco tonight and find out what's up with the other Oops Clan Gamers that I've been ignoring for months (I hope they let me back in), and see if he's rushing out to get one. Somehow I doubt it. I just emailed Lethalme to see what his attitude is about the new set.

I've been [disappointed with the 360 since day one](http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/003827.html). I'm one of the folks who doesn't think it's a good idea to have a big piece of sculpture in the living room. Me, I'd just like another blackface rack mountable component for the rack. They could have made the faceplate translucent with crazy lights, but no.. they have this cream colored hourglass monstrosity.

I've also got my paws trained for the Duke controller. I have a feeling it's going to be a long time before I cotton up to the new one. I do like the idea that they will be able to map it into PC games so that's a big plus, but I'm not sure that it will overcome the minus of it being made for pint-sized mitts.

So I'm basically half-enthused about this goody, which aint hardly enough to get off the 4 bills to replace my perfectly acceptable XBox. In fact, I just ran through [Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory](http://www.splintercell.com/us/) once again for the fun of it, and I'll probably do it again. That's a game.

See I like the idea of HiDef gaming a whole lot, but I'm not going to start doing it until I actually have the HiDef TV, so it's pointless for me to get this console without the new bigscreen, and that's a tall order at this particular moment. So I'm going to chill and listen to the hype and believe it, but I ain't spending the ducats any time soon. Same thing [Gamecrapper says](http://www.gamecrapper.com/?p=17).

What's fascinating is that, yeah I'm sure everybody knows that the platform is all that, but nobody's going to get off the bills until Halo 3 comes out, next year probably around the same time as the movie. [The release of Halo2](http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/002933.html) was the biggest event in gaming, well that and Half-Life 2. It's all about the games, guys.

### [Forza Motorsport](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/07/forza_motorspor_1.html)

It has been a while since I've been XBoxing, but finally Gamefly has delivered Forza Motorsport and I'm into it again.

I haven't had any occasion since old box broke to go online. That was primarily because of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, which had me very intently doing the single player thing. After that KOTOR 2 took up my time, but then I got weary of it. So my old buds in Black Ricco's lobby on PGR and other shooting clans had missed me. The other night for the first time in months, I caught up to them on Forza.

When I say I caught up to them, that only means in the lobby. On the track they dusted me. Forza is very challenging as a driving game and after about 10 hours I am just getting the hook. I just passed level 10 and I own about 5 cars and now it's starting to get interesting.

The controller layout on FM is just like that in Project Gotham Racing 2, so that gave me a bit of a headstart in getting on the road quickly. The interface is a lot like Rallisport Challenge in the way that cars and tracks are selected. But Forza is clearly its own game.

The driving experience is a lot more realistic and there are a great deal more subtleties in handling. But it doesn't make you feel like a complete dweeb. None of these cars, even the supercars seem super. They're all fallible and the differences between them

Nurburgring is better on Forza than PGR2.

### [San Andreas](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/06/san_andreas_1.html)

I'm not much of a gangbanger, but I'm trying to get better.

The first thing that strikes you about playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is that it's hard and you better get with it. The game is an order of magnitude more interesting than its predecessor for several reasons that are apparent within the first hour of gameplay.

Firstly, they're out to get you. In GTA Vice City, you basically walked around as a badass looking for trouble to get into. It required you to have an positive attitude towards mayhem and corruption. It was all about becoming a dangerous bigshot. In San Andreas, the moment you show up on the scene, you need to watch your back. Cops are out to get you, rival gangs are out to get you. You are broke and bony and your mama has been shot dead, you have no respect and people who walk by are constantly reminding you how badly you stink.

Secondly, the music is bomb quality. There are several soundtracks to choose from as you cruise around in stolen cars. The folks at Rockstar have pulled off a licensing coup. These aren't just rehacked samples, there are real songs by real groups you know - Rage Against the Machine, Stone Temple Pilots, Rick James, Isley Brothers, Cameo, Roger & Zapp. Even the soft music and country music is real.

Living as CJ puts you into a number of knuckle dragging situations. You beat down busters for fastfood money. Life is cheap. You generally get maybe 15 dollars for braining somebody with the various melee weapons you find in alleys and under underpasses, or on unconscious bodies.

I'm about three hours into the game and I've probably killed 15 civilians 3 cops and 25 rival bangers. I've got a couple cool tatoos and I've stolen every kind of car in the game, including a Bentley, several motorcycles and a police SUV. I've tagged half a dozen buildings, done several drive-bys and dented so many cars and pedestrians that I can't keep count. It's not fun. All I care about is getting respect from my homies. I want to beat the game, and I use the tools that the environment provides.

San Andreas feels very clunky as a shooter and it's much easier to get sent to the hospital in this game than any other violent videogame I've played. I swear I felt a great deal safer commanding commandos in terrorist territory. So there is never a real sense of confidence one gets in the San Andreas mayhem. The easiest thing to do is jack civilians while they're eating at Cluckin' Bell. I've come to resent the busta civilians; they just walk aimlessly through the 'hoods of San Andreas without the need for respect and without a bounty on their head.

How accurate this portayal of gang life is, depends on people like DJ Pooh in the credits, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that it is a lot more compelling as a game than I imagined it could be, although it's hardly the guilty pleasure of True Crime. It's more akin to Silent Hill. You're in something of a horror movie and you have to see how it ends.

### [Advent Rising](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/06/advent_rising_1.html)

I picked up Advent Rising from the Blockbuster rather than waiting for Gamefly. It's a fabulous game, but M11 likes it much more than I. The concept is great, no doubt because of the influence of **Orson Scott Card**. But what strikes me about this game is that it is clearly a genre breaker. It has every intention of being its own movie, and I very much like the direction that takes.

Advent Rising, in aiming to be its own cinematic experience sets a new high for scope, just short of Halo, but something of a new low for gameplay. For me the battle action was just too sloppy and fast. It felt like Unreal but less precise. Unreal is already too fast for me, not that I don't like fast action, I just don't dig the physics. It's simply unreal, blurry, jaggy - the edges don't meet.

There's one thing that is astoundingly cool about Advent Rising is that it gives your fighter a lot more power than any avatar usually gets, and in this I find the greatest possibilities. Most games until this point make you slave very hard to get your powers, and the best of them like KOTOR or [Fable](http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/002923.html), make results strategic. The best multi-forker in that way was the LA street cop game [True Crime: Streets of LA](http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/001081.html). But like most video games, you are all too human. In AR, you very quickly get to superhuman skills, ala [Psy Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy](http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/psiops/readers.html) another great favorite of mine. (I'm surprised that I hadn't already written a review of Psy Ops, and I certainly hope to be that character in a sequel.) And although AR gives no indication that it will do any forking based upon choices between good and evil, it's just the kind of mix of action, role-playing and strategy that hopefully will arise in the next generation of games.

Right now Psy Ops has the best chance of taking our hero off-world to battle greater forces. Here's the great fork. Allow your guy to rampage or crusade to a level where he's got country capturing skills. Instead of just defending an oil refinery from terrorists, let our guy vaporize one with mind powers and plunge a nation into chaos. He walks among the streets, impervious with an edict to 'take me to your leader' whom he crushes instantly. He directs epic battles from the front and conquers the globe. Just as soon as world domination is his and he gets the ultimate power, aliens drop in and exile him to another planet on the far side of the galaxy. Now he has to start over, a planet at a time. This is more on the KOTOR scale, and I haven't gotten far enough into KOTOR II to see if this is the arc - but I basically don't want to have to deal with Pazaak, see?

Anyway, Advent Rising has already announced itself as a trilogy, and the guy behind the effort has already said it is the 'least awesome' of his many ideas. Bears waiting for. Meanwhile, I gotta turn it in today - not worth the late fees.

### [Gamey Weekend Stuff](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/06/gamey_weekend_s_1.html)

**Sudoku**  
OK I'm hooked. But at least I can pretend that it's educational. 2/3rds of my kids are somewhat hooked too. What a fabulous game. It's something that was designed with geeks like me in mind. You see it's a perfect seed for cyphers. Sorta.  
**  
Advent Rising**  
OK so it's full of glitches and the speed is unnatural. It is imaginitive and Halo-like in it's immersion. For a third person shooter, I much prefer the action of Brute Force, but hey, it's Orson Scott Card and it takes itself seriously as a cinematic experience. I haven't been bored yet, although I'm only an hour into it. I still wish it didn't have boss battles. How tired is that?

### [KOTOR Again](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/06/kotor_again_1.html)

Once again I have jumped off the high dive of Star Wars myth and legend thanks to XBox and Lucas Arts. I have assumed the person of Fargo Tazmin and am fighting mining droids in the Paragen asteroid belt. Trying to find my way off that rock without being a total butthead so that I can get light side bonus points is a bit more time consuming than I expected. But it's better than dropping quarters in an arcade.

Unfortunately the XBox is literally on it's last legs. I don't think I'm going to make it to Christmas and the Xbox 360 release. It has been about three months since the green light blew out, and the disk chugs like a old cement mixer. Last night it spontaneously turned itself off a couple times. I've got a bad feeling about this.

### [E3](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/05/e3_1.html)

The Playstation 3 is way more beautiful than the the XBox 360. I say this as a diehard XBoxer. It's not a pity, because I love my XBox now and it's ugly as dirt. Still you have to give MS a little credit for making their new box look like a large iPod, sorta. But Sony has done the right thing and gave us a swoopy burnished machine in three different finishes. Nicely.

I'm following the E3 happenings on the [GamesBlog](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/). So far so so. I live in LA but haven't had a moment's rest, so I haven't been able to cruise the bars near the Convention Center and catch some drippings. I can't say that I'm really that excited anyway. It turns out that we've got THQ and Activision as customers. I heard EA uses our stuff too, so sooner or later I'll get out to see these guys, LA being the headquarters for all things gamey.

In the meantime, I haven't been on Live for months and am still enjoying the heck out of being [Sam Fisher](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/tomclancysplintercell/default.htm).

![x360.jpg](http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/x360.jpg)

This is what the rumors say the new XBox 360 is supposed to look like. There's a rather [amazing discussion](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000293041091/#comments) about whether or not it's fake or just photoshopped to look good, or photoshopped to look fake or photoshopped to look photoshopped. It's an interesting conundrum for disinformationists like me. Either way it keeps all the fanboys guessing and the industry astir.

I think it looks stupid. I like the color but I'd much rather have something with a 19 inch low profile kind of thing that fits in with the rest of my home theatre electronics. The new XBox should look like a sweet 1U rackmount server with some iridescence on the faceplate. That thing looks like somebody stepped on an iPod. It's a hideous looking mess and all the proportions are wrong. I did a Malcolm Gladwell blink on it and I say it's very fake. If it's real, it's real ugly. Fix it.

I've never played Legend of Zelda and I've always thought that Mario was a dweeb in every way. In fact, the only thing Nintendo ever did for me was in the arcade. You know, arcade? That place you had to go to and put quarters in the machines?

Quite frankly I couldn't really tell you which of any of the arcade games I liked were made my Nintendo. Maybe Donkey Kong, but I played it more than I liked it. Clearly none of the games I did like wound up impressing young musicians like this dude, [The Video Game Pianist](http://www.videogamepianist.com/index_files/audio.htm).

Yes I do believe it's art. I just don't recognize it. Oh except for that little thing by Liszt, the Transcendental Etude #10. That's actually one of my all time favorites.

### [Xenon This Year](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2005/02/xenon_this_year_1.html)

I've cranked up my gaming a bit this past week. For two weeks I didn't even touch Halo. Now I'm coming back around to it and I can see that the new skills I picked up from the Unofficial Battle Guide are becoming more smoothly integrated into my playing style. I'm winning more frequently, and still finding new routes and tactics. Man this is a rich game.

But I don't know what Microsoft is thinking in releasing the next box in October. Halo2 would have been out less than a year, and it's going to chill the market from now until then. I'm telling my boy only to get old games we used to rent. So from here on out, no new games. Unless maybe HalfLife comes out on the platform.

In any case it seems to be a done deal and the beginning of the hype starts now.

They've got to do a removable storage thing, and have some security feature so that you can copy games onto the [removeable] disk. I'm getting rather tired of the performance of some of my older games. That would be killer. I suppose some form of HD would be nice, but I really don't see how the graphics could be improved. In short, from my perspective, everything on XBox2 would be gravy, and that means they are going to have to do some convincing to get me to upgrade.

After October, the original XBox is going to start to look like a real bargain. As it stands there are a lot of good, cheap games out there to be had, like PsyOps, a real sleeper. BTW, Is Yu Suzuki on board?

In addition to the [GamertagDatabase](http://www.gamertagdatabase.com/), I have signed up to [Defas](http://halo.defas.org/). Their ideas about global stats are right on time, right on target and soon, right up my alley.  

> The question must be asked. Why don’t more game developers reap the benefits of this technology? A step in the right direction of tapping into the full potentiality of the Xbox Live is proliferating community developers with the tools they need. Bridging the aftermarket gap by honoring community conduits as such increases product awareness. If that’s not enough, appeasing any percentile of your fan-base is a good thing. The opportunity here for communal growth is astonishing, and the interest ridiculously prevailing.

Their stats are fairly cool. I dig it.

### [Massive Shooters & Adhoc Clans](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/12/massive_shooter.html)

[CNET reports](http://news.com.com/%27CounterStrike%27+session+sets+record/2110-1043_3-5473464.html?tag=st_lh) that a record of sorts has been set for hosting simultaneous online gamers.  

> Hardware maker Unisys announced Wednesday that its ES7000 server helped set a record for the most online game players ever hosted on a single server. The feat occurred last June at DreamHack 2004, a major computer conference in Sweden.
> 
> Game enthusiasts at the conference set up a session of the popular shooting game "CounterStrike" with 1,160 simultaneous players hosted on a single Unisys server, equipped with 32 Intel Xeon 2.2GHz processors and 32GB of memory. The Guinness World of Records recognized the session as a world record earlier this week.

So let me see if I understand this correctly. There were over 1100 gamers playing at once?

If this is correct, then it opens up the possibility of huge games. Now I don't play MMORPGs like Everquest, but I have been There and on Second Life. So it's possible that this kind of stuff could actually happen. But in shooters, there is so much more going on in realtime than just chat and dance moves.

Halo2's 'proximity' feature is particularly notable in this regard. They have already breached the barrier of having what goes on around a player in more focus than what's going on in the background. I can see the game glitch occasionally enough to see objects I move towards get less jaggy. So I know that they have mastered the first person experience with regard to prioritizing events close up and deprioritizing remote ones. So this suggests to me that a 'Halo 3' could do some rather intersting things. Let's speculate.

If the user experience of the game is prioritized by proximity it means that the immediate environment 'renders itself' around the player - it's work that is piped to the client by the server given a 'gps location'. This means that there's a kind of limit to what you need to know as if you were in a Newtonian field of an Einsteinian universe. In otherwords, your playing field can be massive beyond comprehension but all you know, or need to know, you can handle with your own little compute box. A massive server however can keep track of global Einsteinian events. So where are we headed? We're headed towards shooters that have battles which last longer than individual gamer and clan sessions.

Right now the greatest thing about Halo2 is its ability to deliver the cool guts of shooting action to an individual gamer by matching them up relatively quickly with people who want to do the same thing. This is very important and I'll talk about it more later. But the fact that the Bungie folks understand this key feature menas that they will be open to the idea of adhoc clans.

So in a massive shooter served by a massive box, you can be delivered to a battlefield, get orders, and try to take positions in a battle that was going on before your arrived. Here is the nature of an adhoc clan. Halo3 could have waves of Earth fighters engage city after city in the Covenant planets. Battles that last for days can be engaged...

### [Beyond Halo 2](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/11/beyond_halo_2.html)

I finally finished the Halo single player campaign. It was a blast. Like a lot of folks, I was fairly perplexed by the ending. The cinematics in this one were insufficient, by my reckoning, to give me enough details to fill in plot holes. On the other hand, I was very interested to get to the next level, just fresh from the exhiliration of beating the last set of baddies down.

It's true that Halo2 is more expansive in every way than the first. I can see how Halo3 could be even greater. What seems to be the huge surprise, and I may be reading this wrong, is that Earth itself is the Arc, and the Prophet of Regret came to warn humans that the Covenant was on a course to glass it. The Arc, if I'm reading that correctly, is the place where all of the Halo rings can be remotely activated. If Earth is the Arc, then it alone is safe from the Halo weapon, and/or the Founders were the original Earth inhabitants and Humans are the decendants of the Founders. With these pieces, Halo now approaches a new level of sci-fi drama. Or as [this guy explains](http://forum.teamxbox.com/archive/index.php/t-308716.html):  

> the halos don't kill flood...they kill their only means to spread which is all sentient life (meaning everyone else)...the halos were created to contain the flood, so when the rings were activated, they were already quarantined inside the rings, which is why they were able to survive.
> 
> The "Ark", which in Biblical terminology, is a safe haven for remaining life (eg. Noah's Ark contained animals, humans, etc, that were to be "saved" from utter destruction (the Great Flood).). So the theory about the humans actually being decendants of the Forerunner are actually likely. This would explain why Regret's fleet only had few Covenant warships (which if they had more could have easily obliterated Earth's defenses) at the start of the game, because he didn't know that humans were on the "Ark".
> 
> Earth contains the key to activate all of the Halos, as stated by 343 at the end of the game. If you all remember, at the Halo2.com site, when you point the cursor at the continent of Africa, it says "This is what we came for", which means the key is in Africa. This explains why the only place you get to fight on Earth as MC is Old and New Mombasa (which are actual cities in Africa). This is why the Covenant did not fully glass Earth, as they did with Reach, because they need to get to the key and begin their "Great Journey" into godhood, which they believe the forerunners became after activating the rings (foolish bastards!)

Use him to help rally the covenant against the Prophets and help them to realize the truth of what the rings actually do (wipe out all life). This, consequently, i think will result in a truce/agreement between the Humans and Covenant converters to stop the flood and the religion of the false prophets.

The question is whether or not Ridley Scott believe so, because he is being pitched this movie like nobody's business. You just have to get the right writers interested in taking up subplots and complications on the various alien races of the Covenant and voila.

In the meantime, I've got my ranking up to 5 in the online game and can now concentrate on that exclusively.

### [Halo 2 Rules, Changes the Rules](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/11/halo_2_rules_ch.html)

Halo [grossed $125 million](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3136413) in its opening 3 days. Bigger than Spiderman2.  

>   
> Halo 2 sold through 2.4 million units in its first 24 hours of North American release, Microsoft announced today. That adds up to $125 million in gross receipts, giving Bungie's latest Xbox project a place in the record books for both games and the entertainment industry at large.
> 
> To pull a couple of examples from the movie business, the all-time record for a movie's opening weekend belongs to Spider-Man 2, which grossed almost $115 million. Pixar's The Incredibles, launched this past weekend, drew a $70 million gross in its first three days. Shrek 2 owns the record for the highest single-day gross, drawing $44 million on May 22, 2004.  

That's what I've been doing all day.

### [Halo 2: First Look](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/11/halo_2_first_lo.html)

I didn't think I'd be writing this early, but it turns out that I have a break at work. Yes, I'm at work.

I picked up my copy last night at EB Games in Torrance. I was 26th in a line of about 75. The headlines say that MS has already done 100 million worth of business. I have no doubts. I was going to wait actually, but last evening I saw my MS communicator show that a couple of my buddies were already online playing. I couldn't stand that kind of peer pressure. I felt midnight pass through the states like New Years Day.

I got back to the crib at 12:28am and popped the disk in calmly. I hate shrinkwrap like the next guy, but I wasn't going to do something stupid with my big knife. So I patiently created my profile, inverted my look and logged onto Live. As I expected, there were already people I knew online playing including eedad, my fearless clan leader. I decided to go the long way and start a new campaign offline.

The trailers pick up the story reasonably well. The head Covy is getting branded for goofing the Halo mission and the Master Chief is getting a medal for his participation in the same. We're in orbit. I basically played a couple deathmatches and CTF online for about half an hour last night and another 90 minutes or so to complete the first chapter last night and this morning.

The gameplay seems smoother and faster. I've been playing Black Arrow for the past few weeks and I can tell that my aim is a lot better than it has been. At Medium, the grunts and other aliens come and drop at a predictable pace. The opening is not quite as heartthumping as the first Halo but then again, I'm hardly the noob I was. I dual-weilded all the indoor battles and it's brilliant. With a couple of plasma rifles, the MC is about as deadly as any FPS character ever. It rather reminded me of Berserk mode in 'Brute Force', except that the two rifles fire independently. So you can go lefty or righty or both. It will take me a while to get used to the different combinations of dual-weilding, but it's really a great dimension to gameplay.

The headsup is disoriently different at first. It took me a long time to get used to looking for life bars in the bottom left instead of the top right. Also, in multiplayer I had voices coming out of the TV and the communicator. Furthermore you can really jump high in the new game. As I get used to these fundamental changes, Halo 2 should soon feel natural.

The AI is definitely improved. You can immediately see that when you get to do a little Warthogging. Let a Marine drive and ride shotgun. He'll drive you to the right places and with the gunner, get the job done even if you kick back and relax. I noticed a bit of a glitch in firing if the driver does a quick 180 - plasma goes in weird directions, and your range isn't that good, but shotty is good.

Recharging is quick. Not only your shields for the battle armor suit but for the big gun on the Scorpion. Spend all your time fighting and no time looking for health packs. Brilliant again.

### [Eleven Nine](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/11/eleven_nine.html)

Yes I stood outside at midnight like a kid. Yes Halo2 is better than the first in just about every way. It's faster. The weapons are cooler, the environments seem larger.

And yes I *am* going to work today.

### [The Vast Greatness of Gaming](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/11/the_vast_greatn.html)

I missed an opportunity to dignify my rantings through appeals to authority the other night. I was too busy drinking margaritas and consuming juicy steak with my wife and friends. So instead of being at Beckman Auditorium hearing:  

> Techno-cultural historian Steven Johnson is a contributing editor for Wired and Discovery magazines, and is the cofounder and editor-in-chief of FEED, the revolutionary Internet magazine that managed to blend technology, science, and culture. He is also the celebrated author of the award-winning books Interface Culture; Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities and Software; and, most recently, Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life.

I was just telling that story of Mandume, the Seville, and Jersey Highway Patrol again.

Be that as it may, I happen to think that this cat Johnson is onto something once again. I really dug his explanation of [emergent behavior](http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/001974.html). And I was pretty thrilled to hear him talk about what he has learned over the past few years about thought centers in the brain. Notably that you're **supposed** to use only 10% of your brain at a time. Why? Because the brain is a collection of specialized tools that have evolved to do different kinds of thinking. Basically take your left-brain / right-brain theory and break it down a couple dozen times and this is where cognitive theory is getting us. So the MRI of a guy solving crossword puzzles is different than the MRI of the same guy playing piano. Different mental task, different part of the brain.

As a reader of Oliver Sacks from way back in the day, such matters have always been of deep interest to me, and I'm definitely going to change the way I start thinking about how my kids brains are developing. Speaking of which, he said that we now know with a great deal more certainty that emotional states are deeply related to thoughts. A happy person remembers happy times. A sad person remembers sad times. Until you're happy, you forget your self-esteem and all the good things you did when you were you. Stuff like that. Anyway, that's just another big incentive to remind me not to make the kids cry when I correct their homework.

But Johnson's newest book is of a revolutionary piece. 'Everything Bad is Good For You' is due out this spring. He argues that television, movies and videogames are not the mind-rot they once were. In fact that they stimulate the mind in ways previously never considered. There are all kinds of tangents one can take with this, but it's something I understand. I long ago decided that it would be better for my kids play videogames than to watch television because of their interactivity. I expect Johnson to discover a nice set of concepts of mind-jigger that vids give us.

A simple example in obviousness might be the comparison between 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Wire'. In the old days, the plot basically focused on one caper with a small set of characters that was resolved in 30 minutes. A show like 'The Wire' mixes multiple clans of characters with clashing interests going in several directions at once. Watching shows like 'Gunsmoke' only required one glance to get in on the fun, but if you tuned to an episode of '24' in the middle of the season, there's no way your are going to be able to make sense of its complexity.

Online videogames, especially what [MMORPG](http://www.mmorpg.com/)s are morphing to, expand on this even further because behind each character is another human being, not a screenwriter. They are not simply games, they're economies. This is not your father's idiot box.

### [Finished Fable in Fifteen](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/11/finished_fable_.html)

Fable is nowhere near as big as Knights of the Old Republic. Its story is not as complex, its scope is smaller. But I'm ready to play it again from start to finish, and that's something I'd never say about an RPG of this sort.

I think that the authors of Fable have come up with a very happy medium, and that is because of the fighting system. I spent most of my time in Fable battling, sometimes with (dumb AI) allies but mostly singlehandly, and I enjoyed the hell out of it. I cannot think of any other fighting game I've ever played that allows such a wide arsenal of offensive and defensive weapons to be weilded in real time. The targeting is nice but not too easy, the spell gradations are very cool and the variety of enemies is really nice.

While it's true that the boss battles leave quite a bit to be desired as boss battles go, I don't particularly like boss battles, and so it suited me just fine. It took me three days to beat Bastila in KOTOR and I was really about to give up completely. When it came to fighting the last boss, I just said forget it. It wasn't worth a one minute cut scene after having played the game for weeks. But I think the folks at Lionhead understand that even in a great fighting game, it's a lot more fun to hack and slash legions of enemies than to conquer big monsters.

I went pretty much straight for legendary good-guy status and spent almost no time interacting with anyone who wasn't directly involved in my quests. I think part of that has to do with the fact that it's far easier to select and emply use a variety of weapons than it is to use the variety of expressions. I am at a loss to explain why it was so easy to map the skills onto my right thumb but the left d-pad was a monstrosity of cascading menus. If I wanted to laugh or belch in someone's face, they will have walked halfway across town before I could engage them, but in a second, I could slow time, zoom through them, summon a creature, make myself berserk and triple club them with a flame augmented obsidian greathammer. Then again, I can belch at people in real life.

I cannot describe how delicious it is to have this array of weapons and spells at your disposal. But playing them has left several other dimensions that the game has completely unexplored. I'm going to explore them while I patiently wait for Amazon to deliver Halo2 to my doorstep.

### [In The Can](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/10/in_the_can.html)

Halo2 has gone gold. This is the software industry term for the Hollywood term 'in the can'. Which means the master is complete and off to manufacture. Which means somewhere on the planet, there is already a bootleg version. It doesn't matter because the game is priced right and the consumer feels adequately served by a $50 videogame that will play for months. I've already pre-ordered my copy. The countdown continues.

This is a much better deal than a first run movie for example. If I pay 8 bucks for 90 minutes, that's about a buck for every 10 minutes. If the original Halo cost that much, it would have cost someone like me hundreds of dollars considering the time I spent in that game. I know that I've played PGR2 at least 150 hours the last time I checked, which was several months ago.

I've been playing Burnout3 for a little while and I'm already burned out on it. It's a lot of fun but lacks the control I prefer. The crashes are perfect and so are the games, although I'd rather have a first person view I could switch to (I always drive first person). Nascar is in the mail. It should be good.

25 days to zero.

### [Halo2 Making Epic Strides](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/10/halo2_making_ep.html)

OK I have to admit that I'm a sucker for a new sense of things right about now. I'm dropping the sensitivity screens in order to develop a vocabulary for things **hot**. In my new role as CTO for a very, very cool web venture coming up I'm courting an interesting audience not too far off from where I was 10 - 15 years ago.

What has this got to do with Halo2? Well it turns out that Bungie has hooked up with Nile Rodgers (yes that Nile Rodgers) to produce the music for the Halo2 soundtrack. The first single is by a group called 'Breaking Benjamin' which sounds like a grown-up Blink 182 Linkin Park with a touch of Korn. It's called 'Blow Me Away' and it is _slammin'_. It's... (hmm how do the young people say it these days?) The lead singer has a touch of that Matchbox 20 guy and the guitars have a touch of the STP when they go epic. This is damned good music for a video game. It's actually damned good music, period.

I am starting to get the feeling that what we're going to be hearing a lot after the release of H2, is that video games are turning the corner into real cross-media starmakers. I've been playing Burnout 3 so I know how EA has been dropping little rock tracks into their cut screens, but that's kind of disposable stuff. As anyone who has played Halo knows, O'Donnell and Salvatori's music is outstanding. Now it rocks and a lot of people are going to be paying attention.

I'm just listening to the [streaming version available here](https://www.sumthing.com/), and I've played it 8 times just writing this piece. It's that good.

Do you know what November 9, 2004 is?

It is the debut of the most eagerly anticipated game in the history of gaming: Halo 2. This past week the [Beta of the game completed](http://xbox.ign.com/articles/546/546627p1.html). All the news is awesome. New weapons, new vehicles, new capabilities.

We have predicted that grades and productivity will drop all over the nation, as gamers get immersed in Halo2.

### [The Dynamics of Spawn Camping](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/08/the_dynamics_of.html)

The most happening game on XBox Live these days is the latest installment of [Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six](http://www.rainbowsix3.com/us/), known as [Black Arrow](http://www.ubi.com/US/Games/blackarrow_xbx.htm).

I started playing Black Arrow last week. For those of you unfamiliar with the series, it's basically the most popular combat simulator online. If you have absolutely no interest in squad-based first person shooters, this may seem tedious but it's actually rather interesting, especially if you worry about how the socialization of your sons is progressing. If you have no son, it's still a fascinating foray into game theory.

**XBox Live**  
What goes on here? Well, it works a little something like this. Your son has his XBox hooked up to a large anonymous network of several thousands of others people's sons. He drops in a game disc, which is essentially a $50 DVD that almost nobody tries to bootleg, and all the other gamers that are online at the same time appear. Now your son has a list of 40 or 50 (up to a hundred) other gamers on his 'friends list'. Most of these friends will be people he has, and will never meet in person. They could be from Alabama, Alberta or Allemagne. He just knows them by their 'gamertag', their alias, and perhaps by their voice if they've played enough. Voice? Yes, that's what that silly Bobby Brown My Prerogative headset is for. He can hear what all the other players in his room are saying, and of course he can talk back to them.

For generations people have been shouting back at sports players on the television. Your son may be stupid, but at least he knows that the people on the other side of the screen can actually hear him.

**The Room**  
So boy turns on the game, enters a PIN through his handheld controller and now there are several thousand other gamers playing Black Arrow with which he may cooperate or compete. He chooses which kind of game he wants to play, say 'Total Conquest' (that would be compete via cooperation), and all of the hosts who are hosting that kind of game show up on the screen after a quick search. Not their faces, just their gamertags in a list. He can then enter any hosted game of any particular host and get started gaming. He can't start playing a game until he gets into a room. No matter what time of day or night, there's always a room with plenty of English speakers.

**The Host**  
I mentioned hosting a room. Who is a host? Anybody who wants to be a host is a host. Your son might be a host. Maybe he's even a good host. So there is a choice your son makes. Maybe he wants to host a room, maybe he wants to join somebody else's room, maybe he wants to join a room wherever his friends are. Let's say he chooses to be a host and serve up his own room. He then configures up his room depending on how he wants to play. He will allow 16 people to play, two opposing teams of 8 each. He will allow friendly fire and he will ban grenade launchers. The game will be Total Conquest.

**The Clan**  
In addition to having a large set of friends which are visible across games other than Black Arrow. You may join an identifyable clan within the context of the Black Arrow world. These clans can arrange to compete exclusively against each other in tournaments, but most of the action has unaffiliated individuals mixed with clanners.

**Ready Up**  
One more thing. Your son and everyone on his squad has to decide which [compliment of weapons](http://www.neoseeker.com/resourcelink.html?rlid=83614&rid=77607) they are going to employ. They do this in the lobby before the game starts. There are assault rifles, chain guns, pistols, sniper rifles and a variety of explosives. Take your pick.

### [Juinor Modders](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/07/juinor_modders.html)

In Project Gotham Racing 2, I am ranked 4999th in the world, or at least I was at 3:30 this morning when I signed off. That's not bad out of 224k people who race this online game. I've been around the block a few times, but last night I saw something I never saw before. Upon reflection it doesn't seem to be much, but I was very impressed at the time.

Just like in the Matrix, everything about these simulated worlds are driven by rules. Sometimes there are gaps or glitches in the rules which allow the observant and persistent to bend them. For the most part however, most people play the game and enjoy themselves within the constraints of the playing field.

Last night, a modder went 450 miles per hour. This is the equivalent of Neo flying in the Matrix.

A modder is someone who takes apart a digital appliance and modifies the hardware or software to add features to an ordinary game. This is very much like the aftermarket for cars, except it's [chips](http://system-mods.com/index2.php). By doing so, a modder can bend or break rules or even add their own.

In PGR2 there are a collection of about 100 automobiles for racing, each with its own speed, colors and handling characteristics. In the original version, which has twice been updated by the manufacturer with expansion packs. A well known, and perhaps the only flaw in the game was known as the 'Color Glitch'. Through a series of button clicks on the XBox controller, a player could change the colors of a car. This was notably done on the Porsche GT1, one of the most desirable cars in the game which was only available in white. Players who mastered the Color Glitch would appear at the start of a race with orange or black GT1s, thus announcing their status to the rest of the players. As more people learned the Color Glitch, races would take forever to start as players would try to outdo each other by picking cool colors. That all stopped three months ago with the addition of the Paris Booster Pack which also patched the bug.

I was in the company of two young modders, a 19 year old kid from Philly and a 13 year old from somewhere in Canada. Philly did the hack. Canuck offered to set up a webcam session and show me how to mod my own XBox.

Stay Tuned.

_(full reprint)_  
[A PhD in Mortal Kombat](http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-ca-vidgames6jun06,0,7063029.story?coll=la-headlines-technology)  
By Mary McNamara  
Times Staff Writer

June 6, 2004

A pioneering USC group tries to get into the heads of players to learn if the pastime harms or can help.

  
Ever since they were children, Steve Choi, Ethan Levy and Elaine Chan have been told by people who never met them that the great passion of their lives, the thing that captivated and moved them, was the enemy of intellect, emotionally damaging and quite possibly the end of civilization as we know it.

Choi, Levy and Chan are gamers. That is, they play video games with serious devotion and intensity. They are also students at the University of Southern California — Choi and Levy, both 22, are entering their senior year, and Chan, 21, is working on her PhD. But far from merely overcoming their digital predilections to succeed in college, these three and others like them are using their knowledge of games like Mortal Kombat and the Sims to further their education. As members of USC's Computer Games project, they are the local vanguard of a new academic discipline: video game scholarship.

Choi recalls that his mother gave him a computer when he was 8 because she felt computer science was the career path of the future; she was, however, less then thrilled when her son began spending much of his on-screen time playing games.

"All our lives we've heard how terrible it is," Choi says. "I wanted to offer the other side of the question."

Created through the Annenberg School for Communication, the Annenberg Studies on Computer Games is a multidisciplinary, multigenerational, multilingual research group dedicated to the study of computer games. The year-old group is one of several game-related projects springing up at universities around the country. MIT, Stanford, the University of Michigan and Northwestern University have various projects researching different aspects of interactive media. But USC's computer games project is probably the largest and most diverse collection of professors and students studying the vast yet mysterious world of video games. The research at USC focuses on the gamer rather than game design or development, and much of what they are doing is groundbreaking.

The project is the creation of Peter Vorderer, who heads the school's entertainment studies program, and Ute Ritterfeld, a German research associate professor with a background in health sciences and psychology. "We are trying to find out not only what is bad but what is good," Ritterfeld says. "Every new technology is met with fear and criticism. When picture books first came out, people said they would ruin children's imaginations; with radio it was the same; movies, television the same. We are trying to find out what is real and what is just fear."

After years of snubbing video games as a phenomenon not worth researching, scholars are now frantically attempting to catch up with an interactive media industry that is increasingly prevalent, seemingly permanent and still so new that the people developing it are the ones who are using it.

Ritterfeld says the topic itself is polarizing. "The nongamers consistently criticize the games, the gamers defend them. They honestly can't imagine any harm in them. What's really needed is more research."

Chan knows what true gamers face — she spent one summer doing nothing but playing the online role-playing games she favors. Over the years, though, she has learned to keep her gaming habits to herself. "Whenever I mention that I'm sort of obsessed with video games everyone is shocked and horrified and asks, 'Well, how did you make it to USC?' " she says. "Even in the computer group," she adds with a laugh.

The 20-person USC group is an international lot, including members from Germany, China, Ukraine, India and Korea as well as all over the U.S. In the past years, it's developed or launched studies into areas as diverse as the effect of violent games on brain activity, the motivation of gamers, the benefits of interactive learning, and the role of narrative and character development in the games themselves.

While two of the studies will focus on the hot-button issue of violence, most are geared toward discovering what psychological needs the games fill and what role they can have in education and mass audience entertainment.

In one study planned for this summer, researchers will test the conventional wisdom that interactive learning is more productive than rote. "Everyone assumes children will learn more if they are playing a game," Ritterfeld says. "But we do not know that because it has never been tested."

Vorderer, who has edited several books on the psychology of entertainment, is already compiling a book about gaming, which he believes is changing not just the industry but the definition of entertainment.

"When we started, we thought, 'Well, games are cool and under-researched so this will be a good area,' " Vorderer said. "But the more work we do, it is so striking how everything is connected to games. The military, the movies, education, everyone is doing games."

### [Full Spectrum Warrior: First Look](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/06/full_spectrum_w.html)

As combat sims go, I have to say that this is the most realistic I've played. I think it's going to have a serious hold on me for some time to come.

I've only gotten through the basic training of Full Spectrum Warrior, something that took me the better part of 2 hours, and I am very impressed. The first thing I notice about this is that it doesn't give you a whole lot of fancy weaponry. It gives you soldiers. What's so incredibly cool about FSW is that it's not cool.

I've played Ghost Recon, its follow up Island Thunder, Rainbow Six 3 but this one is by far the most realistic. Although Splinter Cell comes close, I'm more dependent on info over the squawk in this game than any other. Whereas in Metal Gear, it gets downright annoying talking to Otacon, I really look forward to hearing Charlie 32. Second only FoeHammer, Charlie 32 is the best voice to hear.

On the last part of the MOUT, I encounter the tank. Hey, I can call in support! Gnarly! So I light up the tank and the mortars start dropping and the whole damn place is shaking. I'm a whole block away and it's still scary. Brings it home.

### [XBox Fantasy](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/06/xbox_fantasy.html)

The game world just gets better and better. This weekend I'm going to be immersed. Say bye bye family, daddy's going gaming. I've got four new titles to play with and it's going to rock.

**Riddick**  
This is a big surprise. I've only played a little bit but this is a really innovative game. It's one part Splinter Cell, one part Doom, one part Deus Ex. It's totally cool and confirms that Vin Diesel is going to be the next Bruce Willis. It's got the most fabulous use of shadows I've ever seen in a game. I'm going to have a lot of fun with this one. I thought the latest Hitman was too dark. This one seems to have struck the right balance.

**MX Unleashed.**  
OK this one is for the kids, but I had to try it. Not bad. Not quite as engaging as Moto GP or Rallisport Challenge, but not bad.

**Full Spectrum Warrior**  
I'm going to write a whole piece for this game. The greatest thing about it is that it's not cool.

**Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow**  
I turned this one in much too soon. Forget Blockbuster, this is on Gamefly now, so I'll keep it until I finish all the levels. I just got to Paris and am still in the subway.

### [PGR2 Paris](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/05/pgr2_paris.html)

As of this moment I am ranked 1710 in the city of Paris for Project Gotham Racing 2. I've been playing it all night. There are several new tracks and cars that are **finally** downloadable from XBox Live for the game. It costs 5 bucks and of course it's more than worth it.

There are a couple of really good tracks. Several of which (of course) run around the traffic circle at L'Arc du Triumphe. There's a really nice tri-oval called Les Deux Ponts (The Two Bridges) which I predict is going to be the Paris equivalent of KGB Corner. It's fast. And there are some interesting hairpins and cresting turns that throw you a curve. But by far the most challenging aspects of the new Paris tracks are the traffic circles. There are some you can more or less take a straight line through, some you have to angle towards and accellerate through and some where you have to slow down and do a chicane-like maneuver. Sometimes there are two of them and you have to remember which side is deadly depending on which direction you're going. These dividers are trickier than the ones in Chicago, so be prepared.

The playing field is leveled a bit. The TVR Cerbera Speed 12 is available in the download. Ha ha to all you scrubs who paid 30 bucks for the cheat. I've heard that the color glitch has been fixed, but I haven't verified that.

There are seven new cars in the download including the Speed 12. The most fun to drive so far is the Ferarri 288 GTO. It's got nice accelleration and speed and it's a real slider. Somebody said that it's the one Magnum PI used to drive, but that was a 308. They look very much alike. Also the new BMW 645 and the Corvette C6 are included. The 'Vette's about the same as the Z06 with a slightly growlier engine and what seems to be taller gearing. The BMW has amazing brakes. The others I have yet to try.

Interestingly enough, there's no weather selections when you're hosting Paris. I would have really liked to have seen the Eiffel Tower at night, but.. il n'est pas possible. Alors..

### [New XBox Titles](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/05/new_xbox_titles.html)

This week and last, I broke my own rule of renting from Blockbuster since I already pay Gamefly. But the new games that have come out, I just had to try. I got 007 Everything or Nothing, Spinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow, Red Dead Revolver and Ninja Gaiden. I would have liked to find Rallisport 2, but they didn't have it.

007 has been out for a while and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I didn't get very far through the game but I think it degraded my skills for Rainbox Six. That lock-on targetting system really takes the right thumb out of practice. All in all I rate it highly. It's one of the best third person action titles since Brute Force.

Ninja Gaiden sucks. I understand why somebody would like it, that is to say somebody 10 years old like my boy. But it's just not my style. A bit too much button mashy for my tastes.

Red Dead Revolver is the bomb. I'm only three chapters into this and I'm really opening up a can of wild west whoopass. The duelling interface is innovative and cool. They've really done a bang-up job and I intend to get fairly immersed into this puppy..

BUT...

Chances are I won't get a chance to do much of anything other than to play Pandora Tomorrow. I don't know what I did wrong when I played Splinter Cell the first time, but I just didn't get it. Or perhaps I just wanted to run and gun at the time and never got anywhere. But this time, I am fully engaged. I like sneaking around a lot, especially since I've been getting snuffed in Rainbow Six 3. This kind of sneaking is cooler than Metal Gear Solid, and less forgiving. It doesn't get much better than this.

I'm looking forward to playing the online game too, because it's re-orients the controls and gives a completely different challenge.

### [Rainbow Sicks](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/05/rainbow_sicks.html)

I decided to buy Rainbow Six 3 and am getting my butt splattered in the Live game. My ELO is somwhere in the low 700s which means I get killed 8 times for every kill. But since I'm something of a butt kicker in PGR2, my friends are gracious enough not to boot me out of their rooms. What I don't understand about R63 is that my guns don't seem to work in the live game anywhere near as effectively as they do in story mode. As I run through the missions, I can double tap tangos with my AK and they're down. But I've emptied a whole magazine at close range and not beaten down live adversaries when I've gotten the jump on them. I've swapped weapons a couple times, but to no avail.

Interestingly enough, on Ghost Recon, I'm pretty good, especially in the pistols only fights. So I took that idea and tried to run around with a Desert Eagle, and my roomies are clowning me, like I don't know there are assault rifles in the game.

I generally play fairly aggressively in Co-op mode, but I haven't seemed to find my rhythm. A lot of that is because I don't know most of the maps from both teams yet. In fact, I've only played Green Team a couple times, and I was so twisted I almost fragged a partner. I really hate being a newbie in this. It's a really good game but it's less fun than XIII right now because I'm just dead meat in it. I'm starting to regret my purchase...

I have a friend whom I hope is going to show me some tricks to increase my skills. We'll see.

### [The Library of Games Fallacy](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/04/the_library_of_.html)

Every once in a while I hear this bogus argument about PS2 being better than XBox because it has a larger library of games. This cannot be true of any one person and is fast becoming marginal for the console audience itself. You'll also note that PS2 partisans don't concede that the PC is a better gaming platform because there are more titles available for PC.

I've played something on the order of 100 different games for the XBox and there could be more but I don't remember where I put the list. But this is an insane amount of games representing about $5000 worth of software. (Of course I rented most of it). For any one player or household there is only likely to be a couple dozen games owned. Therefore I say that it's the quality of the best games that makes the biggest difference in the value of the platform, not the total number of games.

Everyone concedes that Halo2 is destined to be a world-rocking affair. Viva XBox!

### [Rise of Nations](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/04/rise_of_nations.html)

I've made the plunge and picked up a PC strategy game. My choice: [Rise of Nations](http://www.microsoft.com/games/riseofnations/). I played for about 4 hours last night (and early this morning) and have found it to be just as good as I thought it would be.

My first time out, I basically got to medieval and beat up my neighbors. But they started it. I would have liked my first time out to be a bit more peaceful so that I could regard the economics a bit closer, but I just generally found that I would have a surplus of life. That is to say the game put me in a situation rather quickly where I would get bored and rich but not able to expand my population, the question of military adventure arise quickly.

It's clearly addictive, deep and complex without taking huge amounts of time to make progress. More to come.

### [PC Gaming](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/04/pc_gaming.html)

Ooh baby, I'm cooking with gas. Now that I've got the Shuttle fully righteous, I'm willing to be down with the PC game crowd. Not since A-Train and The Sims, have I done much PC gaming. I have come to understand that I've missed a little bit.

A couple years ago in my pre XBox days when I suffered the indignities of getting thrashed in Super Mario Kart by a 7 year old boy, I said to myself it was time for a change. So before I spent a grip on a console, I looked for what was hot. The result was Sin, Everquest and Black & White. I was told that these were the finest the PC had to offer.

Sin was actually fairly enjoyable even though it overburdened my machine. I really never got past any decent level and once I got stuck at a checkpoint with a non-elidable cut scene, I tossed it. I found Black & White to be fairly entertaining for a time but I really got annoyed with the UI. Once my monkey was on a leash, I had all these stupid leash commands that never quite worked. He got tangled up at the entrance to the temple and I dumped that one. Also, one of the shoulder angels glitched so I could see but not hear him. Ick. By the time I started the tutorial to Everquest and found that I couldn't jump up a ledge, I thought, well maybe I'll just use magic for the whole game. By that time, I ran into some ducats, said f it and bought my XBox. I've never looked back.

Recently, however I've gotten the urge to do a real seriously grown up strategic kind of thing. All I can think of is 'Age of Empires' because it sounds grown up and strategic. (Whereas Condi Rice makes 'strategic' sound like excuse making.) So I'm asking for a little help here. BTW I've got a big fat flat panel and a Radeon and an optical cordless mouse, I think things can be more pleasant.

### [She Beat Me](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/04/she_beat_me.html)

[![](http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/sc2-necrid-thumb.jpg)](http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/sc2-necrid.html)  
Even though I know better, I like to occasionally poke fun at feminists for not having all the answers. Plus, I'm Dad, so I get to stand up as a very fulfilled individual patriarch, aka proud poppa.

Sure there's some folks who like to beat me up about letting my kids play video games, but I think I'm on good ground when I suggest that they're better than television. So on that limb I suppose it's a good thing that my daughters are gaining skills as button mashers in Soul Calibur 2, and they're kicking my butt.

So what are we to make of it when a 9 year old girl opens a can of whoopass on her dad? Well, it's all great fun and that's all we care about around here.

I didn't think that I was going to like this game as much as I have, being a Virtua Fighter snob from way back when. It turns out to have all of the subtleties of the VF series including blocking, throws (although not reversals), side motions and combos. The game is pretty large with a narrative section, a bunch of alternative weapons, corny dialog and very cool combat environments.

Most impressive of all is the practice mode. All cheats are built into the system so that you can see what moves there are. So you can have an infinite life and practice until your fingers get numba;dn...

### [Open Source Gaming](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/02/open_source_gam.html)

It's probably old news to some hardcore PC gamers, but some of the founders of the XBox team at Microsoft defected early in the program. One of these lights ended up a joint called [Infinium](http://www.infiniumlabs.net/).

They've got a box called the Phantom which, with presumeably commonly available engines, will allow ordinary game programmers to develop games without jumping through the licensing deals and red tape of dealing with the big platform vendors. Nice

### [Pazaak, Tatooine & The Sith](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2004/01/pazaak_tatooine.html)

I am about 27 hours into Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic and it occurs to me that the epic novel is back. Except it's not a novel, but a video game.

It seems almost disrespectful to call this massive interactive tale a video game. I realized that once I finally managed to capture the Ebon Hawk from Davik and Calo Nord when Talis was being destroyed. I flew through the atmosphere, fought off a dozen smaller spacecraft, and just like Han Solo's Millenium Falcon I punched into hyperspace.

It wasn't until I started playing this particular game (and I have played one other Star Wars game before, finding it tedious and unusually difficult) that I realized how much Lucas has made of his galaxy far far away. I knew there were many series of books written and I knew that many Star Wars fan[atic]s had been very disappointed in recent films that I thought were pretty good. I thought all of that was playing off the simplistic themes of the first (middle) trilogy of films. But KOR shows that this galaxy is at least as well thought out as that of the Star Trek series.

After having watched the bonus material for the making of Episode One, I concluded that Lucas was a self-important monomaniac who only had one idea in his life that he was milking forever. Now I'm not so sure. Now I see him more like Linus Torvalds, as the facilitator of a garden where 1000 flowers are blooming.

The Star Wars Galaxy is massive, and hundreds of creative people are populating its planets, pushing and pulling its Force and making a lot of fun and adventure for us. More power to them. Now excuse me, I have some more Wookiees to liberate.

### [Games & Gamers](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2003/12/games_gamers_1.html)

Adding this new pseudo-intellectual category, I will be splitting off all my gamer stuff from Critical Theory. I've just met a guy who knows something about game programming and is of an artistic persuasion. So as I delve deep into dungeons with dragons of all sorts, I'll blab about it here.

I'm strictly XBox, although I will consider stategy games for the PC.

### [True Crime: Streets of LA](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2003/11/true_crime_stre_1.html)

I was prepared to hate this game. I suffered through what I thought was a pretty cheesy intro movie and started shooting at the practice target range. The bullets didn't come out fast enough and I put it down. Plus, the music was too raw for my baby ears.

So I played GTA Vice City instead. I got through several missions and played it deep into the night, and then the worst happened. The gameplay started to make me nauseous. Not aesthetically nauseous, but physically as when some combination of shaky-cam effects, frame rate and motion in the game start jangling the wrong combination of neurons and creates the kind of headache you get from reading in a car.

In Vice City, the best thing is carjacking of course, and it's always fun to whack somebody over the head with a four iron. But the difference between carjacking in Vice City and True Crime is all the difference for a gamer like me. In Vice City, you just plant yourself in the middle of the street, the car or truck or bus will stop whether you are looking or not. You press a button and yank somebody out. In LA it doesn't work like that, you get run over.

As soon as I walked into the Hotel in Vice City I said, haven't I been here before? I had. It was Max Payne minus some of the grit. But enough of Vice City. It's weak compared to True Crime: Streets of LA.

### [T.H.U.G.](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2003/11/thug_1.html)

  
I am older than [Adam Sessler](http://www.techtv.com/xplay/story/0,24330,3422529,00.html). I am probably one of the oldest gamers who's not in the game industry itself. I have at least 25 friends online from XBox Live and I know only one of them is anywhere near my age. But he's the guy who runs the most reality type sims on MotoGP2 and I think he's an old fart. He hates crashing. Me, I dig a little hardcore.

This weekend, I've prompted a minor celebration of sorts. I'm pretty sure that I'm going to get a job. It's the exact job that I wanted 2 years ago just after nine-eleven when I was desiring to be a mushroom. More on that later. The celebration involved getting three XBox rentals from Blockbuster.

**Tony Hawk Underground**  
This game is so very cool that it makes me want to learn how to skate for real. The wide open environments provide a definite improvement over the previous games. And as usual, the 'Create-A-Skater' is even cooler than The Sims for creating very realistic human avatars for the game. Only in Tony Hawk's world can I make somebody who looks very much like me.

You start off your adventure in 'New Jersey', a cross between the 'hood and the ghetto. You build your street cred by doing tricks completing tasks in a grungy locale. If you are successful in rescuing one of the locals from revenge from drug dealers by jumping over the bridge where the cops are and saving the bum's house... well it's a long story, but you do get to go to Manhattan.

The narrative makes for a cool adventure. The music is off the hook. I swear that I am hearing Acey Alone rapping in parts of the soundtrack, but I've been 'hearing' him in Jurassic 5 too, and I don't quite trust my ears. My avatar's voice is stupid and doesn't sound like any of the real gamer kids I play online, then again Tony Hawk had to keep his T rating.

The gameplay is faster than I recall from the other TH games, but the number of grind opportunities in this environment is crazy sweet. In that it's a lot more realistic than the other games. I've been playing about 5 hours and have yet to hit a Varial but I'm fast becoming a very good grinder. In a decent tribute to Jet Set Radio Future, you can grind telephone & power cables above street level which adds a very cool dimension of challenge to already grind rich areas.

The kids are loving it, and I have to say that Hawk did a very fine job of creating a total environment. But just starting off in 'New Jersey' says it all. This game has got soul.

### [OICW](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2003/09/oicw_1.html)

I don't know if Heckler & Koch is an American company. Well, of course there is a US corporation but the company originated in the ruins of the Mauser works in post WW2 Germany. They have apparently dominated the imagination of the US Military with their newest rifle, a sophisticated affair called the OICW.

OICW stands for Objective Individual Combat Weapon, and has gotten the designation M29. It's a rather massive thing for a machine gun and is chockablock with goodies like timed explosive rounds. If your enemy is behind a wall, you can use the rangefinder and program a bullet shot just over the wall to rain down deadly shards at the precise moment. The theory is that this capability will shorten standoffs against the enemy in 'dug-in' positions, not to mention save ammo.

This gun is going to cost about 15,000 apiece and weigh about three times as much as the standard M16, but such considerations mean nothing in videogame simulations. This is how I came to recognize the OICW. The Ghost Recon Island Thunder online game for the XBox allows you to select this weapon for your three member platoons as you carry out missions in a post-Castro Cuba. In gaming this is a great weapon, and your avatar doesn't seem to run any slower with it.

The Germans have come back in their characteristically precise way in helping us to understand the technical specifications of the OICW and other arms as represented in the Ubisoft game. At RainbowSix.org one can check out the [Detallierte Waffenlisten](http://www.rainbowsix.org/ghostrecon/guides/weapon_list/index.php).

RPGs seem to be doing a great deal of damage these days in Iraq. The deployment of the M29 may herald a new era in which every rifleman will have equivalent firepower on the go. H&K will definitely play a significant role in the future of urban warfare. With any luck, this expensive, heavy and deadly weapon will not be just a videogame fantasy.

### [Review: Midtown Madness 3](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2003/06/review_midtown__1.html)

Race? What Race?

There's one problem with MM3, and that is you cannot get outside of your car, walk and look around. The driving play is so immersive and the environments so recognizeable that you can't help just driving around saying "Hey, I know that place!".  
MM3 is silly driving and smash 'em up fun. I've been online a couple times and people are just happy to play in 'cruise' mode, with absolutely no objective to the game but to talk to each other while driving around Paris (or DC) wrecking into people, objects or each other.

The arcade style of the game is very much like Midnight Club but the controls are an order of magnitude better. I'll just say it: Midnight Club sucks as compared to Midtown Madness 3. It's fairly challenging and I'll probably get back to it, but the free roam driving is so much fun, I may not. Actually, 'free roam' is a good way to think of MM3. Think of the free roam mode of Project Gotham without the cones, add pedestrians and wreckable stuff, voila!

In MM3, if you are in the mood to go on a rampage of destruction, there are hundreds of lampposts, park benches, barriers, traffic signs, cafe umbrellas and tables and other objects to knock around. And if you're in a real Hulk mood, you can drive a garbage truck and take out some statues and kiosks.

The detail is fabulous. There's even an underground parking garage at what I believe is the Kennedy Center in DC complete with gates to crash through. There are also ramps placed at various places, like the Capitol Building so you can jump your vehicle over fountains, creeks and the like.

Now it must be said that the graphics are good, but nowhere near as good as Project Gotham. Control of your vehicle is comparable though and the layout of the controls are the same.

There's plenty more to explore in this one but it is, behind Gotham, the most laugh out loud driving game for the XBOX yet. Yes I like it better than Midnight Club 2, Crazy Taxi, Yakuza Mission, Rallisport, Sega GT 2002 but not as much as MotoGP2.

On the other hand, three cities would have been better, and people haven't really been racing with it online...

### [Suzuka & Mugello](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2003/06/suzuka_mugello_1.html)

If you've wondered where Cobb has been the past few days, the answer is Japan and Italy racing motorcycles of course. Huh? Well, only virtually. I've been up until 3 in the AM racing with XBox Live friends via [MotoGP2](http://www.thq.com/games/52016/), one of the most intense gaming experiences ever.

If you should happen to think that is a weird thing for anyone to be doing, you may be right. On the other hand, there are about 13,500 of us [doing this](http://www.climax.co.uk/media/media.aspx?ArticleID=243). My current rank after about 12 hours of racing is 7138. I'll let you know when I break into the next quartile.

### [XBOX is Live](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2003/05/xbox_is_live_1.html)

I bought XBox Live yesterday and if this review seems incoherent in spots, it's because I was up all night and early this morning playing. It's better than I thought.

I have a headstart because I'm a bit techy. I knew that I'd need some RJ45 Cat 5 cable. So I got an overpriced bright blue 14 foot length at the local CompUSA for 30 bucks. That's long enough for it to reach my Netgear RP114 router which is under my desk in the next room. I plugged it into an empty slot, turned on the XBox and put in the Live disk.

It loaded XBox Live software to the XBox disk in about 45 seconds and then started playing videos. I thought they were part of the setup but they're not. Just take out the disk, power down and power up and you have a new menu on the XBox bootup. Nice.

I let it autoconfigure and it did a good job of guessing but it couldn't connect at first. I went to the website and it was easy to find the instructions for my particular router. I entered a new IP address at the Router for the XBox and started again. I made the adjustments on the XBox manual configuration and it worked like a charm.

The registration is a bit tedious - filling out addresses and personal info takes a long time with the XBox controller. But I was up and running in no time. I picked my gamertag (sixoseven) and it was available. Cool!

The disk I got has demo versions of MotoGP, the superbike race, SUPER COOL and MechAttack, AWESOME. So you don't have to buy full blown versions to play online. I didn't expect that. I had to wait until my wife gave up the big TV so I didn't get started until about 12 midnight West Coast time. Still, there were people ready to play as soon as I got hooked up. Needless to say, most of them were in Western Europe. Wow!

The voice thingy works brilliantly, but sometimes it's hard to understand French accents with the Helium voice. Which is just as well sometimes when the trash talk gets crazy. I have to say, even though some gamers get rude, the network is a step above your average chat room in civility. Plus if you really don't like someone, you can gang up on them. But you can also meet cool people - while playing Destruction in MechAttack some of us discussed the ending to Matrix Reloaded. Great!

This dimension of play is great. You will find yourself shouting, groaning, laughing and discovering personalities behind the robots (or motorcycles as the case may be). I'm really looking forward to trying a first person shooter, I'm sure it will be incredibly great. I've already made some new friends from France and the UK (since I've been playing in their daylight time zones) and I'm looking forward to building up my reputation in a bunch of game worlds.

XBox is everything it promised to be. It's worth respecting Microsoft for, and for me that's really saying something.

### [Review: Toe Jam & Earl III](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2003/01/review_toe_jam__1.html)

Toe Jam & Earl Three is by far one of the most satisfying games i've played on the XBox for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, the game is funky fresh. That's right. If you can remember that saying from back in the days when hiphop was playful and simple, this game is right there. It's got Bootsy Collins and UTFO appeal complete with breakdancing, complicated dap, and pg-rated street dialog which is right up to date.

Secondly, the game is very clever in its concept of integrating lighthearted funk culture into a theme of integration and redemption. (did I actually say that?) Funky aliens come down from the planet Funkatron to funkify obnoxious earthlings and rescue the 12 vinyl albums which are the source of all funk in the universe from the minions of the anti-funk. There is no killing or anything, it's about using music to transform squares, geeks and a host of hilarious characters (including a demented dentist) into afro sportin' Bootsy sunglasses wearing disco dancers, for a moment anyway.

It was my wife who picked out the game. When I first played it, I had to do a double-take. Funk in a videogame? I kept thinking they're going to screw up something and I'm going to be offended. But I wasn't disappointed, in fact I was inspired. The authors ought to be proud of delivering the bomb metaphysics in a way even George Clinton himself would appreciate. And of course if you are truly funky, you'll be pleased at all the inside jokes and references even if you are not familiar with the earlier Toe Jam titles.

My elementary school kids absolutely love it. They sing the songs, they repeat the dialog (which has some subtle double-entendres on the border of pg-13, but you can turn the characters from 'naughty' to 'nice') and they run to tell me when they graduate from a 'dufus' to a 'poindexter'.

Now here's the kicker. I have never seen a videogame of any sort in which you use musical skills to defeat the enemy. But TJ&E will have you playing your XBox controller like a beat box to infect the earthlings with that irresistible funk fu.

Gameplay is not particularly challenging, it's laidback adventuring capture the goody style without tricky puzzles or traditional boss challenges. But there are plenty enough levels to keep you busy and characters that can render you helpless in novel and frustrating ways. This is another game that even when you die it's funny, and there's plenty fun to be had just roaming through the levels and having your avatar speak to the other characters. I wish there were more avatars to choose from and you run into the occasional glitch where your character gets stuck in some crevice, like between a tree and a lake shore. But on the whole the execution is very smooth and you are totally immersed. Action gets fast and furious like Gauntlet. The voices are excellent and the music is just right.

The levels are bright and fanciful with a kind naive surrealism and you get to run around like Bebe's kids trick or treating and kicking silly rabbits to the curb. It has the same kind of snarky badboy appeal as Conker's Bad Fur Day but in a totally lighthearted way. It's not even as dark as Banjo Kazooie or Blinx. In that way it's really cool for kids and you can play and play and lose and lose without getting angry, which is a lot to say given the state many videogames leave you in.

In the end it's all about the funk, what could be cooler?

### [Minority Report the Videogame](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2002/12/minority_report_1.html)

Sucks!

this is the kind of mindless violent idiocy that people who have never played videogames think all videogames are like.

how crappy is this game? let me count the ways. it is crappy in the way it's a third person shooter and weapons automatically lock on. it has crappy camera positioning. the animation is jerky, and looks like something for nintendo 64, not xbox. anderton's face is a mask of brutality.

the premise is cool, the way you can throw someone through a plate glass window is cool (but the execution is nowhere near as nice as spiderman), and the heat-wave effects in the stun weapon is cool. all that adds up to is about 1 hour of basic training and gameplay and then utter disgust.
