***Welcome to Things Worth Remembering, in which writers recall wisdom from the past that we should commit to heart. Last week, our farm correspondent [Larissa Phillips](https://www.thefp.com/w/larissa-phillips) celebrated the young adult adventure novel [The Black Stallion](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780679813439). This week, [Benjamin Carlson](https://x.com/bfcarlson) reveals the central, chilling lesson of Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s masterpiece [Demons](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780679734512).***

> “My dear, the real truth always sounds improbable, do you know that? To make truth sound probable you must always mix in some falsehood with it. Men have always done so.”  
> —Fyodor Dostoyevsky, *Demons*

The first time I read Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s *Demons*—which you may know by the equally enticing names *[The Devils](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9789364286732)* or *The Possessed*—I was 16, possibly 17. I remember where I was: the rain-spattered porch in the Poconos where my family spent summers. Thick droplets of water thundered on the leaves. And the pages came to life with that revelatory intensity I associate with only a few books in my life: the Bible. *[The Magus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16286.The_Magus)*. *[Siddhartha](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780553208849)*. *[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780063342330)*.

There was a rumble of thunder. Cool air. The dark summer day enclosed and amplified the raging energy of that weird Russian meganovel—Dostoyevsky’s third masterpiece to be hammered out in an astonishing sprint of genius nearly 20 years after his release from a Siberian gulag. Then and now, *Demons* is an unsettled, imbalanced, ungainly book that doesn’t even have an agreed-upon name. And I was intoxicated by it.

That was the post-9/11 era. America was wounded and angry. I didn’t have the words for it then, but *Demons* gave me a shape for what I felt—not an explanation of politics, but an intuition for what happens when ideas burn too hot. They do not merely inspire the people who hold them. They annihilate them.

I’ve read it several times since: during the financial crisis, before the 2016 election, during the Covid pandemic, and now again at age 40. I don’t read it as a political treatise. I read it the way others might visit a grave.

*[The Possessed](https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/POSSESSED-Novel-Three-Parts-DOSTOEVSKY-Fyodor/30343340175/bd)*, as it was first and most elegantly translated in 1913 by Constance Garnett, unfolded serially from 1871 to 1872 in a St. Petersburg periodical. Ever since, and especially after the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917, it has been regarded as prophetic. Not because Dostoyevsky predicted a specific historical event, but because he revealed a durable spiritual pattern.

So what did this book teach a young American—on a rainy porch, in the shadow of national trauma—that changed my view of the world so deeply?

Among too many insights to count, this is the central one: *Idealistic movements often turn into their opposites*.

*Demons* begins with a long, slow exposition of Russian liberal high society, all polite progressivism and complacency. Only later do you realize you’ve been pulled into a mad conspiracy born out of that very complacency.

A group of radicals descends on a provincial town with the goal of provoking a revolution. They do this by insinuating themselves into high (and low) society, and smiling while they spread baseness, chaos, and ultimately murder. The townspeople are either blind to the threat or helpless against it. The conspirators, meanwhile, are a mix of true believers and cynics: naive student radicals, strident atheists, smarmy elites, and underemployed academic theorists. (Stop me if any of this sounds familiar.)

The results, of course, are deadly.

The most noble character—Nikolai Stavrogin—is also the most chilling antihero in all of Dostoyevsky’s fiction. Handsome, intelligent, and magnetic, he believes in nothing. Even to the point of paradox: He cannot fully believe in his own disbelief.

A voluptuous nihilist, he commits an unthinkable crime—seducing a child—and drives her to suicide. In his confession, he writes: “Every unusually disgraceful, utterly degrading, dastardly, and, above all, ridiculous situation, in which I ever happened to be in my life, always roused in me, side by side with extreme anger, an incredible delight.” [The chapter](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/57050/57050-h/57050-h.htm#r64) where he confesses his crime was—and is—so disturbing it was [censored for decades](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/demons). It’s also one of the most powerful pieces of literature ever written.

Stavrogin’s torment becomes a kind of mirror for the entire novel. He must know: Is there anything true enough to live for—or to die for?

Midway through the book, the radicals gather in secret for the first time. They are self-serious, electrified by the importance of their mission. They believe themselves the vanguard of a new society. But their leader, Pyotr Verkhovensky, ignores them, and spends the meeting cutting his fingernails.

He knows what they don’t: Their ideals don’t matter. The real game is power.

And then comes the passage I think about all the time, spoken by a theorist named Shigalyov, who has developed a rigorous system for liberating mankind.

His conclusion?

> “I got entangled in my own data, and my conclusion directly contradicts the original idea I start from. Starting from unlimited freedom, I conclude with unlimited despotism. I will add, however, that there is no other solution to the social formula but mine.”

The conspirators laugh him down. But it’s no joke. It’s the keystone of the book. The desire to free mankind ends in tyranny. Freedom requires order. Order becomes control. Control becomes violence. The circle closes.

Verkhovensky, too, is unforgettable: a cloying, abusive, slippery sociopath cloaked in liberal ideals. He wears the skin of good manners like a disguise. He flatters, lies, and schemes. He is, in a sense, a hack politician *avant la lettre*. He uses the language of liberation to conceal the hunger for domination.

Then there’s Kirillov, the fervent nihilist who believes that to prove total freedom from God, he must kill himself, becoming a kind of human god in the act. His wrestling with this idea yields some of the most poignant and profound moments in the book:

> “So at last you understand!” cries Kirillov rapturously. “So it can be understood if even a fellow like you understands. Do you understand now that the salvation for all consists in proving this idea to every one? Who will prove it? I! I can’t understand how an atheist could know that there is no God and not kill himself on the spot. To recognize that there is no God and not to recognize at the same instant that one is God oneself is an absurdity, else one would certainly kill oneself. . . . That’s all I can do to prove in the highest point my independence and my new terrible freedom. For it is very terrible. I am killing myself to prove my independence and my new terrible freedom.”

The movement toward death often masquerades as redemption. That’s why Dostoyevsky’s long, strange, imperfect book—as complex and irreducible as life itself, as a living person—still speaks to us a century and a half after he wrote it.

We always assume moral warnings are meant for others. But Dostoyevsky doesn’t let you off that easily. The warning is not about your enemies. It’s about you.

Every movement that burns hot enough will attract opportunists, zealots, and eventually, destroyers. Even the most righteous cause can be hollowed out from within.

And so I keep reading *Demons*. Again and again. Not because I enjoy the darkness, but because I fear it. Because I see signs of it, flickering at the edge of things. And because somewhere, in the rain on the leaves, I can hear the warning.
