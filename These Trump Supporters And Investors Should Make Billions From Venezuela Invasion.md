fter the U.S. military abducted Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro on Saturday, Wall Street watchers were quick to declare the biggest winner: [Paul Singer](https://www.forbes.com/profile/paul-singer/ "https://www.forbes.com/profile/paul-singer/"), the $6.7 billion (net worth) hedge fund manager famous for investing in distressed assets around the world. Amber Energy, a Houston-based startup backed by Elliott, recently prevailed in a U.S. federal court auction to buy Venezuelan oil company Citgo, which owns three refineries in Louisiana, Texas and Illinois, plus a distribution network of 4,000 Citgo gas stations, for $5.9 billion – what many deem to be a steal.

A Trump supporter who helped bankroll his transition team, Singer may indeed be the biggest winner, but he’s not the only Wall Street mogul poised to benefit from the Citgo deal. *Forbes* spoke with several people involved in the deal, and it turns out there are other bigtime players backing Elliot and Amber’s bid to run Citgo, on top of other hedge funds and investment firms that are poised to capture a windfall.

Elliott, according to a person familiar with the deal, is funding a third of the equity and leading a consortium of Wall Street heavyweights. The group includes Los Angeles-based alternatives investor Oaktree Capital Management, led by billionaires [Howard Marks](https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-marks/ "https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-marks/") and [Bruce Karsh](https://www.forbes.com/profile/bruce-karsh/ "https://www.forbes.com/profile/bruce-karsh/"), according to two people familiar with the matter. Also part of the consortium is $43 billion (assets) hedge fund Silver Point Capital. Based in Greenwich, CT, the firm was founded and is run by Ed Mulé and Robert O'Shea, former Goldman Sachs Group partners who each held senior positions in the firm's fixed-income division.

Apollo Global Management, run by another billionaire Trump supporter [Marc Rowan](https://www.forbes.com/profile/marc-rowan/ "https://www.forbes.com/profile/marc-rowan/") (net worth $8.3 billion) who was briefly considered a candidate for treasury secretary, is leading debt financing, two people familiar with the deal said. According to court documents, this involves Amber taking on $3.8 billion in first-lien debt and issuing $2.85 billion in convertible notes. Also mentioned is a $25 million equity investment from an Elliott affiliate.

Then there are the energy executives and tycoons who helped set up Amber, which was incorporated in August 2024, for the express purpose of bidding on Citgo. Amber’s president is Jeff Stevens, former cofounder (with billionaire [Paul Foster](https://www.forbes.com/profile/paul-foster/ "https://www.forbes.com/profile/paul-foster/")) of Western Refining in 1997, which started with a single plant in El Paso, Texas. Stevens and Foster later sold Western for $6 billion in 2017 to Andeavor, which was then run by Greg Goff, Amber’s CEO. Two years later, they sold Andeavor to Marathon Petroleum in 2019 for $36 billion.

Goff and Stevens who held onto Marathon shares got to know the energy team at Elliott, led by John Pike, when they were all on the same side of subsequent activist agitation against Marathon. They first succeeded in pushing CEO Gary Heminger to retire in 2019; the parties then helped orchestrate the 2020 sale of Marathon’s subsidiary Speedway, which operated 4,000 filling stations at the time, for $21 billion to the Japanese parent company of 7-11. Elliott has also spent years agitating at Phillips 66, in which it owns $2.7 billion in shares, and pushing for asset sales.

Amber’s winning bid for Citgo was controversial long before Trump’s latest move. After a decade of litigation, months of testimony and a lengthy auction process, U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Delaware, who issued a 168-page opinion explaining his decision, ruled in Amber’s favor, despite the fact that its bid was $2 billion lower than at least one rival.

Its biggest rival for Citgo was a consortium led by a small Canadian mining company called Gold Reserve (which had mines expropriated by Venezuela’s late President Hugo Chavez in 2011), and which was initially backed by fellow creditor Koch Industries. Gold Reserve executive vice chair Paul Rivett is still angry that he didn’t win the day with a bid of nearly $8 billion. “Why is it that Citgo is going to a lower bidder?” asks Rivett, who says he had financing from J.P. Morgan lined up. “It should never have happened.”

In his opinion approving Amber’s bid, the judge explained that the special master (the agent of the judge overseeing the auction process) in the case recommended Amber’s bid over Gold Reserve because it stood a better chance of closing the deal. According to Gold Reserve, which is filing a last-ditch appeal this week in the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals to try to overturn Judge Stark’s order, the Citgo auction process was marred by conflicts of interest: law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, and investment bank advisory firm Evercore, key advisors to the court-appointed special master, were also collecting fees from Elliot for separate legal work. The Delaware judge previously dismissed these concerns in an opinion as “procedurally defective” and “based on waived arguments,” and refused to recognize their legitimacy.

Also notable: neither Venezuela nor PDVSA will see any of the $5.9 billion. It’s all earmarked to satisfy the claims of a dozen companies and investors that bought bonds secured against those assets. That includes ConocoPhillips, in line to get $1.4 billion; Vancouver-listed mining outfit Rusoro, set to get $400 million in cash and $650 million in convertible debts, and Red Tree Investments, an affiliate of Greenwich-based hedge fund Contrarian Capital Management, expected to get at least $330 million from the payout. Another big winner is New York-based Tenor Capital Management, a $9 billion hedge fund that acquired the claims that defunct mining company Crystallex had brought against Venezuela after President Hugo Chavez nationalized its mining prospects there in 2011. After funding years of litigation, Tenor will get a lion's share of more than $1 billion (from Amber) earmarked to pay the Crystallex claims.

The special master and judge ultimately sided with Elliott and Amber because they had already gone to the trouble of dealing with a separate group of bondholders who purchased debt issued by Venezuela in 2016. These bonds (known as the PDVSA 2020 bonds), were secured by 50.1% of the shares of Citgo, putting their holders in potential conflict with other creditors such as Gold Reserve. During proceedings, Amber struck a deal with a group holding more than 75% of the PDVSA 2020 bonds to buy all of the bonds, and then extinguish them for $2.1 billion. Rival bidder Gold Reserve, in contrast, didn’t bother coming to terms with those bondholders, betting that they wouldn’t have to: The PDVSA 2020 bonds’ validity was being challenged in a separate court case in the Southern District of New York. If ruled invalid, holders wouldn’t be in line for any cash from the Citgo auction at all, leaving more for other claimants. But U.S. Judge Katherine Failla ruled in that case last September that the PDVSA 2020 bonds were in fact valid. “In essence, Gold Reserve and Amber took opposite sides of a bet that could only pay off for one of them,” Judge Stark wrote in his opinion. “In the end, Amber’s number came up and Gold Reserve’s did not.”

Elliott has deep experience navigating troubled sovereign debt markets. Singer, now 81, famously bought distressed sovereign Argentina debt after Argentina’s 2001 economic crash, then held on tenaciously for over a decade before finally prevailing in 2016. They collected $2.4 billion on bonds they purchased for $117 million that had a face value of $617 million.

Oaktree, too, [has previous](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oaktrees-venezuela-bet-spurs-long-running-dispute-1463065325 "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oaktrees-venezuela-bet-spurs-long-running-dispute-1463065325") experience in Venezuela, buying a distressed undersea oil-services contractor there in 2010 and ultimately securing a $644 million judgment against PDVSA from a London arbitration panel.

Goff, 64, doesn’t seem interested in slicing and dicing the former Citgo. Rather he wants to own and improve the former Citgo plants, which have been processing around 800,000 barrels per day. “We look forward to working with the talented CITGO team to strengthen the business through capital investment and operational excellence,” said Goff in Amber’s first and only [press release](https://amberenergy.com/amber-energy-approved-as-acquirer-of-citgo-by-u-s-district-court-for-the-district-of-delaware/ "https://amberenergy.com/amber-energy-approved-as-acquirer-of-citgo-by-u-s-district-court-for-the-district-of-delaware/").

Decades ago, before sanctions, the refineries were optimized for heavy sour Venezuelan crude. Because of U.S. sanctions they’ve largely replaced that with oil from the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Whether they’ll switch back to Venezuelan crude in the future all depends on the end of sanctions and how cheap they can get it. If Amber can take advantage of a bumper supply of discounted crude, it could help unlock a lot of value.

While Elliot is only paying $5.9 billion, Citgo may be worth a lot more than that. Citgo’s plants used to be optimized to process heavy crude oil from Venezuela before U.S. sanctions blocked it in 2019, and could soon again as Trump looks to revive Venezuelan crude imports. Analysts cited in court documents pegged Citgo’s value at between $11 to $13 billion, while Venezuela parties claim $18 billion — based on optimistic long-term potential.

In the past year Citgo generated roughly $1 billion in operating income (ebitda), which implies that Amber is paying about 6 times ebitda for the assets. That initially looks to be a nice discount compared to America's leading refiners like Valero and Marathon, trading at 11 and 10 times ebitda, while smaller PBF and Delek trade considerably higher due to depressed earnings.

Another metric to consider is what a barrel of daily oil processing capacity is worth. At $5.9 billion implied enterprise value, and 800,000 bpd of capacity, the deal values Citgo at $7,300 per barrel processed per day. That’s largely in line with the likes of Valero Energy, which processes 3.2 million barrels per day from 15 refineries and has an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of $52 billion. That equates to about $16,000 of EV/bpd.

Some smaller operators that are nearly the same size as Citgo trade for much more. HF Sinclair, with 700,000 bpd (but more pipeline assets as well) is at $15,000 per bpd. Delek, at 400,000 bpd is valued at $13,000 ev/bpd. The implication is that if Goff and his team are able to improve operations at the Citgo plants and build on its $1 billion in ebitda (perhaps with the tailwind of discounted Venezuelan crude), they could add billions more to Amber’s enterprise value.

Amber, Elliott and Stevens declined to comment on the record given that the deal hasn’t yet closed. Probably smart given that there is always the chance Judge Stark’s ruling could get overturned on appeal, Or that the sale would be reconsidered given geopolitical changes. New president of Venezuela Delcy Rodriguez has said in recent months that Venezuela does not, and will not, recognize the forced sale of Citgo and is also appealing Judge Stark’s ruling. PDVSA, which already argued in court that Citgo is being sold for way too little, is saying that Venezuela should get some of the profits.

That's laughable to some of the big winners who have gone through a lot to get to this point. That includes Gordon Keep, a director at Rusoro Mining, which expects to receive $1.6 billion from the Amber deal, including some convertible debt. Keep said in a phone interview that Rusoro’s claim goes back to 2011 when Chavez expropriated their gold mines including Choco, which was putting out 100,000 ounces per year. "We used to be a serious company," says Keep, 69. Once the deal closes he expects Rusoro to distribute considerably more cash to shareholders than the current $675 million value of Rusoro's market cap. As for the remaining $650 million Venezuela owes Rusoro: “We’ll look for other ways.”
