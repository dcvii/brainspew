Jim Simons was the greatest investor of all time.  
  
He turned $1000 in 1988 into $4B in 30 years.  
  
His hedge fund achieved 66% returns annually by hiring mathematicians and physicists instead of Wall Street experts.  
  
Here's how a mathematician became the world's best investor: 🧵  

As a kid in the 1940s, Jim loved numbers.  
  
At just 4 years old, he discovered Zeno's Paradox in his dad's car:  
  
"You could always use half of what gas remains, then half of that, so you'd never run out."  
  
But his mind would soon take him somewhere far more complex... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818311463661569/pl/qFmyXhtC7HwD55xM.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=39c&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818311463661569/vid/avc1/480x270/nUuhtKL0BWxhfz8G.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818311463661569/vid/avc1/640x360/uuBxUKD1kVLPfgmQ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818311463661569/vid/avc1/1280x720/EKxQOvFKv86Kf2j0.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

At MIT, Simons blazed through his degree in just 3 years.  
  
His professors told him to study at Berkeley in 1958 to work with Shiing-Shen Chern, a legendary mathematician.  
  
But when he arrived, he discovered Chern wasn't there.  
  
This would lead to an unexpected detour...

In 1964, Simons joined a secretive operation at Princeton.  
  
The Institute for Defense Analyses, working with the NSA, hired him to break Russian codes during the Cold War.  
  
They paid mathematicians well and let them research half the time.  
  
But his government career would end... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818370053894146/pl/0m-gC3FWk3PuZC25.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=99b&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818370053894146/vid/avc1/480x270/i_c9MXt21qgiB37P.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818370053894146/vid/avc1/640x360/S3KMLeDknRIW0Pdj.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818370053894146/vid/avc1/1280x720/pNFD0u1v34Z-y_S8.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

In 1967, Simons saw his boss publish a pro-war article in The New York Times during the Vietnam War.  
  
Disagreeing, he wrote a letter to the editor.  
  
Then he told Newsweek he was focusing on math until the war ended.  
  
Fifteen minutes after his boss found out, Simons was fired.

This firing became his lucky break.  
  
At Stony Brook University in the 1970s, Simons connected with Chern to develop "Chern-Simons theory."  
  
Physicist Ed Witten later found that it explained string theory perfectly.  
  
This ability to see patterns would soon make him billions... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818449984745476/pl/1FlfKBuCq179WlB_.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=e3f&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818449984745476/vid/avc1/480x270/6MFW1lGajLguT7KZ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818449984745476/vid/avc1/640x360/2RnqfUybFyUoYP2Y.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818449984745476/vid/avc1/1280x720/5XqXlBP4IgsSz_z-.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

By 1978, at age 40, Simons grew restless with academic math.  
  
Using family money, he began investing without any formal training.  
"I made quite a lot of money with pure luck," he admitted.  
  
But staring at market data, he spotted something that would change everything...

While economists claimed markets were "efficient" and unpredictable, Simons saw patterns.  
  
Commodities tended to trend.  
Currencies followed subtle rhythms.  
  
There was hidden structure.  
  
The challenge? Finding enough people smart enough to see it too...

In 1982, Simons founded Renaissance Technologies with a weird hiring strategy  
  
Instead of finance experts, he recruited PhDs with no finance experience  
  
"I didn't know how to hire traders, but I knew how to spot brilliant minds"  
  
His first hires? Code-breakers from his NSA days <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818549410664448/pl/ZzJZAwhihpOv1QE2.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=428&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818549410664448/vid/avc1/480x270/wyDCU2FGWXz6bpz7.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818549410664448/vid/avc1/640x360/BNVUxyl7pvhzi13m.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818549410664448/vid/avc1/1280x720/NvAnA2fl4oc3udEY.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Renaissance (his hedge fund) needed an edge nobody else had.  
  
While rivals bought fancy data, Simons' team went old-school.  
  
They visited the Federal Reserve and hand-copied interest rate histories.  
  
They built databases before Wall Street knew what data was.

Then came the real breakthrough:  
  
They found that small patterns, when combined, could predict markets.  
Each signal was tiny, almost invisible.  
  
But together, they formed a system that could see the future of prices.  
  
The results were almost unbelievable... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818650627579904/pl/DIIofn1eQucT23k3.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=d4a&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818650627579904/vid/avc1/480x270/DvLPH8V5sgO9iv4q.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818650627579904/vid/avc1/640x360/5u4oy98Q4kosQVQS.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818650627579904/vid/avc1/1280x720/vKYYAEl3H03epDCk.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

The Medallion Fund became Wall Street's greatest money machine.  
The numbers seemed impossible:  
  
66% annual returns AFTER fees  
5% management fee (normal: 2%)  
44% performance fee (normal: 20%)  
  
Investors begged to get in, but Simons had other plans...

Renaissance discovered the fund had a capacity limit.  
  
Push too much money through their models, and the edge disappeared.  
  
So they made a shocking move: return all outside investor money.  
  
Only employees could invest in the magic money machine.

This created history's greatest wealth factory.  
  
By 2005, Renaissance employed over 100 PhDs, most worth millions or billions.  
  
Scientists who once struggled for research grants now flew private.  
  
But what made it all work wasn't just math...

The secret to Renaissance was the culture Simons built.  
  
100+ PhDs working as one team  
Complete information sharing  
No hiding discoveries  
The best computers and data  
Everyone gets profit shares  
  
But his most powerful rule was yet to come...

No human judgment allowed.  
  
That was Simons' unbreakable law at Renaissance.  
  
"No trade happens because someone has a feeling about a stock!"  
  
Even Simons himself couldn't override the models.  
This killed the emotions that ruin most investors. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818794366464002/pl/9AZbyn9VJBcPK0tJ.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818794366464002/vid/avc1/480x270/QVxDVwH7AZgY7twl.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818794366464002/vid/avc1/640x360/zxX56eNzDzE0OzMH.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1920818794366464002/vid/avc1/1280x720/QFG5OlvTYVhqyXRR.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

By his death in May 2024, Simons had amassed over $31 billion.  
But he didn't buy islands or yachts.  
  
He and his wife Marilyn gave billions to science, especially basic researchthe kind that seems "useless" today but might save lives tomorrow.

Just like his own math did decades earlier.  
  
His foundation supports breakthroughs in autism research, cosmology, and biology.  
  
"I did a lot of math, I made a lot of money, and I gave almost all of it away," he once said.  
  
That was Jim Simons.

In 2006, he tackled America's math education crisis with a fresh approach.  
  
Instead of punishing bad teachers, he celebrated good ones.  
  
Math for America pays NYC teachers an extra $15,000 yearly and builds communities where they feel valued.

By his death, they supported over 1,000 math and science teachers.  
  
His philosophy was simple: create excitement about math, not fear.  
  
"The way to get good people is to pay them properly and make them feel special," he said.

That was Jim Simons.

I just returned from Warren Buffett's 60th Berkshire meeting.  
  
Buffet revealed shocking truths about Japan, AI, and the future of Berkshire's $335B cash pile.  
  
People are calling it one of the best meetings EVER.  
  
Here's what happened (gets crazier as you read): 🧵

This was Buffett's 60th annual meeting and broke all attendance records.  
  
19,700 people showed up just for the shopping day. See's Candy did $317,000 in sales, Brooks did $310,000, and Jazwares doubled their record.  
  
Even at 94, Buffett still commands a room like no one else... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1919731415639588866/pl/9riaioNW7cpkeQhd.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=204&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1919731415639588866/vid/avc1/480x270/jifp3m3ZcM2cXDrZ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1919731415639588866/vid/avc1/640x360/ytSVyVVJ5BtLNnG-.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1919731415639588866/vid/avc1/1280x720/GqPWOmTQsoRg_XAZ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

On Berkshire's Japanese investments, Buffett dropped a bombshell:  
  
"We will NOT be selling any of those stocks. Not in decades, if ever."  
  
He's sitting on $20B in Japanese trading companies and wishes it was $100B instead.  
  
Size is now Berkshire's biggest enemy. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1919731463626674176/pl/X0Hm2ArQR6kzx_wH.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=a77&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1919731463626674176/vid/avc1/480x270/bk_d0ysT8-YXEB-F.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1919731463626674176/vid/avc1/640x360/rbecoLuEIDmppiKU.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1919731463626674176/vid/avc1/1280x720/1HKPLeIa9LzUKKcn.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

This billionaire predicted the 2008 crash when no one believed him.  
  
Now, Ray Dalio is warning that America faces an economic disaster that's worse than anything in 90 years.  
  
The terrifying part? It's already beginning to unfold.  
  
Here's what he says is coming next: 🧵

Ray Dalio built a $125 billion hedge fund.  
  
He predicted the 2008 crash before anyone else.  
  
After studying 500 years of economic cycles, he spotted a pattern that precedes every major collapse.  
  
This pattern just appeared for the first time since 1930... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918281848628899840/pl/JmMkjLfy0rR3HDBb.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=eff&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918281848628899840/vid/avc1/480x270/RXGaAQntdXfFsd2y.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918281848628899840/vid/avc1/640x360/ykcGSdjxFYI23t6D.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918281848628899840/vid/avc1/1280x720/DyEDrR33aJJCD_fZ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

His prediction? America is entering the final stage of a long-term debt cycle that ends badly for everyone.  
  
The last time this happened?  
  
The Great Depression...

The world's most feared investor.  
  
Paul Singer hasn't had a down year since 1977.  
  
His fund returned 14% annually for 46 years, going from managing $1.3 million to $72 billion through activist investing...  
  
Here are 8 of his best investing rules:  
(No. 6 is fascinating)

1/ Protect your capital at all costs.  
  
Singer lost 88% of his mother's $50,000 savings in the 1974 bear market.  
  
This is where his #1 principle came from.  
  
"When big losses happen, people lose their minds and judgment."  
  
Always protect the downside first. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915746639656214528/pl/H8PmTx7lDup3nE6d.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915746639656214528/vid/avc1/480x270/GhM6INOHja8_1505.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915746639656214528/vid/avc1/640x360/LRL4W0ELzzFLwxnF.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915746639656214528/vid/avc1/1280x720/WNeMkP1dKbHolCH0.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

2/ Seek uncorrelated returns.  
  
In 1977, Singer used convertible bond arbitrage, an underutilized strategy at the time.  
  
"We were long convertible bonds and short the underlying stock."  
  
This approach delivered steady returns regardless of market conditions. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915746709881438208/pl/2PVtQzbn_gb0XdBk.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915746709881438208/vid/avc1/480x270/XBz02L6D_SYw_qpf.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915746709881438208/vid/avc1/640x360/Ay0r2DTnI0E1YtH3.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915746709881438208/vid/avc1/1280x720/OknQz3yIU8d73hbW.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

The most powerful force in investing isn’t timing, diversification, or analysis.  
  
It’s patience.  
  
Chris Mayer studied every 100x stock since 1962, and found most people had already owned one… but sold.  
  
Here's a 12-part checklist for finding (and keeping) 100-baggers:

1/ The most important rule from analyzing 365 companies that returned 100X:  
  
Buy right, then hold on much longer than feels comfortable.  
  
Most investors sell winners way too early, missing 80-90% of potential gains.  
  
Time is your only real edge in the market.

2/ To find potential 100-baggers, prioritize HIGH SALES GROWTH.  
  
Great companies increase sales 20-30%+ annually for years.  
  
They're constantly expanding products, markets, or taking market share.  
  
Growth is the engine and without it, nothing else matters.

This man broke every investing rule.  
  
He bought 1,400 different stocks when experts like Buffett, Munger, and Graham said to focus on 20.  
  
Then he crushed the market by 29% yearly for 13 years straight.  
  
Here's how Peter Lynch's "bucket system" changed investing forever:🧵

1,400 stocks at once.  
  
That's not a typo.  
  
Lynch built from 60 to 1,400 stocks from 1977 to 1990, buying dozens in the same industry.  
  
Wall Street thought he had lost his mind. But he discovered something that would make him a legend...

Investors get stuck in three boxes:  
  
• Growth (high sales growth, low profit)  
• Value (cheap but declining companies)  
• Quality (earnings growing faster than sales)  
  
These labels make you miss 90% of good stocks.  
  
Lynch refused these rules. And invented his own strategy:
