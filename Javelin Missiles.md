From your notifications[Why doesn't Russia equip their tanks with APS or electronic warfare systems to repel Javelins and other ATGMs, which would significantly reduce their tank losses?](https://russiaandukraineconflict.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Russia-equip-their-tanks-with-APS-or-electronic-warfare-systems-to-repel-Javelins-and-other-ATGMs-which-wou)

Electronic warfare systems would not work on a Javelin. Electronic warfare equipment does things like jam radar signals. The Javelin works as follows: The shooter looks into the control device; it looks a bit like a video game and gets a tank into the sights of the electronic device. The shooter then zeros in on the tank in the video. The shooter then sends the information on the tank to the actual missile and fires the missile. The missile has all of its instructions inside of its computer system. The tank can move at top speed after the launch of the missile but the missile knows which tank to hit and it then tracks the tank by visual/video intelligence means. The missile then arches up in the sky and comes down for a top attack on the tank. The Javelin does not use radar signals and the missile does not have any radio contact with the control unit after launch. It is a, ‚Äúfire and forget system.‚Äù This is why the Javelin has a 95%+ kill ratio and also why each missile is close to $100,000.

Javelin has a more catchy name.

NLAWS are cheaper & smaller than Javelin, but significantly shorter range, 50%

This answer misses the point. First of all, APS systems are very effective against ATGM‚Äôs like Javelin. Our Trophy system (from the Israelis) works fine. Russia‚Äôs Arena system isn‚Äôt as good, but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot better than a cope cage. Forget ECM, the real question is the first part, why Russia‚Ä¶

The Russian army, the modern is not very large and the large is not modern.

It is my understanding APS systems are best suited for systems like TOW missiles. The Javelin acts differently, and can attack at just about any angle to attack the target. For the most part, active-protection systems are inadequate at countering top-attack munitions due to the increased angle of at‚Ä¶

There are a number of APS systems that claim to be effective vs top attacks, last time I surveyed them. Trophy definitely is one. It‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôd trust to deliver on its sales pitch.They‚Äôre also claimed effective against EFP cluster munitions delivered by artillery or aircraft, but I‚Äôm less certain how valid those claims are.(I‚Äôm certain Trophy can intercept Javelins, maybe air/artillery EFP‚Äôs. A few others perhaps Javelins but I doubt artillery. Most will not defend vs Javelins. But all will, for instance, destroy a top attack NLAW.) Note the problem here isn‚Äôt finding effectiveness claims, it‚Äôs knowing which to believe. üòõ Edit: I‚Äôm an EE, lead on a Raytheon doppler radar project, wrote one of the kernels for the Hellfire‚Äôs Longbow system, a SDI project or two. Retired. Not an expert. Familiar with the problem space though.Edit2: Larry, I just realized that I wrote above ‚ÄúAPS are very effective against ATGM‚Äôs like Javelin‚Äù - that‚Äôs obviously misleading. If I‚Äôd left off ‚Äú..like Javelin‚Äù, it‚Äôd be okay. But you‚Äôre correct, Javelins pose problems for most APS gear. My bad.

I used to be pro-Ukraine but now I‚Äôm coming around to Russia's point of view. This war could be over if Ukraine gave the Donbass to Russia as a buffer zone. Does anyone agree?

No. If Russia stops fighting and goes back to their own territory, the war is over; if Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine is over and life gets worse, not better, for those under Russian occupation.

Its impossible to agree with you since we know Putin‚Äôs demands for peace are greater than just Donbas. Putin wants Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea as well, even though of the 5 Oblasts he only has complete control of Crimea. Giving in to such demand would mean giving Russia territory they have never‚Ä¶
