On my " [REAL Banned Book List](https://www.anarchonomicon.com/p/the-anarchonomicon-real-banned-book) ", unlike Barnes and Noble's fake "banned" book tables, works of fiction very rarely appears.

School teachers might want children to believe short simple books readable by adolescents are "Banned" because Ooooüëª forbidden fruit, don't read the age appropriate short fiction the school librarian tells you to"..

But in reality 95+% of real banned books are non-fiction political tracts, censored histories, or terrorist manuals.

And the fiction books that are banned are usually fictionalized versions of those, works like "The Camp of the Saints", or "The Turner Diaries", despite their ability to move people emotionally are not banned for their emotional content but for their political content (and in the case of "The Turner Diaries" its accurate instructions on bomb making)

HOWEVER! There is one series that was driven from bookstores, and by the late 90s was almost totally disappeared based purely on the... "feelings"... it generated in its readers. A fantasy series set entirely on another world with more or less nothing to say about politics back on earth. It awakened... stirrings... in its readers so disturbing to the powers that be that it had to be stopped.

Captive of Gor (The Chronicles of Counter-Earth Volume 7) by Norman, John (Boris Vallejo, cover art) - 1982

***The Chronicles of GOR*** by John Norman (Pen-name of Philosophy Professor John Lange)

Begun in 1966 and continuing to... today (he's 92), the 38 book series is a Pulp Science Fantasy series in the vein of Edgar Rice Burroughs' "Barsoom" series (shout out to of

*[Postcards From Barsoom](https://open.substack.com/pub/barsoom)*

)

It has a lot of neat fantasy/historical/military hypotheticals to get the young male mind going "what if Vikings raided Japanese samurai cities with flying monsters?" but the thing that outraged the feminists and what they'd never admit enraged them, was its effect on female readers.

Norman has a lot of theories about sex... theories which his millions of books sold suggest are very true. Theories which recent DNA discoveries have confirmed.

.

At SEVERAL points in the genetic record you and nearly everyone on earth, have approximately 17 female ancestors for every 1 male ancestor.

This was of course the result of patriarchal warfare, polygamy, and sexual slavery... The kind familiar to any readers of the Iliad.

Indeed Norman cites Homer, Freud, and Nietzsche as the primary influences on his philosophy.

But whereas this produced the ancient and then modern warfighting boys and young men idolize from the Iliad, through Rome, to the Mongols, to the adventures and conquests of early modern Europe. And who's feuds and daring consume half the plot of Norman's stories...

The real controversy is what it produced of the women.

Women are natural slaves Norman tells and, after a slow as could be introduction, shows. (the first half of the first book drags)

While these periods of slaving warfare between peoples and tribes produced modern technical, competent, highly coordinated and cooperative man... In women it produced natural slaves. Women who'd long for the chain, women who'd desire nothing so much as to be owned and to submit to a powerful violent man not of their choosing... women who'd never feel so """empowered""" as when they obey, and surrender the spirits, bodies, and wombs which they cannot defend. Who'd never feel so loved and wanted as when they are abused and distained.

This is the world and theory of mind Norman paints with a philosopher's attention to completeness... 38 books deconstructing and undoing not only modern feminist ideas of equality, but Christian ideas of the equality of the soul and nobility of the feminine spirit. By any standard maybe the most sexist misogynistic books ever written, not out of ignorance or resentment but a philosopher's indifference to any social or ethical preening that might impede the truth...

And women freaking loved it.

The millions of copies Norman sold were matched only by the number of panties he ruined. Women formed entire BDSM communities and tried to recreate the experiences and dynamics from the novels, something that enrages left wing mainline BDSM communities since unlike their focus on "consent" and "empowerment" these women wanted to lose control completely and in some extreme cases: permanently!

Women surrendering all authority over their bodies, finances, and social existence to their husbands on a 24/7 basis, they hoped, never to be returned... and what really offended the Left-BDSM types: they were openly claiming it was because they were lesser and that that was their role in existence. What they were born to be. All they could ever be.

Feminists reacted with perhaps the greatest display of Cope and Seethe in literary history.

Consummately refusing to acknowledge or accept that Norman's audience was well beyond 50% female (men read it for the war and there's tons of books on that) feminists started campaigns insisting that Norman's audience was entirely male abusers and misogynists. The few innocent readers: naive young impressionable boys who needed to be taught not to rape, but were being taught the opposite.

Of course Norman had merely written the type of violently sexual romances that had been staples of harlequin romances and women's lit for decades if not centuries... on paper he'd just made the war scenes more realistic and engaging‚Ä¶ you know, aside from the fantasy fortresses and rideable giant birds.

But he did something 30s romance writers like Margaret Mitchell, and now tens of thousands of romance, erotica, and fanfic authors never did in all their sexy violent stories... Something the feminists could never forgive him for. Sandwiched between the fighting and the fornication, he explained with a philosopher's exactness WHY those stories are sexy.

Amidst the pulp adventures, wars on an alien worlds, and sexy slavery, Norman lays out a comprehensive theory of human sexuality utterly incompatible with feminism, "Democracy", equality, and possibly even Christian civilization.

He summoned the primordial lusts and hungers from the cruel ages of humanity into the hearts and souls of his readers, and he told them the names of those lusts such that they could never forget them, nor could they ever look upon the egalitarian world world around them with anything but boredom and disdain.

In short: It's pretty hot.
