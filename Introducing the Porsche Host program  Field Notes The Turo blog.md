### Get the ultimate Porsche experience on Turo

Today, I am very proud to introduce the Porsche Host pilot program with Porsche Digital, Inc. designed to bring you the ultimate Porsche experience on Turo. This program combines the exclusivity of the world’s premier sports car maker with the accessibility of top Turo hosts for a special opportunity that will launch on October 8.

The Porsche Host program offers a complete Porsche experience available to customers just short of owning a Porsche model. This is a new way to experience the thrill of driving a Porsche, providing on-demand access to some of the finest Porsche vehicles on Turo, shared by some of the most outstanding hosts in the San Francisco and Los Angeles Turo communities.

This relationship is an amazing opportunity to enhance Porsche trips on Turo and to engage with a massive group of enthusiasts in our marketplace. As a lifelong Porsche enthusiast myself, I have personally enjoyed the experience of handing over the keys of [my 911](https://turo.com/rentals/cars/ca/hillsborough/porsche-911/279) to Porsche connoisseurs.

When you book with Porsche Hosts, you gain enhanced service and access to some of the most exciting automobiles on the market. The Turo hosts participating in the pilot were chosen for their knowledge and passion as Porsche owners. Besides their veteran status and five-star track records on Turo, all Porsche Hosts were vetted, educated, and trained by Porsche at the Porsche Experience Center in Los Angeles to talk you through every feature of their vehicle.

The Porsche Host program features some of our highest-quality vehicles on offer — all participating Porsche vehicles were inspected at an authorized Porsche dealership before being selected for the program. Guests can choose from models across the Porsche lineup, from the iconic Porsche 911 Carrera to the focused Porsche 718 Cayman to the spacious Porsche Cayenne.

During your trip in a Porsche from a Porsche Host, you also have the peace of mind knowing that Porsche is there for you. Guests have instant access to Porsche Roadside Assist, which provides vehicle support should something happen on the road. If you’ve got a flat, they’ve got your back.

Perhaps the most exciting part of the Porsche Host program is that it gives guests who don’t necessarily own a Porsche the chance to live out their Porsche dream to the fullest extent. Unsurprisingly, Porsche is among the most-searched makes across the Turo marketplace. People come to Turo to fulfill their fantasies of driving their dream car, because nowhere else can you have a personalized and verified extended test drive in the exact car of your choosing.

We’re thrilled to be working with Porsche to continue exploring the changing ways enthusiasts access and experience cars. The Porsche Host program blends elite Turo hosts and comprehensive service with some of world’s finest sports cars.
