In My Misanthropy Era — LessWrong

[^1]: This was not precisely true. Some were definitely running all their thoughts through a filter of "were these claims potentially problematic or exclusionary to minority groups?" This is a fine filter, I just wish there were other filters being used too.

[^2]: Actually, it was worse than that. I was trying to prove to myself that the dead white aristocrats weren't correct about their peasant stock, but I felt backed into a corner by coming into contact with other members of the petit bourgeois 🤡

[^3]: Well, at least not for protagonists, but I suppose I can't rule out the possibility that I'm here as some sort of scintillatingly flawed side character that's going to get their thematically appropriate comeuppance in like 7 chapters' time.
