## An Exclusive Series

**Beretta 1301 Tactical**

The enhanced Beretta 1301 Tactical is the newest iteration of Beretta's premier law enforcement and home-defense semi-automatic shotgun series. Engineered to be ultra-reliable and easy to use, this modern tactical shotgun features enlarged controls, a cold hammer-forged, back-bored barrel, and Beretta's ultrafast BLINK gas operating system with a cross tube gas piston that allows for 36% faster cycling than its competition.  
  
  
Right out of the box, the new 1301 features an oversized charging handle, a large highly textured bolt release, and an oversized reversible safety button. These features make it easy to use in all weather or lighting conditions as your hands will always be able to positively and safely grip it and operate the controls. Also, the aggressive checkering on the forend makes it easy to gain a secure grip even while wearing gloves.  
  
  
The 1301 Tactical features a robust, protected ghost-ring system with an interchangeable front sight, which gives the user the opportunity to adapt it to any use - no matter the conditions. An interchangeable choke system allows for maximum flexibility based on use and needs. An OptimaBore HP Improved Cylinder (flush configuration) is included with this package as well as a factory 7+1 capacity one-piece magazine tube (with correct 2.75" shells - certain shells may be beyond 2.75" in OAL and will reduce capacity to 6+1).  
  
  
The stock is adjustable for length-of-pull with provided spacers to ensure that it will always come up naturally to your shoulder and point easily. Drop and cast are adjustable as well. For additional customization, the receiver offers an aircraft-grade, aluminum MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail that makes it easy to add optics with modifications to the shotgun.  
  

This enhanced tactical shotgun features a cold hammer-forged, back-bored barrel that dissipates recoil away from the shooter's hand and greatly reduces muzzle flip.

Mag Capacity

Have not fired yet, but test loaded some different buckshot rounds only. The magazine tube will only allow 6+1, if you really force it, you ghost load to 7+1, which I do not want to do during an actual emergency. From what I've read on this issue is that it may carry 7 in the tube but it depends on what you use, buckshot wise. I believe the crimping on the rds is an additional issue for packing 7. I also read that since this gun is euro made, the 7 rds are for euro style ammo, not american in terms of 2 3/4"". I purchased this gun with the major factor of it fitting 7+1, not 6. This fix, which is simple, but i am not comfortable with is to remove the plastic cap on the end of the tube that is internal to the tube covering. Keep this cap removed, then install the tube cover back on which will hold the tube spring in place. Highly disappointed that a prestigious company like beretta would do this. They can EASILY add to the accessories an extended plastic cap and cover to properly fit 7.

stock up grade

Got the tactical with out the pistol grip last night. This morning I ordered the Mesa tactical stock and pistol grip kit. Came with spring and hydraulic recoil reducer that goes in the buffer tube and the stock is a magpul AR style 6 position adjustable slider. claimed to reduce up to 80% of the recoil. This should be a fun upgrade
