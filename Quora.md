I know, I know, pick me. Soil specialist here. Firstly, have you noticed that all waves reaching any island go toward the beach no matter which side of the island you are? How is that possible if the wind is blowing in a certain direction? I quote Scuba Geek: “ As a wave crest approaches a circular island that has uniformly sloping shores, the part of it that enters shallow water first begins to slow down while the rest of it continues. As more parts of the crest progressively slow down, the crest line curves towards the shore and eventually lines up parallel to it. This happens all the way around the island, as shown in the figure below. Note that the crest lines bending around opposite sides of the island eventually cross, so if conditions are right you should be able to see crests passing through each other at right angles. The bending of water waves by a sloping bottom is known as refraction, and is analogous to the bending of light waves as they pass from a medium where they have a high speed (air) to one where they have a low speed (water)”. Thus around an island water always hit the beach towards land. Then, water retreats pushing and pulling underwater sand or loose soil perpendicular to land. Secondly, the rest angle of sand is well know: when sand is on an incline, the friction between grains tend to make them immobile, while gravity pulls them towards the bottom of the incline. Thus, sand in a heap is in equilibrium. A heap of sand, root of Sorites paradox and also of Coulomb rest angle The angle between horizontal and the heap slope is constant Thirdly, under water, sand weighs less, by Archimedes principle. On land, sand weighs around 2.2 tons per cubic meter. Under water, sand weighs only 1.2 tons per cubic meter, give or take, because you have to “discount” the weight of water the sand displaces. Moreover, water lubricates the sand grains in a way air doesn’t. Thus, under water sand weigh less, friction is even less and the angles that sand can do are different from on land. Sand rest angle is way shallower at the edge of the sea or under the sea. Rest angle of sand on the dry portion of the beach is way larger… … than rest angle under the sea… … and even at the wet portion of the beach, we all have noticed most beaches are quite flat Finally, after this explanation it should be clear to you that any material you throw into the sea, is sooner or later lost to the sea by the inexorables: law of refraction, that bends the waves toward the beach law of Archimedes, that makes rocks and sands under the sea to weigh less and law of Coulomb that explains how the sand angles are constant around the water front when conditions are equal. The only way soil specialists and engineers have found is to pump sand continuously or to increase dramatically the angle of repose using tetrapods, which are like the old Jax game: Vintage Jax game Tetrapods to “extend the land many metres into the sea” are like concrete-made giant heavy Jax tokens Of course you can also use a dike. If Dutch people does it is for something. Ancient Dutch dikes, keep the water out of the soil, instead of throwing soil into the water Modern Dutch dike, notice the area with the concrete barrier made of so-called Bermblocks plus the barge and dredge actually throwing sand into the sea (thanks to Peter Dunlop for correcting me, I thought it was actually taking sand out of the bottom) on the far side of the image What you do is to build berms at the edge on dry land like the one of the previous picture, using the giant concrete blocks you see and fixing the top with the grass shown. Bermblocks explained Literally, as the Bible says, Matthew, 7: 24 “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”
