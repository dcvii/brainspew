After more than a decade together at [Kraft Heinz](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KHC) [KHC \-5.74% decrease; red down pointing triangle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KHC), ketchup is breaking up with hot dogs.

The food giant said it plans to split its business into two companies, unwinding an industry megamerger that married two packaged-food behemoths.

In the breakup, one global company would focus on sauces, spreads and seasonings, while another would sell grocery staples in North America. The move aims to create businesses with more focus and less complexity, Kraft Heinz said, and deepens a reversal of the food industry’s yearslong strategy of pursuing deals to build scale.

“Scale by itself is not the answer, but having scale along with focus creates opportunities,” said Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Carlos Abrams-Rivera in an interview.

Abrams-Rivera will head the $10 billion North America grocery business, which will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The other business, one with roughly $15 billion in annual sales, will focus globally on “taste elevation” with brands including Heinz ketchup, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, the company said.

The transaction undoes much of the work done from the much-maligned merger of Kraft and Heinz in 2015, a deal arranged by and Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital Partners.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the company was [closing in on a plan](https://www.wsj.com/business/kraft-heinz-break-up-deal-346ee8f5?mod=article_inline) to break itself up. The Journal [reported in July](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/kraft-heinz-split-3e75294e?mod=article_inline) that Kraft Heinz was planning to spin off a large chunk of its grocery business.

The division comes as corporate breakups are coming into vogue in the food and beverage industry. [Kellogg](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/K) in 2023 split into two companies, a [snack giant named Kellanova](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kelloggs-snack-company-gets-new-latin-inspired-name-kellanova-eca55c7f?mod=article_inline) and a North American [cereal business called WK Kellogg](https://www.wsj.com/business/food-companies-maha-kellogg-987d3915?mod=article_inline). [Keurig Dr Pepper](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KDP) is [unwinding a 2018 transaction](https://www.wsj.com/business/keurig-dr-pepper-near-18-billion-deal-for-jde-peets-33883fe4?mod=article_inline) that had united a coffee maker and beverage company under the same roof.

Kraft Heinz has struggled in recent years as demand for some of its core products—including Lunchables, Capri Sun, macaroni and cheese, and mayonnaise—has weakened. The company has been working to reshuffle its portfolio and [invest in healthier products](https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/food-cooking/kraft-heinzs-ceo-is-a-health-nut-can-he-remake-a-processed-food-giant-6b072042?mod=article_inline) that are more in line with [consumers’ changing preferences](https://www.wsj.com/science/biology/healthier-sugar-fiber-enzyme-harvard-scientists-a8bb2dce?mod=article_inline).

In July, Kraft Heinz [posted a loss](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/kraft-heinz-swings-to-loss-on-impairment-charge-as-sales-fall-again-840a8ed2?mod=article_inline) for its second quarter, hurt by a $9.3 billion noncash impairment charge that it said was largely driven by a sustained decline in its share price and market capitalization.

Kraft Heinz shares have fallen about 21% over the past year, slumping further than an S&P index tracking packaged food and meat companies. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has gained about 14%.

To boost sales, Kraft Heinz has recently taken steps like [offering a larger box of macaroni and cheese](https://www.wsj.com/business/kraft-heinz-evaluating-strategic-transactions-berkshire-hathaway-steps-away-from-board-0cbadc13?mod=article_inline) that can feed a family of five for less than $2, and using better cookies and crackers in Lunchables. The company said in July that it expects its costs to rise between 5% and 7% this year, but that it is only passing a portion of that on to consumers.

Abrams-Rivera said that the complexity of Kraft Heinz’s business has hampered the company. The conglomerate’s nearly 200 brands stretch across some 55 categories and 150 countries, the CEO said, making it difficult to fully invest in each of them. The separation will enable executives at the North America staples business, which will include brands from Capri Sun to Cool Whip, to focus on a smaller geography, and work to expand into channels like convenience stores that they haven’t yet prioritized.

“We can allocate the right level of attention and resources to unlock the potential of each brand to drive better performance,” said Miguel Patricio, executive chair of Kraft Heinz.

Kraft Heinz said it expects to complete the split in the second half of 2026. The company said its board is working to identify potential candidates to lead its global business. Kraft Heinz said it has no plans to change the locations of its current headquarters in Pittsburgh and Chicago.

TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow said that food megamergers have had low success rates. Moskow said that the skills and investments required to prevail in different parts of the grocery store often vary, and that companies with narrower portfolios are more likely to be successful in the long run than diversified ones.

“Food companies have found that their breadth of influence in the grocery store does not necessarily yield the advantages they expected,” Moskow said.

Splitting Kraft Heinz into two companies, however, could be complicated. Moskow said that Kraft Heinz has worked to create a business-wide operating framework, and developed partnerships with [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) and Google that it will have to disentangle. Years ago, 3G also closed manufacturing facilities and consolidated distribution centers, Moskow said.
