Children performing the Bellamy salute to the flag of the United States, 1941

The **Bellamy salute** is a straightened hand and palm-down [salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salute "Salute") to the [flag of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States "Flag of the United States"). Created by James B. Upham as the gesture that was to accompany the [Pledge of Allegiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance "Pledge of Allegiance") of the United States of America, whose text had been written by [Francis Bellamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bellamy "Francis Bellamy"), it was known as the *flag salute* during the period when it was used, from 1892 to 1942, with the Pledge of Allegiance. Bellamy promoted the salute and thus it was retroactively renamed after him.

Later, during the 1920s and 1930s, [Italian Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism "Italian fascism") and [German Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism") in Europe adopted [a similar salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute "Nazi salute") that also resembled the [Roman salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute "Roman salute"), a gesture attributed to [ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome"). The introduction of the Nazi salute resulted in controversy over the use of the Bellamy salute in the United States, especially once the country entered the [European theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_theatre_of_World_War_II "European theatre of World War II") of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") after Germany and Italy [declared war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war") against the United States.[^1] The Bellamy salute was replaced with saluting the flag by placing the right hand over the heart when [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") amended the [*Flag Code*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Flag_Code "United States Flag Code") on December 22, 1942.

## History

The inventor of the Bellamy salute was James B. Upham, junior partner and editor of *[The Youth's Companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Youth%27s_Companion "The Youth's Companion")*.[^2] Bellamy recalled that Upham, upon reading the pledge, came into the posture of the salute, snapped his heels together, and said, "Now up there is the flag; I come to salute; as I say 'I pledge allegiance to my flag', I stretch out my right hand and keep it raised while I say the stirring words that follow." [^2] By the time the official program was published, the Bellamy salute would begin with a traditional military salute as the first words of the pledge were spoken.

The Bellamy salute was first demonstrated on October 21, 1892, according to Bellamy's published instructions for the "National School Celebration of [Columbus Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day "Columbus Day") " as the *400th Anniversary of the Discovery of America*. Note, the Presidential Proclamation called for this special, national holiday to take place on Friday, October 21, rather than October 12. Waiting nine additional days accounted for all but two of the days which had been skipped in 1752 moving the United States [from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_of_the_Gregorian_calendar "Adoption of the Gregorian calendar"). The goal was to mark a full 400 years passing with a true work holiday, thus avoiding events falling on Saturday/Sunday. With an already established tradition celebrating Columbus's having landed on October 12, New York City opted to schedule three special parades and several VIP celebrations with their events taking place on October 11, 12 and 13, 1892.

From *The Official Programme* regarding the planned flag salute:

> At a signal from the Principal the pupils, in ordered ranks, hands to the side, face the Flag. Another signal is given; every pupil gives the flag the military salute – right hand lifted, palm downward, to align with the forehead and close to it. Standing thus, all repeat together, slowly, "I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands; one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all." At the words, "to my Flag", the right hand is extended gracefully, palm upward, toward the Flag, and remains in this gesture till the end of the affirmation; whereupon all hands immediately drop to the side.

—  *The Youth's Companion*, 65 (1892): 446.

In the 1920s, [Italian fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism "Italian fascism") adopted the [Roman salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute "Roman salute") to symbolize their claim to have revitalized Italy on the model of ancient Rome. A similar ritual was adopted by the German [Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party "Nazi Party"), creating the [Nazi salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute "Nazi salute"). Controversy grew in the United States on the use of the Bellamy salute given its similarity to the fascist salutes. School boards around the country revised the salute to avoid this similarity. There was a counter-backlash from the [United States Flag Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Flag_Association "American Flag Association") and the [Daughters of the American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_of_the_American_Revolution "Daughters of the American Revolution"), who felt it inappropriate for Americans to have to change the traditional salute because foreigners had later adopted a similar gesture.[^3]

From 1939 until the [attack on Pearl Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor "Attack on Pearl Harbor"), critics of [Americans who argued against intervention in World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_Committee "America First Committee") produced propaganda using the salute to lessen those Americans' reputations. Among the anti-interventionist Americans was aviation pioneer [Charles Lindbergh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh "Charles Lindbergh"). The pictures of him appearing to do the Nazi salute are actually pictures of him using the Bellamy salute.[^4] In his [Pulitzer Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize "Pulitzer Prize") -winning biography [*Lindbergh*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbergh_\(book\) "Lindbergh (book)") (1998), author [A. Scott Berg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Scott_Berg "A. Scott Berg") explains that [interventionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventionism_\(politics\) "Interventionism (politics)") propagandists would photograph Lindbergh and other [isolationists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationists "Isolationists") using this salute from an angle that left out the [American flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_flag "American flag"), so it would be indistinguishable to observers from the Nazi salute.

On June 22, 1942, at the urging of the [American Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legion "American Legion") and the [Veterans of Foreign Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_of_Foreign_Wars "Veterans of Foreign Wars"), Congress passed [Public Law 77-623](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public_Law_77-623 "s:Public Law 77-623"), which codified the etiquette used to display and pledge allegiance to the flag. This included the use of a palm-out salute, specifically that the pledge "be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart; extending the right hand, palm upward, toward the flag at the words 'to the flag' and holding this position until the end, when the hand drops to the side." Congress did not discuss or take into account the controversy over use of the salute. Congress later amended the code on December 22, 1942, when it passed [Public Law 77-829](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public_Law_77-829 "s:Public Law 77-829"), stating among other changes, that the pledge "be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart."
