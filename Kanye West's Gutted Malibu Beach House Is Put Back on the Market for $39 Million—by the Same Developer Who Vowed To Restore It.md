A Malibu beach house that [disgraced rapper **Kanye West** bought](https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/kanye-wests-malibu-home-finds-buyer/), gutted, and abandoned has been put back on the market for $39 million—seven months after a [developer snapped it up for $21 million](https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/kanye-west-malibu-mansion-buyer-revealed/), vowing to restore it to its former glory.

[West, 47, had purchased the iconic home](https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/kanye-west-malibu-house-fires-survives/) in 2021 for a whopping $57.25 million. He then gutted the property, which was designed by  [Pritzker Prize-winning architect **Tadao Ando**](https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/who-is-tadao-ando/), reportedly in the hopes of turning it into a modernist bomb shelter.

However, the musician abandoned his plans shortly after tearing the home apart, leaving it empty and exposed to the elements, drawing furious backlash from architecture lovers.

He went on to list the gutted home for an eye-watering $53 million in January 2024, before ultimately accepting an offer for less than half of that amount from **[Steve "Bo" Belmont](https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/buyer-closes-on-kanye-wests-gutted-malibu-mansion/)**, CEO of "real estate crowdfunding firm" Belwood Investments.

When he bought the home, Belmont announced in a press release that he planned to spend $5 million restoring Ando's work. The purchase of the property provided "an opportunity to revitalize and preserve an architectural gem... ensuring it remains a jewel of Malibu," he noted.

Yet Belmont has now thrown something of a curveball, choosing to [relist the home](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/M1430941561) with an asking price of $39 million, despite the fact that the description notes that "all interior finishes have been removed from the property" and that "work is needed to either restore or reimagine the interiors" before they can be lived in.

Speaking to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/kanye-west-malibu-mansion-0debdbcf?mod=panda_wsj_custom_topic_alert), Belmont insisted that his decision to put the four-bedroom, five-bathroom beach house on the market does not mean that he plans to abandon the construction that is already underway.

He will continue with the work until he receives an offer that he believes is fair, he explained.

He then proceeded to gut the property from top to bottom, reportedly with the aim of turning it into a modernist bomb shelter.(Realtor.com)

Should he not secure an offer close to his $39 million ask before the restoration of the house is finished, he will continue with the work and then relist the home for between $55 million and $65 million when it is closer to completion. He said he estimates that the project will likely be completed in early 2026.

He told the outlet that he has already had several offers on the home over the past few months—one for $30 million from a Montana-based developer and another for $28 million from a local builder—but believed they were too low.

"I'm obviously not going to take that," he said. "But there's been a lot of activity."

Still, he believes that selling the home in its current state for the lower price would still earn the same profit than if he waited until the work was done.

The carrying costs on the property are currently about $1 million a month, he told the Journal.

Having initially said that he would invest $5 million toward the restoration of the home, he now estimates the total cost to be about $8.5 million.

Belmont has made a good amount of headway, noting that he has thus far installed new plumbing and electric, restored the roof, and completed all of the framing. The glass for the windows is expected to arrive from Germany before the end of summer.

Interestingly, Belmont has opted to team up with celebrity real estate agent **Jason Oppenheim** on the listing—the same person who sold him the property.

Speaking about the new listing, Oppenheim said that buying the home while it is still something of a blank canvas will enable a new owner to take control over certain elements of the design.

"This house is like a Picasso," he said. "This is almost like allowing the buyer to pick the frame."

Belmont noted that the property's value has been "bolstered" as a result of a lack of inventory caused by the California wildfires. (Realtor.com)

Additionally, Belmont believes that the damage wrought by the California wildfires, which destroyed multiple properties in the Malibu area, particularly along the Pacific Coast Highway, has "bolstered \[the\] value" of the Ando-designed home.

"To be quite frank, there's no inventory to buy on the Pacific Coast Highway, so it really bolstered our value," he said, although he noted that the wildfires were a "horrible thing."

Belmont made headlines around the world when he announced that he had bought West's former home, while opening up about how he launched his real estate career as a side hustle while serving three years in prison for assault with a deadly weapon.

At the time, the Malibu property purchase represented the largest that Belmont's company had ever made—and looked to become the most complex and expensive restoration that it would complete.

The original home, which was built in 2013, having been commissioned by its first owner, **Richard Sachs**, was made out of 1,200 tons of concrete and 200 tons of reinforced steel, which were combined to create an ultramodern 4,000-square-foot abode.

It was built atop sand, supported by 12 massive caissons driven 60 feet into the bedrock.

The minimalist home features open spaces, ocean views, and indoor-outdoor living areas.

Belmont previously told [Realtor.com®](http://realtor.com/) that the company targets luxury real estate and this house “fits all of our criteria.”

“This is a relatively easy project in comparison to our other projects,” he said. “Length of time is 12 to 14 months with a cost projection between $6 million and $8 million.”

Belmont noted that he was not daunted by the state of the home because it was “built stronger than anything I’ve ever seen. We basically just have to put it back together again. The first thing that I plan on doing is starting the construction with the original builders for Richard Sachs.”

He noted that he would be teaming up with architecture firm Marmol Radziner, which worked on the initial build of the house in 2013.

The original plan, he said, was to pour millions into renovations to restore the property and then flip it for a profit for his investors—admitting that he was aiming for a 100% return on the home.
