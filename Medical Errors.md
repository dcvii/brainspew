A study by Johns Hopkins Medicine suggests that medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States, claiming over 250,000 lives annually. The study highlights the need for better reporting of these errors and reforms in how death statistics are collected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently overlooks medical errors as a leading cause of death, focusing only on the initial condition that led to treatment. The Johns Hopkins team proposes adding a question on death certificates to identify preventable medical complications. To prevent medical errors, individuals can educate themselves, keep detailed medical records, communicate effectively with healthcare providers, double-check prescriptions and treatments, and have a trusted person present during critical care. These steps can help improve patient safety and prevent unnecessary deaths.

Researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine have released a newsworthy study asserting that medical errors should be recognized as the third leading cause of death in the United States. The study, led by Dr. Martin Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon, sheds light on the severe underreporting of fatalities due to medical mistakes and suggests significant reforms in how death statistics are collected and recorded.

According to the study’s findings, medical errors claim over 250,000 American lives annually. This staggering number places it just behind heart disease and cancer, each responsible for around 600,000 deaths, and well ahead of respiratory diseases, which account for approximately 150,000 deaths per year. 

The analysis, published in the BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal, calls into question the accuracy of national health priorities that currently overlook medical errors as a leading cause of death. Dr. Makary and his team argue that the way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects and codes death certificate data is fundamentally flawed. 

The current system fails to capture critical errors such as diagnostic mistakes, poor judgments, and communication breakdowns that can be fatal. “You have this over-appreciation of diseases like cardiovascular disease, and a vast under-recognition of medical care as a cause of death,” Dr. Makary stated, emphasizing how this discrepancy influences health priorities and research funding in the country.

The CDC counters this claim, with Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch, pointing out that medical complications are noted on death certificates and that their coding does capture such instances. 

However, the CDC’s approach focuses solely on the “underlying cause of death”—the initial condition leading to medical treatment. Consequently, even if medical errors are listed on a death certificate, they are excluded from national mortality statistics, overshadowed by the primary medical condition, regardless of its fatality.

This method, according to Anderson, aligns with international standards, facilitating comparisons with global health data. He expressed that changing this system would require compelling reasons, underscoring the complexities involved in overhauling established protocols.

The Johns Hopkins team advocates for the addition of a specific question on death certificates to identify whether a preventable medical complication contributed to the death. This proposal aims to better quantify the true impact of medical errors, thereby increasing public awareness and research investment in this critical area of healthcare.

The suggestion, however, is met with skepticism regarding its feasibility. Anderson remarked on the discomfort doctors might feel in reporting a death as a medical error, arguing that simply adding a checkbox might not address the deeper issue of underreporting. Instead, he advocates for enhanced education for doctors on the importance of error reporting as a vital public health measure.

Being a better advocate to guard against medical errors is crucial, not only for your own health but also for the well-being of others who may be in a vulnerable position in a healthcare setting. Here are five effective ways to enhance your advocacy skills. These steps can significantly improve your ability to prevent medical errors and advocate effectively for yourself or others:

**Educate Yourself and Stay Informed:** Understanding common medical procedures, medications, and potential side effects can help you recognize when something might be amiss. Keep up with the latest healthcare information and standards. This knowledge helps you to ask informed questions and understand the answers.

**Keep Detailed Medical Records**: Maintain accurate and up-to-date personal health records, including a list of all medications (prescription and over-the-counter), allergies, past surgeries, and significant medical history. Having this information readily available can be crucial in emergencies and helps ensure continuity of care.

**Communicate Effectively with Healthcare Providers**: Establish open and respectful communication with doctors, nurses, and other healthcare staff. Don’t hesitate to discuss your concerns, ask for clarifications about treatments or medications, and mention any changes in symptoms or new symptoms. Effective communication can prevent misunderstandings and errors.

**Double-Check Prescriptions and Treatments:** Always verify new prescriptions, including the drug name, dosage, and the intended use—ask why it’s being prescribed and its potential side effects. For treatments and procedures, understand what is to be done and why. If something doesn’t seem right, don’t hesitate to confirm or seek a second opinion.

**Advocate for Trusted Presence During Critical Care:** Whenever possible, have a trusted family member or friend accompany you during major medical appointments or stays in the hospital. A second set of eyes and ears can help catch errors, remember medical advice, and advocate on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself.
