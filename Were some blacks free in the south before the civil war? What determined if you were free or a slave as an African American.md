Yes. My mother’s side of the family. Never were slaves. About a third of the family could pass for white. My DNA says I’m 1/8 French. I knew none of this growing up. It didn’t make a difference to me, but now I know. My mother and aunt are both in this picture with their friends from the neighborhood where they grew up - Lafitte Projects \[ 1 \]. My mother is the one wearing a pendant. What made the determination? Don’t know. I suppose you just knew none of your ancestors were. Interesting question. Footnotes Lafitte Projects - Wikipedia
