As an FBI agent for nearly 20 years, Pat McMonigle investigated national security crimes, was a hostage negotiator and [Joint Terrorism Task Force](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism/joint-terrorism-task-forces) coordinator, trained dozens of other special agents, and was deployed three times to war zones overseas. But it was his investigation of an online cult fueled by an insidious, unspeakably evil ideology that led to the end of his law enforcement career.

That ideology is called 764, an online neo-Nazi group grounded in a nihilism and a perverse form of [social Darwinism](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/social-darwinism-and-racism) which encourages vulnerable young kids to release sexually explicit material, hurt themselves, and even commit suicide. And it is that ideology that the shooter at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, Robin Westman, appears to have subscribed to based on the killer’s writings and activity online.

Westman appears to [have supported](https://www.thefp.com/p/robin-westman-and-the-rise-of-american-nihilism-minneapolis-shooting) the Order of Nine Angles, a Satanic right-wing group with ties to 764, though authorities haven’t yet confirmed this connection.

The investigation by McMonigle began in 2022 and involved a 13-year-old who was manipulated and coerced into committing suicide, and recording it, by an online groomer and leader of 764. McMonigle said over the course of the investigation, he was forced to watch videos of dozens of kids being coerced into physically harming themselves, including watching the video of the 13-year-old child’s suicide at least half a dozen times.

This summer the German [police finally arrested](https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/17/german-prosecutors-investigate-additional-victims-in-hamburg-child-suicide-network-case) one of the [suspected leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/18/germany-murder-764-online-predators/) of 764, a 20-year-old man living in his parents’ home in Hamburg who went by “White Tiger.” He was charged with 123 counts, including the murder of the 13-year-old child at the center of McMonigle’s case.

McMonigle told me he felt an incredible sense of relief after the arrest, but he’s still left with irreparable scars. The horror of working on the case left him with debilitating PTSD, a battle [he described](https://www.thefp.com/p/fbi-veteran-pat-mcmonigle-ptsd-kash-patel) earlier this year in *The Free Press*.

I called McMonigle in the aftermath of this week’s mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School to ask him about how and why nihilistic ideology is infecting young people around the world, how easily it can spread, and what we can do to fight it.

Below is an edited version of our conversation.

**Frannie Block**:The FBI and Justice Department have created a new classification of criminal called Nihilistic Violent Extremist, or NVE. Two of the suspected leaders of 764 were arrested in April. Those were among the first arrests of such alleged criminals. There are at least [250 other investigations](https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-opened-250-investigations-tied-violent-online-network/story?id=121480884) into this type of violence and extremism. What is behind its rise?

**Pat McMonigle**: The shooter in Minnesota fit the profile of this new threat of Nihilistic Violent Extremists to a T. These are people who are already suicidal. They have grievances and problems with everybody—neo-Nazism, antisemitism, really all of the most hateful ideologies you can think of. They believe in a worldview that doesn’t make sense to a rational mind. These are people who have dropped out of regular society, and they are really attached to the internet—so much so that they basically live out most of their life online. They idolize other killers and mass shooters and seek to emulate their tactics. You can tell they are really sick, mentally disturbed people.

This nihilistic extremism that is so prevalent online also opens up opportunities for predators, like White Tiger, the 764 leader arrested in Germany. To them, the internet is becoming their playground. It’s now a world supercharged with violent imagery that kids are viewing, and they are becoming desensitized to it. And I think it’s just motivating these groups that are already operating on the fringes of society. To them, killing becomes trivial. I always thought that White Tiger saw his victims as points in a video game. He had to dehumanize his victims in order to justify hurting them. And that’s exactly how people’s minds get warped online to perpetrate violence. They can no longer see others as human.

“When I signed up to work in the FBI, I expected to be fighting terrorists whose ideologies were known and who were waging a war against the U.S. and the West. But these faceless people online to me were more than terrorists.” —Pat McMonigle

You have to stop these people. My biggest fear in investigating these groups was always how they would escalate their tactics—like what we might have seen unfold in Minneapolis. They will continue to kill more kids, and what are they going to become if they continue to grow?

**FB**: How do these groups operate? Where do they hide, and how do they find their victims?

**PM**: These online sadistic cults operate somewhat independently, but they have a loose affiliation with each other online through sharing child sexual abuse material.

They find their victims by determining who is most vulnerable. These people prey on children in online chat rooms often dedicated to self-help and mental illnesses. And we have such a problem with mental health and depression among kids that there are unfortunately ample opportunities for these predators to find new victims.

They then lure kids out of those chat rooms onto other platforms, where they begin to manipulate them and coerce them into hurting themselves. It acts as a form of harming their victims and recruiting new members. They believe that kids who are susceptible to their manipulation—meaning that they hurt themselves—are weak, and those who aren’t are strong enough to join the movement. It’s a manifestation of their sick form of social Darwinism.

**FB:** What’s your understanding of how the FBI is tackling this problem? What are the obstacles to pursuing these cases?

**PM**: My understanding is that finally the FBI is taking this seriously. And I know that they’ve dedicated entire squads to these investigations and they’ve now recognized these online groups are a form of domestic terrorism.

The first hurdle in investigating these cases is recognizing when there are ties leading back to these online groups. In many cases, children will harm themselves or commit suicide but investigators will not think to look at their ties to online chat rooms. In reality, it is unknown how widespread this problem is.

I can only imagine that the real number, sadly, is massive, because when you do begin to investigate, you start to uncover so many victims. And one of the rules in the FBI is once you encounter a victim, you have to pause the broader investigation to do everything you can to identify this person and then alert the proper local authorities. And so it becomes really cumbersome. And logistically these are not easy cases to investigate—it’s hard to go undercover and catch people in the act. These investigations also become extremely technical very quickly because these criminals are adept at encrypting their communications and obfuscating their true identities.

**FB**: You’ve experienced multiple forms of trauma. What about investigating 764 brought you almost to the point of breaking?

**PM**: For me, it really was just the pure evil of it. And the case that nearly broke me felt so close to home. It occurred in my hometown. I had kids who were the same age as the victims for whom I was trying to get justice.

When I signed up to work in the FBI, I expected to be fighting terrorists whose ideologies were known and who were waging a war against the U.S. and the West. But these faceless people online to me were more than terrorists. They were evil demons who were going after the most vulnerable kids. Every day that I investigated these cases, I felt like I could never win, never make any advances against such evil. It became too difficult for me to handle.

“Young people today are dealing with a crisis of purpose. They’ve lost sight of the big things to live for anymore, including not having religion.” —Pat McMonigle

**FB**: What about our society today do you think has allowed these nihilistic ideologies to take hold, especially among young people?

**PM**: Young people today are dealing with a crisis of purpose. They’ve lost sight of the big things to live for anymore, including not having religion. I think young people are looking around feeling as if their world is being tossed upside down. They are trapped in this existential state of worry about things like climate change and AI. And just as Jonathan Haidt writes in *[The Anxious Generation](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780593655030)*, social media can influence kids’ minds, particularly those who are the most anxious and vulnerable, making these emotions stronger.

I think after a while, they begin to feel like, “What’s the point?” And I think that if you operate in a very secular society and you feel you really don’t have much more to live for, nihilism becomes a more attractive ideology.

**FB**:What can we do as a society to fight against these ideologies?

**PM**: First, we need to understand and publicize the threat these online groups pose, as terrible and hard as it is to hear. That way, parents aren’t as casual about their kids having access to the internet. I’m just really worried about where we’re going with social media and how it’s manipulating our young people. And I think these extreme cases show what happens when these manipulative tools end up in the wrong hands.
