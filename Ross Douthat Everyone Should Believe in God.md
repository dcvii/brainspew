If there is not yet a true religious revival in the Western world, there is clearly a desire for one. The recent wave of secularization has [reached its limit](https://www.graphsaboutreligion.com/p/the-nones-have-hit-a-ceiling) in the last few years, and in particularly dechristianized countries like [the United Kingdom](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion/bulletins/religionenglandandwales/census2021#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%20in%20a%20census,most%20common%20response%20to%20the%20religion%20question.), the rising generation [appears more religious](https://x.com/ryanburge/status/1883912932607815837) than its predecessors. Among the intelligentsia there have been high-profile conversions, as Peter Savodnik [has written in these pages](https://www.thefp.com/p/how-intellectuals-found-god-ayaan-hirsi-ali-peter-thiel-jordan-peterson), and a larger sense of regret or anxiety over the decline of institutional faith. And there is a newfound fascination with supernaturalism, from the traditional to the New Age, Christian mysticism to telepathy.

But with the impulse toward religion there is also a new anxiety: What if people become religious for the wrong reasons?

When Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a longtime critic of religious fundamentalism, announced that she had [become a Christian](https://unherd.com/2023/11/why-i-am-now-a-christian/) in late 2023, there was grumbling from both atheists and some believers that hers was a political conversion—because she expressed a desire to defend what [she called](https://www.thefp.com/p/ayaan-hirsi-ali-why-i-am-now-christian-atheism) a “civilization built on the Judeo-Christian tradition.” (*The* *Washington Post*’s Shadi Hamid wrote, [for instance](https://x.com/shadihamid/status/1724897252685259237), that “fighting a civilizational war is never a good reason to convert to a religion.”)

In 2024, a *[Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/catholic-right-celebrity-conversion-industrial-complex?srsltid=AfmBOoqVqTop17iirMczHEuik9W1fZrDRzokHd2Z3JMwEELTqQVBEJPN)* [essay](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/catholic-right-celebrity-conversion-industrial-complex?srsltid=AfmBOoqVqTop17iirMczHEuik9W1fZrDRzokHd2Z3JMwEELTqQVBEJPN) by Kathryn Joyce warned darkly that a “celebrity-conversion industrial complex” is allegedly bringing figures like J.D. Vance and Candace Owens and Russell Brand into Roman Catholicism for politicized and influence-seeking reasons. And more recently, Tara Isabella Burton, one of our shrewdest writers on religion, offered a critique of what she called “memetic Christianity”—people embracing Christianity “as a necessary noble lie for a more orderly, or just, or optimistic society” in the godless West. The title of her article doubled as an admonition against utilitarian religion: “[Believe for Your Own Sake, Not for ‘The West](https://wisdomofcrowds.live/p/believe-for-your-own-sake-not-for).’ ”

As the author of a new book urging religious belief on, well, everybody, some of these critiques get my hackles up. In writing *[Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780310367581)*, which came out this past week, one of my assumptions was that there are a great many people in our culture who hover on the threshold of religion, and they need both reassurance that faith can be reasonable and a friendly but sharp-elbowed shove. But the idea that there exists some kind of ideal version of this process, some perfectly high-minded religious conversion unmediated by secondary influences, political inclinations, tribal loyalties—well, maybe among the greatest saints, but ordinary mortals are always likely to convert for some of the wrong reasons as well as some of the ideal ones.

(via Zondervan)

My own Catholic Church welcomed entire peoples [once upon a time](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11234a.htm) through the [conversion of their monarchs](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stephen-I-king-of-Hungary); we’re not going to turn someone away because they seem too attached to the Republican Party in 2025. Any potential Jewish religious revival will inevitably have a “tribal” or “cultural” aspect, because the Jews have always been a tribe and a people as well as a religious group. If a new convert seems in danger of politicizing the faith or associating it with crankish causes or conspiracy theories, they should be criticized or corrected, but with the knowledge that the exact same temptation afflicts people born and raised into religious loyalties as well.

*Ask and ye shall receive*, a well-known religious authority once suggested. *Knock and the door shall be opened unto you*. This offer has to hold even if the person knocking is liable to behave a little bit embarrassingly once inside.

But the part about asking and entering is crucial. The anxiety about bad converts is misplaced where it’s applied to actual conversions: people professing—with whatever doubts or difficulties—that they are now practicing and believing members of a faith.

There is, however, a different kind of relationship to religion that does deserve critique. This is the category of person who likes religious ideas when *other* people believe in them, who wants religion to exist for its civilization-shaping qualities without personally accepting any of its impositions, who draws pleasure from what the late Richard John Neuhaus called “regretful unbelief,” who only really believes in *belief*.

This is a special temptation for the intellectual. Think of the sociologist who has a thousand data points proving the advantages of joining and belonging and practicing a faith tradition, and an indifferent attitude to the tradition’s truth. The psychologist who stands ready with a thousand fascinating mythic readings of the Old or New Testament but dances away whenever he’s challenged about whether the events in question actually took place. The self-proclaimed “cultural Christian,” [whether of the Elon Musk](https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/articles/2024/elon-musk-says-hes-a-cultural-christian--why-some-leading-thinkers-are-embracing-christianity/) or the [Richard Dawkins school](https://x.com/LBC/status/1774510715975368778), who loves some aspect of the Western inheritance and fears some dark post-Western future—but not enough to actually embrace the West’s metaphysical foundations. The political philosopher with many religious friends and allies in front of whom he would never explicitly use [the term “noble lie](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-companion-to-platos-republic/noble-lie/F04B78C5546C7FB5E331248F35068F76),” even though you know he’s thinking it.

This tendency is especially suited to eras like our own, when the pendulum has swung away from militant atheism and toward some recognition that religion might be useful for society after all, though it takes somewhat different forms on the right and on the left.

The right-wing believer-in-belief will often defend the most traditionalist and fundamentalist forms of faith—though he would never be caught dead sharing their literalist or supernaturalist premises—because he likes how those forms shape culture and politics. Donald Trump, with his recent boisterous announcement that “[we have to bring religion back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8gf6cw9MCo),” offers a notable example of this kind of enthusiasm for other people’s churchgoing, though perhaps the president will surprise by actually attending church.

The liberal believer-in-belief is more likely to be a great lamenter, bemoaning the disappearance of the noble moderate religious intellectuals of yore*—Where have you gone, [Reinhold Niebuhr](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Reinhold-Niebuhr)?—*even though he himself could be that intellectual, if he would only show up at the nearest [mainline Protestant](https://religioninpublic.blog/2018/06/28/what-is-a-mainline-protestant/) congregation.

Where belief-in-belief differs fundamentally from the uncertain conversion is in its sense of comfort, its recoil from anything too destabilizing, its decision not to wager anything too meaningful on the biggest questions in the world. The mediocre convert with mixed motivations may not be where he is meant to be, but at least some risk is being taken, something is being offered up or staked, and some important threshold is being crossed—whereas belief-in-belief is fundamentally too soft and settled a disposition to actually stand up to atheism when the cultural pendulum swings back.

As happened, for instance, with the mid-twentieth- century “Judeo-Christian” moment, a high tide of belief-in-belief, when then president-elect Dwight Eisenhower [made his famous remark](https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/eisenhowers/quotes) that the American experiment “has no sense unless it is founded in a deeply felt religious faith, and I don't care what it is.” Those years were the last time the American establishment was clearly favorable to traditional religion, but it was a favorability that often rested more on religion’s social or political utility than its truth, and it collapsed quickly when the social revolutions of the 1960s arrived.

But I come not just to criticize this tendency, to poke gently at any figure you might recognize in the sketches just above. Some of the critique has to be aimed at the religious as well, for not pushing hard enough against this spirit, not arguing more directly with friends and allies who occupy this space.

We (the religious) like being liked, we appreciate being appreciated, and belief-in-belief provides a useful language to translate between the strangeness of some of our convictions and the world of secular priorities and routines. To talk about faith’s benefits rather than its truth claims. To promise [therapeutic advantages](https://www.arizonachristian.edu/2021/04/27/counterfeit-christianity-moralistic-therapeutic-deism-most-popular-worldview-in-u-s-culture/) when talk of heaven seems embarrassing. To remain in the natural and material and psychological because that way you don’t lose anyone by mentioning the Devil.

All while telling ourselves, of course, that belief-in-belief is one of the paths to real conversion. As, indeed, it quite often is—but only if you don’t make the position feel too comfortable, too much like a well-appointed destination, rather than a station on the way.

Having spent 15 years as [a religious columnist](https://www.nytimes.com/column/ross-douthat) for an audience that includes a great many nonbelievers, I am as guilty of this kind of incomplete evangelization as any other writer. But my new book is a deliberate attempt to leave this kind of halfway argument behind, and to persuade readers to accept religious ideas on their own terms—to transcend the merely sociological and talk directly about why there’s probably a real God with actual demands and expectations, a real supernatural realm that plays some role in human life and history, and yes, a real heaven and a risk of hell.

One of the liberating things about the stranger world we find ourselves in today, the weirder timeline of plagues and populism, psychedelic encounters and AI voices in the air, is that it feels more reasonable to be straightforward in religious argument—to say that of course belief is good for all manner of secondary reasons, but the primary reason is that the core claims of religion are not a fiction, noble or otherwise, but quite probably just the truth. And in that spirit to bless—with whatever warnings and admonitions—the unruly neophyte, the sinful half-believer, and the slightly embarrassing convert.
