The United States and China are the two [largest economies](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/largest-economies-in-the-world.php) globally in both nominal and PPP methods. The US is at the top in nominal, whereas China has been at the top in PPP since 2014 after overtaking the US. As of [2025](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/gdp-indicators-2025.php), both countries together share 43.71% and 34.43% of the entire [world's GDP](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/world-gdp.php) in nominal and PPP terms, respectively. The GDP of both countries is higher than the 3rd-ranked countries, Japan (nominal) and India (PPP), by a huge margin. Therefore, only these two compete to become first.

As per projections by the IMF for 2025, with $30,507 billion, the [United States](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/country/us-gdp.php) is leading by $11,276 billion, or 1.59 times that of China ($19,232 billion) on an exchange rate basis. The economy of China (Int. $40,716 billion) is Int. $10,209 billion, or 1.33x that of the US (Int. $30,507 billion), on a purchasing power parity basis. According to estimates by the World Bank, [China's GDP](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/country/china-gdp.php) was approx. 11% of the US's GDP in 1960, but in 2024 it is 64%.

Due to the vast population of China, more than four times the US's population, the difference between these two countries is very high in terms of per capita income. The [per capita income](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp-capita.php) of the [United States](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/country/us-gdp-per-capita.php) is 6.51 and 3.07 times higher than that of [China](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/country/china-gdp-per-capita.php) in nominal and PPP terms, respectively. The US is the 7th richest country in the world, whereas China comes in at 73rd rank. On a PPP basis, the United States is in 10th position, and China is at 77th.

[China](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/country/china-gdp-growth.php) achieved a maximum GDP growth rate of 19.30% in 1970 and a minimum of -27.27% in 1961. During the period 1961 to 2022, China grew by more than 10% in 22 years. The [United States](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/country/us-gdp-growth.php) reached an all-time high of 7.24% in 1984 and a record low of -2.58% in 2009. The GDP growth rate was negative in seven years for the US. China showed negative growth in five years.
