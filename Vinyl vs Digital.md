Q. Is it true that CDs don't sound as good as vinyl?

A. No.

And this is the reason: a disc cutting lathe (this one is a Neumann VMS80 at Abbey Road Studios).

All vinyl recordings start here. Whether the source is analogue tape or (far more likely these days) a digital recording, the material is literally cut onto an acetate master disc from which all subsequent pressings are derived.

The cutting process is pretty violent, at a microscopic level. You are chipping away at a chunk of plastic with a diamond. A note at say 15kHz requires 15,000 “chips” in one second of playing time. That is about 5/8″ of one disc groove at the outer edge of a 12″ disc at 33 rpm. As the stylus moves towards the centre things get much tighter. Sometimes, the track ordering on an album is changed to keep certain material away from the centre.

But it’s the note at say 40 Hz (a low bass note) that you want to worry about, because those chips are bigger and deeper to produce the amplitude (volume) required. And cutting those notes can cause the cutter to bounce out of the groove and ruin the mastering process.

So the Recording Industry Association of America came up with an industry standard. We master the acetates by cutting out most of the bass content, but by an agreed amount. Frequencies at 20Hz are cut 20 decibels quieter than the original master tape (or digital recording); frequencies at 20,000 Hz are 20 db louder. The crossover point (where equalisation has no effect at all) is at 1,000 Hz.

Every sound that is not 1,000 Hz has now been distorted. The blue line on this graph shows what happens to the recorded sound.

The phono pre-amp stage of your domestic playback system contains automatic, pre-set “tone controls”, which boost the bass by 20 db and cut the treble by 20 db. That is the red line. So you are now hearing a very rough approximation of what was recorded in the studio, before the material got anywhere near the dreaded cutting lathe.

Audiophiles worrying about the frequency response of their equipment being dead flat may now stop worrying. The sound has been butchered for you in advance.

If you want to hear what vinyl really sounds like, cobble together a playback system without an RIAA phono pre-amp stage. And wince.

The extraordinary thing is that this sort of works, and a lot of people prefer the (frankly distorted) sound of vinyl. And that is a choice they are free to make.

But none of the above processes are required to digitally master a CD. That is the closest possible representation to what the producers and sound engineers and musicians were hearing when the recorded and mixed the track. Within the bounds of human hearing, it is “perfect”. And perfect is the holy grail of audiophiles who spend six-figure sums on hi-fi equipment because it has “fidelity” to the original recording, to a high degree.

If you want hi-fi, don’t listen to vinyl. The physics does not lie.
