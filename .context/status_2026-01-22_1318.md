# Status Report - Python CI/CD Spec Generation

**Date**: 2026-01-22 13:18 PST  
**Task**: Generate Python specification from intent.md

## Completed
- ✅ Read and analyzed intent.md requirements
- ✅ Investigated project structure (git repository with markdown files)
- ✅ Created comprehensive spec.md with:
  - Python 3.11 based solution
  - GitHub Actions workflow design
  - Twice-weekly scheduling (Tuesday/Friday)
  - Manual trigger capability
  - Security considerations using GitHub tokens
  - Error handling and bulletproof design

## Key Specifications
- **Architecture**: Python script + GitHub Actions
- **Frequency**: Twice weekly automated runs
- **Trigger**: Manual button via workflow_dispatch
- **Security**: GitHub token authentication
- **File Structure**: Clear organization with .github/workflows/

## Next Steps
The spec is ready for implementation. Next phase would involve:
1. Creating the Python update script
2. Setting up GitHub Actions workflow
3. Configuring environment files
4. Testing the automation

## Files Created
- `.context/spec.md` - Complete technical specification
