I want you to build a design in the context of a very simple script that will use formal CI/CD with Github Actions. It will use Python. I want one button I can use to kickoff a job that will update the remote branch. Us the 'Github Flow' pattern. Always use the main branch. It should run every few days, maybe twice a week. Keep this simple and bulletproof. Write the plan into the .context folder as 'spec.md'
