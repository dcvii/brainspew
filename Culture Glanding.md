In _The Culture_ series, “glanding” refers to the voluntary activation of specialized glands that allow individuals to produce and regulate various psychoactive and physiological substances. Given the Culture’s playfulness with language and its inclination toward vivid, evocative terminology, alternative verbs could include:

• **Juicing** – Emphasizes the biochemical aspect of secretion.

• **Triggering** – Suggests a deliberate, controlled initiation.

• **Tuning** – Implies fine control over the process.

• **Dosing** – Highlights the self-administration aspect.

• **Ramping** – Conveys a gradual increase in effect.

• **Surging** – Implies a rapid, powerful activation.

• **Flooding** – Evokes a full-body immersion in the effect.

• **Pulsing** – Suggests a rhythmic or controlled release.

• **Spiking** – Indicates a sharp, sudden effect.

• **Warming** – Could be used for euphoric or relaxing substances.

• **Igniting** – Suitable for stimulating or energizing compounds.

• **Phasing** – Suggests a subtle or controlled modulation.

• **Tickling** – Could work for light, pleasurable effects.

• **Seeding** – A poetic way to describe the initial activation of a slow-building glandular response.

• **Ghosting** – If the effect is subtle, barely perceptible.

• **Riffing** – Connotes a playful, improvisational engagement with one’s biochemistry.

  

Culture citizens, with their tendency toward irreverent and idiosyncratic expression, would likely use multiple terms interchangeably, often shifting depending on context and personal style.
