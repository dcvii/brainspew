**John Chris Kiriakou** ([/ k i r i ˈ ɑː k uː /](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [*kee-ree- AH -koo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key");[^5] born August 9, 1964) is an American [whistleblower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblowing "Whistleblowing"), author, journalist and former intelligence officer.[^6] Kiriakou is a [columnist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnist "Columnist") with Reader Supported News [^7] and co-host of *Political Misfits* on [Sputnik Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_\(news_agency\) "Sputnik (news agency)").[^8] He was sent to prison for exposing the torturous interrogation techniques of the [Central Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency") (CIA).

He was an [intelligence analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_analysis "Intelligence analysis") and [operations officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Operations_\(CIA\) "Directorate of Operations (CIA)") for the CIA's [Counterterrorism Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism_Mission_Center "Counterterrorism Mission Center"), senior investigator for the [Senate Foreign Relations Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Foreign_Relations_Committee "Senate Foreign Relations Committee"), and a consultant for [ABC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News_\(United_States\) "ABC News (United States)").[^9] [^10] [^11] He was the first U.S. government official to confirm in December 2007 that [waterboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding "Waterboarding") was used to interrogate al-Qaeda prisoners, which he described as [torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture "Torture").[^12] [^13]

In 2012, Kiriakou became the only CIA officer to be convicted for exposing the CIA's [enhanced interrogation program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_interrogation_techniques "Enhanced interrogation techniques"), having passed classified information to a reporter.[^14] He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in prison.[^15]

Kiriakou was born on August 9, 1964, the son of elementary school educators in [Sharon, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon,_Pennsylvania "Sharon, Pennsylvania"), and raised in nearby [New Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Castle,_Pennsylvania "New Castle, Pennsylvania"), Pennsylvania. His grandparents had immigrated from [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece").[^16] Kiriakou graduated from [New Castle High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Castle_Junior/Senior_High_School "New Castle Junior/Senior High School") in 1982 and attended [George Washington University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University "George Washington University") in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), where he earned a bachelor's degree in [Middle Eastern studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern_studies "Middle Eastern studies") and a master's degree in legislative affairs.

## CIA career

Kiriakou was recruited into the CIA by a graduate school professor who had been a senior CIA official.[^17] Kiriakou spent the first eight years of his career as a [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") analyst specializing on [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq").[^17] He maintained a [Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Secret/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information "Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information") security clearance.[^17] He learned Arabic and, from 1994 to 1996, was assigned to the American Embassy in [Manama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manama "Manama"), Bahrain, as an economic officer.[^17] He returned to Washington, D.C. to work on Iraq until 1998, when he transferred to the CIA's [Directorate of Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Operations_\(CIA\) "Directorate of Operations (CIA)").[^17] He became a counter-terrorism [operations officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_officer "Operations officer") and worked in [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens"), Greece, where the CIA targeted [17N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Organization_17_November "Revolutionary Organization 17 November") and other leftist Greek terrorist groups, as well as secular Palestinian revolutionaries. In Greece, Kiriakou recruited foreign agents to spy for the United States, and was nearly assassinated by leftists.[^18] In 2000, Kiriakou returned to [CIA headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_headquarters "CIA headquarters").[^17]

Following the [September 11 terrorist attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_terrorist_attacks "September 11 terrorist attacks"), Kiriakou was named Chief of Counterterrorist Operations in [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan"). In that position, he led a series of [military raids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_\(military\) "Raid (military)") on [al-Qaeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda") [safehouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safehouse "Safehouse"), capturing dozens of al-Qaeda fighters. Kiriakou led a raid on the night of March 28, 2002, in [Faisalabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisalabad "Faisalabad"), Pakistan, capturing [Abu Zubaydah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Zubaydah "Abu Zubaydah"), then thought to be al-Qaeda's third-ranking official.[^17] He left the CIA in 2004 to take up a consulting job.[^14]

From 2004 until 2008, Kiriakou worked as a senior manager in the [Big Four accounting firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firm "Big Four accounting firm"), [Deloitte & Touche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte_%26_Touche "Deloitte & Touche") 's, [competitive intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_intelligence "Competitive intelligence") practice.[^19] From September 2008 until March 2009, Kiriakou was a terrorism consultant for [ABC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News_\(United_States\) "ABC News (United States)"). Following Senator [John Kerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry "John Kerry") 's (D-MA) ascension to the chairmanship of the [Senate Foreign Relations Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Foreign_Relations_Committee "Senate Foreign Relations Committee") in 2009, Kiriakou became the committee's senior [United States Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") investigator, focusing on the Middle East, [international terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_terrorism "International terrorism"), [piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy "Piracy"), and [counter-narcotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-narcotics "Counter-narcotics") issues.[^20] In 2011, he left the committee to become [managing partner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_partner "Managing partner") of Rhodes Global Consulting, an [Arlington, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Virginia "Arlington, Virginia") -based political [risk analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_analysis_\(business\) "Risk analysis (business)") firm.[^21] From April 2011 to April 2012, he resumed [counter-terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism "Counter-terrorism") consulting for ABC News.[^21] He speaks often at colleges and universities around the country about the CIA, terrorism, torture, and ethics in intelligence operations.

## Disclosing torture

On December 10, 2007, Kiriakou gave an interview to [ABC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News_\(United_States\) "ABC News (United States)") [^22] in which he described his participation in the capture of Abu Zubaydah, who was accused of having been an aide to al-Qaeda leader [Osama bin Laden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden "Osama bin Laden"). Kiriakou said that he did not witness Zubaydah's [interrogation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogation "Interrogation"), but had been told by CIA associates that it had taken only a single brief instance of waterboarding to extract answers:

> ... He was able to withstand the waterboarding for quite some time. And by that I mean probably 30, 35 seconds... and a short time afterwards, in the next day or so, he told his interrogator that Allah had visited him in his cell during the night and told him to cooperate.[^23]

Following the interview, Kiriakou's accounts of Abu Zubaydah's waterboarding were widely repeated and paraphrased,[^3] [^12] and he became a regular guest expert on news and [public affairs shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_affairs_\(broadcasting\) "Public affairs (broadcasting)") on the topics of interrogation and counter-terrorism.

In 2009, however, it was reported that Abu Zubaydah had been waterboarded at least 83 times.[^24] The treatment "broke" Abu Zubaydah and he told his interrogators of al-Qaeda terrorism plots. However, the torture and waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah generated little or no useful additional information to what was already known.[^25] [^26]

Kiriakou has said that he chose not to blow the whistle on torture through internal channels because he believed he "wouldn't have gotten anywhere" because his superiors and the congressional intelligence committees were already aware of it.[^27]

After the ABC News interview, Kiriakou exchanged emails with a freelance writer. In the emails, Kiriakou disclosed the name of a former CIA colleague who had participated in the detention and interrogation program; the employee was, at the time, still undercover.[^28] The freelance writer then shared the name with [lawyers representing detainees held at Guantanamo Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_attorneys "Guantanamo Bay attorneys").[^28] The name then appeared in a sealed legal filing submitted by the defense attorneys.[^28] Although the name was not made public at the time, the disclosure angered federal officials, and the resulting federal investigation led to Kiriakou's arrest.[^28] The name that was disclosed appeared on the New York Times website in October 2011.[^28]

On January 23, 2012, Kiriakou was charged with disclosing classified information to journalists, including the name of a covert CIA officer and information revealing the role of another CIA employee, [Deuce Martinez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuce_Martinez "Deuce Martinez"), in classified activities.[^29] [^30] [^31] In addition, Kiriakou was alleged to have lied to the CIA in order to have his book published.[^32] His criminal defense lawyer was Robert Trout.[^33] His other lawyer, [Jesselyn Radack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesselyn_Radack "Jesselyn Radack"),[^34] told [Politico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico "Politico") that the government was wrong to deny Kiriakou's whistleblower status.[^35]

According to [PEN America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEN_America "PEN America"):

> The specific charges were that in 2008, Kiriakou confirmed the name of a CIA officer—which was already well known to people in the human rights community, according to the Government Accountability Project—to someone who claimed to be writing a book about the agency's rendition practices. In a separate 2008 incident, Kiriakou gave a *New York Times* journalist the business card of a CIA agent who worked for a "private government contractor known for its involvement in torture." That agent had never been undercover and his contact information and affiliation with the CIA was already publicly available on the Internet. Kiriakou faced up to 45 years in prison and millions of dollars in legal fees for these charges.[^27]

On April 5, 2012, Kiriakou was [indicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment "Indictment") for one count of violating the [Intelligence Identities Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Identities_Protection_Act "Intelligence Identities Protection Act"), three counts of violating the [Espionage Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917 "Espionage Act of 1917"), and one count of [making false statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements "Making false statements") for allegedly lying to the Publications Review Board of the CIA.[^36] Kiriakou initially pleaded [not guilty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_guilty_\(plea\) "Not guilty (plea)") to all charges and was released on bail.[^37]

Starting September 12, 2012, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia conducted closed [Classified Information Procedures Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_Information_Procedures_Act "Classified Information Procedures Act") hearings in Kiriakou's case.[^38]

On October 22, 2012, Kiriakou agreed to plead guilty to one count of passing classified information to the media thereby violating the [Intelligence Identities Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Identities_Protection_Act "Intelligence Identities Protection Act"); his plea deal spared journalists from testifying in a trial. All other charges were dropped.[^39]

On January 25, 2013, Kiriakou was sentenced to 30 months in prison, making him the second CIA employee to be jailed for revealing classified material of CIA undercover identities [^27] [^28] in violation of the [Intelligence Identities Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Identities_Protection_Act "Intelligence Identities Protection Act") (the first was [Sharon Scranage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Scranage_espionage_scandal "Sharon Scranage espionage scandal"), a CIA secretary who was arrested and convicted in 1985).[^40] In February 2013 *[New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* reporter [Scott Shane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Shane "Scott Shane") referenced the Kiriakou case when he told NPR that Obama's prosecutions of journalism-related leaking were having a [chilling effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect_\(law\) "Chilling effect (law)") on coverage of national security issues.[^41]

In January 2013, [Bruce Riedel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Riedel "Bruce Riedel"), a former CIA analyst and intelligence adviser to [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama"), sent the President a letter signed by eighteen other CIA veterans urging that Kiriakou's sentence be [commuted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutation_of_sentence "Commutation of sentence").[^28]

John Kiriakou talking on prison survival and whistleblowing at the Disruption Network Lab, Berlin, 2017

Kiriakou received a prison "send off" party at an exclusive Washington, D.C., hotel hosted by political peace activists dressed in orange jumpsuits and mock prison costumes.[^42]

On February 28, 2013, Kiriakou began serving his term at the low-security [Federal Correctional Institution, Loretto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Correctional_Institution,_Loretto "Federal Correctional Institution, Loretto"), in [Loretto, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretto,_Pennsylvania "Loretto, Pennsylvania").[^15]

In summer 2013, Kiriakou wrote an open "Letter From Loretto" to [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden "Edward Snowden"), published by the blog [Firedoglake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firedoglake "Firedoglake"), expressing his support and giving advice; urging him to not, "under any circumstances, cooperate with the [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI "FBI") ".[^43]

On February 3, 2015, Kiriakou was released from prison to serve three months of house arrest at his home in [Arlington, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Virginia "Arlington, Virginia").[^44] Following his release, Kiriakou said his case was not about leaking information but about exposing torture, continuing, "and I would do it all over again." He has since expressed interest in campaigning for [prison reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_reform "Prison reform").[^44]

In July 2018, Kiriakou signed a $50,000 agreement with Karen Giorno, a former campaign advisor to Donald Trump, as payment for lobbying for a [pardon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States "Federal pardons in the United States"), with the promise of an additional $50,000 as a bonus if it was granted. Kiriakou said that he also discussed his quest for a pardon with [Rudy Giuliani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani"), in 2020. Specifically, an associate of the latter's suggested that they could help, but "it's going to cost $2 million — he's \[Giuliani\] going to want two million bucks"; Kiriakou laughed, and said that "even if \[he\] had two million bucks, \[he\] wouldn't spend it to recover a $700,000 pension." [^45]

In a 2018 op-ed for the *Washington Post*, Kiriakou criticized [Gina Haspel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Haspel "Gina Haspel"), a CIA officer nominated by Trump to the post of CIA director, writing that "while I went to prison for disclosing the torture program, Haspel is about to get a promotion despite her connection to it." [^46] Kiriakou said the time he spent in prison was "worth every day" because revelations about the CIA's use of torture led to Congress's enactment of a specific ban on waterboarding and other techniques used at the black sites.[^46]

Kiriakou is a founding member of the organization [Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran_Intelligence_Professionals_for_Sanity "Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity") (VIPS).[^47] In September 2015, Kiriakou and 27 other members of VIPS' steering committee wrote a letter to President Barack Obama challenging a recently published book that claimed to rebut the report of the [Senate Intelligence Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Intelligence_Committee "United States Senate Intelligence Committee") on the [Central Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency") 's use of torture.

## Views

In January 2022, Kiriakou commented to [Declassified UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declassified_UK "Declassified UK") about their allegations that the [National Endowment for Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_Democracy "National Endowment for Democracy") (NED), a non-profit corporation funded by the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress"), had funnelled millions of dollars into British independent media groups since 2016. He said: "In 2011, the US Congress [changed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Modernization_Act_of_2012 "Smith–Mundt Modernization Act of 2012") the [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act "Smith–Mundt Act") that forbade the Executive Branch from propagandizing the American people or nationals of the other ' [Five Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes "Five Eyes") ' countries—the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[^4] The National Endowment for Democracy, like [Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty"), countless Washington-area 'think tanks', and [Radio/TV Martí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_y_Televisi%C3%B3n_Mart%C3%AD "Radio y Televisión Martí") \[the US broadcaster that transmits to Cuba\], are the vehicles for that propaganda.... And what better way to spread that propaganda than to funnel money to 'friendly' outlets in 'friendly countries'? The CIA's propaganda efforts throughout history have been shameless. But now that they're not legally relegated to just Russia and China, the whole world is a target." [^48]
