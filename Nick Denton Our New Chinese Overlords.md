Hi there. Welcome to another DishCast in the great new era of Trump 2.0. If you have not subscribed, please subscribe. Otherwise, this riveting conversation that is about to take place will disappear within not that long and you won't hear the rest of it. All of you have subscribed. I just want to thank you again for supporting us.

0:53

Over 20,000 paid subscribers, 200,000 or so. Almost 200,000 subscribers in total, which is fantastic. But more importantly, for me at least, it's the right 20,000 and the right 200,000. I can't tell you how... Gratifying and wonderful it is when you see the intro and you just see that there are so many still very engaged,

1:21

smart people able to engage ideas, to disagree with you civilly, to enjoy ideas. having a difference of opinion as opposed to be scared of it and dish heads give me hope and i'm not doing this just to flatter you know i don't do that generally

1:41

speaking but i am i am doing it to say i'm grateful because you have created a space where people like me can actually exist and do what we want without fear or favor and that's incredibly important no advertising on this thing No one else is paying my money. No foundation is helping me anywhere.

2:01

What you see is what you get. And that's always been the case with the dish, and it will always be the case. Coming up, we have Francis Collins coming on to talk about faith and science. Francis, who was the head of NIH, and has just quit.

2:16

And we'll have a lot of interesting things to talk to him about. Not just, obviously. religion and evangelicalism and science, but also some of the more controversial parts of recent NIH endeavors. Anyway, today we have a very special guest, someone I've known for a very long time, an old friend. His name is Nick Denton.

2:39

He's an entrepreneur and a journalist. You've probably heard of him. He was the founder, this is what you probably heard most about him, of Gorka Media, the publisher of Gizmodo, the editor of Valleywag, a real pioneer of new media when we were all doing it. He began his career as a journalist with the Financial Times,

2:57

as a derivatives and tech correspondent, and later founded a Silicon Valley news aggregator called Moreover Technologies. He's now working on maize.com, which hosts a network map of near future timelines. And the one thing you know about Nick is that he's incredibly attuned to the latest developments in technology and science,

3:19

In where the world is headed, you might call him a futurist in some respects. And so we'll get into some of those questions later. I'm going to ask you about people like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, people he has come to know in the past. Well, Peter Thiel not quite come to know.

3:34

Has a quite interesting relationship with Peter Thiel. I came to know him. Yes. We'll talk about all the other gay versus gay struggles in the media world. But from Budapest, of all places, thank you so much for joining us. i'm very happy to be here nick where were you born and what did your parents do

3:57

hamstered london bougie liberal liberal no not really okay i my mother was hungarian hungarian jewish left hungary in 1956 and For obvious reasons. During the revolution against Soviet rule, Soviet occupation. My father grew up poor in Yorkshire, lower, lower middle class, and was smart enough to be a scholarship boy, go to Oxford, study PPE, politics, philosophy,

4:29

and economics, as I later did.

4:30

Where did you go to school before Oxford? Just interesting. I think it was... One of those grammar schools?

4:37

No, no, no. He went to a school in Loughborough where he'd been, they declared a day's holiday when he got into Oxford because he was the first, I think he was the first kids to go to any university from that school. It was one of those, I guess, secondary modern kind of schools.

4:58

How did he end up in Hampstead? How did that move happen?

5:02

He married my mother, and my mother was ambitious. She had arrived as a refugee, penniless in 56. Her own mother, who spoke no English, came the year after, managed to buy her way to a passport. And they worked. They worked. They worked and worked and worked and worked. And I think she'd always wanted to live in Hampstead.

5:25

I was recently going through some old videos for some other reasons, but there's this line where she says that she always wanted to live in Buda, which is the hilly part of Budapest. And that had been her father's dream, her father who had died in the camps. And she felt that by living in Hampstead,

5:44

it took her 21 years from arriving in England to living in Hampstead, but she felt like she had arrived in Buda.

5:53

The Hampstead Heath, the vantage point where you go up the hill and you can see a lot of London. That's what she was sort of analogizing.

6:01

And where she just, for the next school year, we've just leased the house in the Buddha Hills. So I feel like everything has come full circle.

6:11

And what was little Nick like? Tell me, as a kid, what interested you as a boy? I was a nerdy boy. A nerdy boy. Really?

6:22

No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, of course you were. Of course I was. Aren't they all? I was a huge science fiction fan from about the age of 13. I read The Economist from about the same age. My dad left it around, and I would try to steal it from him before he could get to it.

6:41

And I guess that was pretty much my education, The Economist. which I read cover to cover kind of avidly in a way that I don't do now. And conversations with my father, which were pretty much like a, it was a little bit like an Oxford seminar tutorial.

7:00

And I had a trouble relationship. What were the topics that you talked to him about? What were the areas of discussion? Everything?

7:07

Politics, economics, business, how to manage. He was an academic, but got a job at the Foreign Office trying to turn around some foreign office conference center which was kind of the way i started my journalistic career it was someone i met at he he took me down to the conference

7:25

and i met a romanian politician that later proved my way into journalism my way into the financial times where did you go to school school called university college school in hampstead which was a Secular school, but about 50% Jewish. And pretty much all my parents' friends were Hungarian Jewish.

7:46

My father, though English, I don't think he ever really felt that English. He felt European. He was a kind of fanatical European federalist. Really? Interesting. Go on. He ran a think tank for a long time called the Federal Trust, which was all about, you know, Britain needing to leave its empire behind, get out of Ireland,

8:11

and seek its future as a medium-sized country, among medium-sized countries in Europe. And I've kind of come round to that belief. After a flirtation with America for a long time, I now see that he was right, I was wrong.

8:31

We'll get to that. We will get to that. It's interesting. What did you think you wanted to do with your life when you were a teenager? I was definitely into politics.

8:42

I had volunteered for, do you remember the SDP, the Social Democratic Party? So that was my, I was into them. I was not into the liberals. I wasn't into the kind of soft centrism. But I was, I guess David Owen would probably have been

9:02

my politician of that time and david at the time was what had been foreign secretary for callahan right of the labor primates and a very dashing figure in

9:12

many ways i mean he was kind of a right-wing social democrat yeah yeah which is i

9:18

think i think where i've ended up yeah a kind of what you call here a scoop jackson democrat in in some ways a sort of more uh interventionist macrat So, and did you want to go to college? Did you want to go to university? Was that your ambition too?

9:34

Yeah, it was never really a question.

9:37

So where'd you go?

9:38

I went to Oxford like my father had. I studied politics, philosophy, and economics like my father had. I was only really interested in one thing. Maybe two things. So I was interested in political transitions, in the system change that was beginning to take place in the Eastern Bloc. We'd been traveling to Hungary since I was a kid.

10:01

What years were these at Oxford? That would have been 85 to 88. And then both before university and after university, I was in Hungary. So before I took my year off in Hungary. And then after university, that's where I went to start a career in journalism. What did you make of Oxford?

10:25

But the other thing that I was actually super into... And here there's another kind of Hungarian-Jewish connection. For some reason, the college I went to, University College, some of the professors and tutors there were very much into game theory. And so a mathematical interpretation of...

10:45

History, politics, some kind of grand unified theory of it all was always very appealing to me. And I think it actually been very appealing to me since I was a kid. My favorite, as I said, I was a big science fiction fan. And my favorite science fiction was Isaac Asimov and the Foundation series.

11:04

I'm not alone in that. I recently discovered that Elon Musk had called his latest son, Selden. And Selden, as in Harry Selden, I presume it's Harry Selden. I haven't seen anything about that. Selden was the one who predicted the fall of the Galactic Empire.

11:22

So it had mathematically proven that the Galactic Empire was rotten to its core and would fall. And the interregnum would be a terrible time of wars and starvation. And it couldn't be avoided. But the only thing that could be done was it could be with a delicate intervention. It could be the period, the interregnum could be shortened.

11:48

So the transition from one empire to another could be made more rapid. And that was something that absolutely fascinated me. I mean, I was... I was into the idea of all these branching futures, the points at which the future does branch, at which there is the possibility to intervene and with a small change,

12:08

a small possible change with a long enough lever, you can move the world. And I think that's probably been a theme throughout my life, just the visual representation of of all these branching timelines, the points at which discussions and stories branch, you know, there are two possible paths. And that's really what I'm trying to do right now,

12:32

you know, in the scenario planning and the timeline mapping that I'm doing with colleagues here in Budapest. But we'll get to that too.

12:41

Yeah, the appeal of this, is it not, that you can actually predict or find predictable rules in a way, some kind of simulacrum of mathematical certainty with respect to human political affairs. I mean, that's the dream, right? That's the... Is that right or wrong? Am I misunderstanding? I think that was the fantasy.

13:08

And actually, in the Asimov books, they talk about these equations that are put up on the wall. And I guess that probably has closest parallels to macroeconomics. But macroeconomics, I think, is largely rubbish and not useful. And I had almost zero interest in it at university.

13:26

It just seems to be a whole bunch of talk to employ central bankers and those that analyze them. And so I don't find that part interesting.

13:35

Here's the question. What gave you the self-confidence? To dismiss a whole field like that? Yes, when you're in college. I mean, it takes... I mean, I'm not saying I wasn't like that as well, but I've sometimes asked myself, who the fuck did I think I was?

13:53

And just looking at these things saying, this doesn't make sense to me, I'm done. I just get bored.

13:58

I know. I get bored by so much stuff. Yeah. And I guess over time I learned to... pay attention to what i was interested in yeah and what i wasn't interested in and and after i had a little bit of positive reinforcement so where things that i was

14:15

interested in turned out to be important and predictions that felt right to me it's not like i come up with predictions you know the predictions are all out there either in science fiction or you know in in videos you see on TikTok, or I seem to attract a lot of that kind of content.

14:36

Just social media brings it to me. And so you, you know, it's all out there. You know, the Palmer Luckey, who's kind of brilliant. And, you know, one of the, I mean, he's an American original. Who, again, Palmer Luckey. Okay. Not approved of by liberal circles. The Anderil... You know, military technology entrepreneur,

15:02

part of the whole teal circle, I guess, although he's a standalone right now. He invented the Oculus, the visor, and he was kicked out of Facebook for supporting Trump. And he says the same. Basically, none of his ideas are new. Everything he's ever done, he read in science fiction. And really, the question is, how do you...

15:30

Amongst all those bullshit stories... Which one works? Often very badly written stories. The Foundation by Asimov is not a well-written book. It's not beautifully... It's clunky. But the ideas are strong. And if you have a feel for it, you can pick up ideas and you make them part of your theory.

15:50

And that was the idea that stuck with me pretty much all my life. So after Oxford, you become a journalist? Mm-hmm. How quickly? Very quickly. So I'm in Budapest immediately after university. And I guess this is... It would have been early 89. And Hungary at that time was one of the first countries to liberalize.

16:20

They cut a hole in the Iron Curtain as part of some stunt. I think they needed money from Germany and the Germans wanted to be reunited. And so East Germans who had come to vacation in Bolotan with family members from West Germany, it was the one place they could meet.

16:37

They came to Bolotan and then they would escape through this little hole in the Iron Curtain. And the little hole expanded and expanded. And soon they were going and camping out in embassies. And there were floods and floods. And, you know, a few months later, the Berlin Wall fell.

16:55

And so that was pretty much the beginning of my journalistic career.

16:59

That's an amazing place to be at the beginning of your career. You're in the round zero of the biggest... sort of regime change in that area in a half a century?

17:14

Sometimes I've thought of myself, I mean, not really as a Zelig character, but I have had a tendency to be in the right place at the right time, and sometimes in the wrong place at the wrong time.

17:28

How did that affect you, change you, that experience of being there as this extraordinary revolution took place around you? I mean,

17:37

Probably the real beginning was actually the revolution in Romania. So Hungary had been peaceful, and it was demonstrations and a big speech by Viktor Orban, the current Hungarian leader, when he was a student firebrand, in which he out and out called for the Russians to go home. Something which had not been said before.

18:03

Something he wouldn't say today. His attitude to all the Russians has shifted somewhat over the years. They were the Soviets.

18:12

We can talk about that. Actually, we should talk about the Russians, I think. Not the Soviets. This goes way back, much further back than 1917. But the revolution in Romania was very violent. So much, much harsher dictator, much more hated. You saw the moment when his power left him on the balcony, addressing an organized, assembled crowd.

18:40

And finally, people started muttering and then shouting. And then he realized that he had lost the crowd on live television.

18:50

Ceausescu we're talking about.

18:51

Ceausescu. The fear had gone. The reign of terror was over in an instant. And that was amazing just to see. That was kind of more amazing than the Hungarian experience, which was kind of gradual. And moving and where the whole country kind of came together to ask for the demand that the Russians leave.

19:13

But in Romania, you saw a system change happening in front of your eyes. And that had a big impact on me. Just seeing how even the apparently strongest of power can disappear in an instant as people realize that everybody else feels the way they do.

19:34

I think it's what this value people talk, they describe it as a preference cascade. I think that's the scientific term. It's a useful term and it can be applied right now to many other things. Who did you work for at that point? Who were you writing for? In Romania, first of all, for the Telegraph.

19:56

But then I met this, there was a guy called Silvio Bruquin, who was a Jewish eminence Greece, who had been, I think, one of the ones that had made the switch most effectively. People said that he had connections to Russia and to Gorbachev and that he organized the whole thing. It wasn't a revolution, but it was a

20:17

coup organized by the, I guess they would call them globalists now. And I spotted him because I'd met him at my father's conference center, the Foreign Office Conference Center. I spotted him at the back of a boring... press conference of the new government and i knew that he was interesting and uh

20:37

and he was doing nothing but watch the watch the show and so i went up and introduced myself to him or i guess i introduced myself to him because i hadn't actually met him at the previous time and said where i'd met him and and all that

20:50

and i realized that he wasn't that interested in talking to the daily telegraph but i had made friends with john lloyd from the financial times oh yeah and what a

20:58

great writer he was mm-hmm He is. He is. Sorry. I just remember him from my, when I would read.

21:05

Oh, I mean, he's, he's amazing. I mean, it was, it was a great financial science was a great, it was a great team at that time. It was John Lloyd, Christopher Freeland, you know, who later became finance minister of Canada and just lost the running for the leader of the liberal party in Canada.

21:21

She was my boss for a couple of years. And I knew that that, the ft would attract him because that was the wave that's that's who he wanted to talk to and he wanted to talk to all the intelligent people out there all the

21:34

powerful people out there and the ft was a good way of doing like the economist in

21:39

a way those are the two for the business elites especially in the and to some extent the educational elites so so i put i put them together and and we basically

21:48

got like the whole story of kind of how it happened, about fear, what Ceausescu and his wife had said, you know, as they were facing the firing squad, you know, basically the whole story, the analytical side of the story and the juicy, interesting, personal, human side of the whole story.

22:10

So that was a very cool way to start a journalistic career. It was quite a long time before I achieved those heights again. So what happens then? How does your career go? I was the Financial Times correspondent in Budapest. I would travel around the region a bit,

22:27

but mainly I was covering the transition from the communist regime through to a free market regime. The stories I actually ended up I mean, I think the story probably I was best at, and this is not a remarkable story or anything like that, but it taught me something.

22:44

The Hungarian telecom company was being privatized, and there were maybe five or six bidders. I think maybe the Germans were in there and some of the baby bells. And somehow, well, because of the FT, being the FT, I was in a strong position. They all wanted to talk to me.

23:01

They all wanted to get their message out through me. the place that everybody came to not just to get their story out but also to trade information so i i built up all of the private information including some stuff that i didn't publish in the newspaper and they would give me a tidbit in exchange

23:26

for a tidbit about you know basically where the bids were going to come in you know who was going to be the most aggressive bidder i mean i suppose it was some kind of Yeah, it was trading. Later on, I think my first domain name I ever bought was News Broker.

23:40

I loved that idea of if you can establish yourself as a meeting place and you're a kind of fair marketplace for ideas.

23:52

then there's a lot of power that comes with that the power of the node in the network that can and you must have realized at this point that that this new technology was arriving you could see it coming at that point which was the internet and the possibility of online journalism uh-huh when did you first figure

24:10

that out when did you first say this is obviously where things are headed

24:14

I mean, it was Wired magazine, and there was another one called Mondo 2000. And Wired wasn't available in Budapest, so I had to get the train every month to Vienna. to pick up a copy of Wired magazine. And then the FT had this online database, the news database, the information database called FT Profile, which was very clunky.

24:36

But I became obsessed by... I bought software because I needed to move the feeds into a FileMaker Pro database. And so I taught myself regular expressions so I could go through the messy feed and then format it. something that later became useful. So I think I was more interested in that side of things than I was.

24:59

At some point, I was kind of a bit bored by the day-to-day of journalism.

25:03

It's just unusual for a journalist reporter to have that kind of fascination with an ability to handle technological ideas, business ideas, drafts. ideas math in some way in a way i was i was a math guy so i did yeah that's unusual for most journalists i think most journalists are not are not gifted that way and

25:30

therefore when someone like me looks at the internet i basically panicked at its technical details whereas you are absolutely fascinated by them and see that as the key key thing and i think that's That's obviously what gave you the edge starting off with this. You could master both the science and technology as well as telling stories and

25:56

finding shit out.

25:59

I always felt that that was a Hungarian Jewish thing. You know, if you actually, if you look at some of the Silicon Valley pioneers like Andy Grove or, you know, the early Hollywood studio executives, I know this because I was writing up the application to this Jewish school for the kids and, you know, trying to think,

26:20

what was my Jewish tradition given that it was not religious? And I really kind of hit upon this that, you know, Hungarian Jews were... They were Hungarian. They read all the books. They wrote the books. Hungarian was their language. They did not speak Yiddish.

26:39

And I think that was probably because Hungarians were kind of barely a majority in the greater Hungary. that stretched to the Carpathian Mountains. And the Hungarians needed all the numbers they could get. So they'd invited Germans in after the Turks decimated the south and middle of the country. And Jews, though not entirely welcome,

27:01

were more able to integrate, a little bit more like Germany than, say, Russia.

27:06

And you had... forefathers in hollywood and in you noted but you noted that they had played a role in i was hollywood and creating silicon valley and all the rest of the okay like

27:17

every every hungary old hungarian jewish lady you ever meet is going to tell you about john von neumann and um and teller and they'll be proud about the hbomb team and how they you know when the when they are when it was a grove the general who ran the show it's like okay now we can talk in

27:36

hungarian you know like when he when he left so you know that's part of the so as

27:41

most jewish people would say you know who's jewish right yeah this would be there's be an extra tinge to that hungarian jewish and but but but the thing that they said is there a single one word for hungarian jew

27:56

I think they called the movement neolog or something like that back in the 19th century. But I think the essential quality is that you might have erudition, but also a populist movement. an eye for what the audiences would want. That would be the Hollywood studio executives.

28:15

Or you might have technical expertise and the ability to manage a company like Andy Grove did in Silicon Valley. So it's the bridging of worlds and the bridging of talents.

28:27

So your bridging of both the worlds of technology and of journalism in the 90s was obviously another right place at the right time. I don't think that was a choice that I made. I mean, it was a choice. No, no, no. It was just where you happened to be and where things were happening. Like me, I mean,

28:45

we didn't choose to be in that generation in which journalism was revolutionized. It just happened to us. And you had a choice as, are we going to be part of this or am I going to just observe it?

28:54

I guess, I mean, the choices I made were getting into derivatives and M&A coverage at the FT. Derivatives, because my math... I'm not a great mathematician, but I can... I understand enough to be able to talk to derivatives traders or people at investment banks.

29:13

And then I guess going to Silicon Valley in 97, just taking a pay cut. They wanted me to go to New York to cover M&A. And I did not want to go to New York to cover M&A. I wanted to be in Silicon Valley. And I was just a very strong homing instinct to go there.

29:34

But before I went there, I actually spent a few months in Singapore. which I think later becomes, now becomes important. Because I was covering the collapse of Barings Bank. Sloppy, old school English institution with very poor risk controls. And I'm in Singapore where the scandal happened. Singaporean authorities were embarrassed that it happened in their financial center

30:03

that they were trying to build up. And the Singaporean officials... you know, as we now, as pretty much everybody knows now, are extremely impressive. Far more impressive than these sloppy aristocrats and the, you know, the second-rate Americans that this English investment bank had hired and the wide boy trader who had somehow

30:30

managed to persuade people that he had found the secret of making money through the flow, but couldn't explain to anybody how he had done it. And Singapore, even then, it was just barely more than 30 years after the founding. Singapore was already more impressive than London. And you start thinking, well, these are overseas Chinese.

30:55

There are more than, I think at the time, there would have been maybe 4 million of them. three million Chinese, Indians, and Malays, and maybe another million Westerners. And so you start thinking, well, if they can do this in Singapore, these are the same people who live in southern China, in Hong Kong, in the Straits of Malacca.

31:19

So this is something. And I think more recently, I've actually kind of come to the conclusion that I think that Singapore is terminus. I think Singapore is terminus, the place where the foundation is established in the Asimov series, that it is the place that had nothing at the end of the world, at the very end of Asia.

31:42

I mean, it did have a, actually, it was an important trading port on sea routes, so actually it did have something. That's an exaggeration there. And Lee Kuan Yew is about as close to Salvo Hardin, the mayor of terminus the kind of one of the more famous characters in the books basically a

32:03

character that's completely mangled in the tv series which i would love to be able

32:07

to hate on in this show um but by all means this is the place to vent

32:15

I think that was a couple of years ago. My friends are very bored of me talking about this, and they like to provoke me by talking about, you know, I didn't think it was so bad.

32:27

It's like talking to Trey Parker about the Indiana Jones remake. It's just that he will not stop.

32:36

And it wasn't that they made Sabo Hardin. So Sabo Hardin is kind of, he's a merchant. He's like a merchant prince. He's the mayor of Terminus. And the mayor is, I think, democratically elected, but basically acts like Lee Kuan Yew, sort of in the interests of the society.

32:52

And it didn't seem like the opposition were ever likely to win. You know, he always transfers both internal and external enemies. And they made the character of a black woman, which was fine by me. But they also made the character into a gun-toting, action-loving... Not quite Lee Kuan Yew.

33:16

No, the famous Salvo Hardin line is, violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. So the whole point of the story is that he wins and the Foundation wins by being smart. Asimov was one of the futurists, a group of writers. I think mainly Jewish, kind of anti-Nazi writers after the Second World War. And, you know,

33:42

he was basically trying to plot a path for, I guess it would have been Western civilization, but it turned out not to be. And then they introduced, I think, in order to get that actor in, they introduced an eternal galactic emperor... The whole point is about predestination, about inevitability.

34:04

And these awful American showrunners just turn the story completely upside down. And it's all meaningless action. And the entire... point of the story is it is lost i'm not the only fan of the original books i'm sure i was disappointed but but i did feel like i was when i go online looking for

34:28

other people who feel like me and you know there's one way to calm down one new york times columnist Paul Krugman, they'd given him a few episodes, and then after two or three, he said, okay, I'm out now. But he's the only person I've ever been able to find.

34:47

So if there's anybody out there who feels like I do, please write to me. Let me know that I'm not alone in this episode. So that's the disappointed fan.

34:56

The fact that you and Paul Krugman are in agreement on something is a little disconcerting, but it suggests to me that it's obviously true. The two of you can come to some consensus on this. Look at the Lee Kuan Yew fans out there.

35:11

I mean, do you know who the Lee Kuan Yew fans are?

35:13

No. Well, I guess, who are they exactly? Tell me. Fill me in on that. I mean, they're basically throughout...

35:22

More intelligent reaches of American business. Charlie Munger, dead now, had a bust of Lee Kuan Yew in his house and regarded Lee Kuan Yew as the greatest nation builder of the 20th century. I think the greatest leaders of the 20th century were Lee Kuan Yew and Deng Xiaoping. I think the juncture,

35:42

if we're going to talk psychohistory here, psychohistory is the term of the science of history and future prediction. So if you're going to look at the juncture, everyone's going to have their own juncture. Maybe you're going to say it's 2008 when Obama should have... had the Wall Street bankers nationalized. They should have been wiped out. They bet.

36:04

They lost. They should have been wiped out. Financialization should have been stopped in its tracks. So you could say that. Sometimes I think that was one. And then, well, obviously, don't do the war on terror. But I think the other one, the one people don't really credit enough, was Deng Xiaoping's visit to Singapore in 1978. Hmm.

36:24

When he goes and he sees, and he sees that it is good, and pragmatist that he was, you know, who cares what color a cat is, whether it's black or white, as long as it catches mice. That kind of Chinese pragmatism, you then see in Shenzhen and Suzhou, and then eventually across the whole of China.

36:48

So, you know, it's not like all of China is... Built on the Singapore model, it's different, it's bigger, it's much more competitive, much more dynamic. Lee Kuan Yew always said that he would never have survived in Chinese Communist Party politics because it's just extremely competitive and a much bigger country.

37:05

I actually don't believe that, but I think he was just being a little modest. He was trying to make the point that China was just such a formidable power. But I think that that was the moment when China's eventual rise to global industrial and economic domination became inevitable.

37:22

And that pretty much the only thing that was going to stop it from beyond that point was nuclear war.

37:28

And that's still something you believe that we are now living in the Chinese century. Oh, not just century era. Walk me through that. Just walk the average person through that who is still sitting here thinking America first. Don't you want to go through? I could, but I'm actually more intrigued. This is an interesting theme to me.

37:53

I mean, we could go through your whole career in Gorka. Let's touch on Gorka when we get to Mosque.

38:02

Because I think the way that Gawker went off the rails in pretty much 2012 to 2015, I would say, was almost exactly... how we see Elon Musk and Joe Rogan, for that matter, anybody that is actually in their own echo chamber, breathing their own fumes, how they go off the rails.

38:27

Let's get back to the Chinese era that we're about to. You saw this coming with the Deng Xiaoping meeting Lee Kuan Yew. What is it about China? What is it about that part of the world that means that it's going to become the greatest global power?

38:45

We talk, they act. You saw the, have you seen the meme online? Is it Xi Jinping? Just a picture of Xi Jinping and it's like, it says, you know, this is alongside screens of screaming Americans woke and anti-woke and all this kind of thing. And it just says, do nothing, win.

39:11

meaning that's all there is meaning you don't talk you act you build you as thanks you said you you hide your light No need to boast. No need to draw attention to the speed with which you're growing. No need to pump up your GDP numbers. No need to show off to the world.

39:35

Some of the bullying in the South China Sea doesn't really quite fit into this model. I'd like to think that Deng Xiaoping would not have... would have said, hey, Vietnam, Philippines, whatever. Cool. We're all cool. You're going to dominate them anyway, economically. You don't need to own every single shoal in the South China Sea. But whatever,

39:56

if you're a great power, you're going to get confident at some point, and maybe you're going to get aggressive, particularly if you went through a century of humiliation from 1850 to 1950. There's a lot of There's a lot of humiliation that China has to work through. England better keep real quiet.

40:17

The idea of Keir Starmer going to China to lecture the Chinese about human rights right now is one of the most brain-dead things I've ever seen in my life. No wonder he got the cold shoulder. Recognize the power relationship. Just be real and recognize what you did. Yes,

40:37

these free ports in Hong Kong and Singapore are probably the best expression of the British Empire. The mercantile tradition, not the settler tradition. There are two Anglos spheres. There's the settler Anglosphere, which I think now we're seeing the poisonous legacy of. And then there's the trading, the free trading side of the Anglosphere.

41:00

Singapore is probably the best remaining... expression of the anglosphere the english language english common law the corporation you know that was anglo and american um basically the best parts of the british system without the adversarial democracy They picked and chose what they wanted from the Western system.

41:31

And that is, if you look at the GDP numbers, that has been the more successful model. Everything I learned at university was that this would not work in the long term. That the second generation, the sun, the second generation would be sloppy and corrupt and they would lose the plot.

41:51

Well, I've been hearing that since the 1980s, and it hasn't happened yet. So when? When is this inevitability?

42:04

The evolution of democracy in the current Chinese system, when is that going to happen?

42:09

No, no. The devolution of the authoritarian democracy that they have, when it becomes corrupt and basically... follows our path rather than their path. The leaders of Singapore remain competent. They are highly paid. They are well-selected. It's like an eternal corporation that maintains the high quality of the bureaucracy. It's a model that the Chinese seem to be following.

42:37

The caliber of their leadership is just phenomenal. In Singapore, you can see it because – well, I can see it because my TikTok is full – some people's TikTok is full of – my TikTok is full of Singaporean officials. Do you really want to admit that in public?

42:53

Yeah, you know what? I'm fine admitting that in public. I'm absolutely fine admitting that in public. I follow their lead. Why should people not listen to this and be slightly chilled? I mean, you seem to be absolutely indifferent to the issue of democracy in these countries or the value of individual rights.

43:17

Singapore has a democracy.

43:18

We're talking about China. Let me talk about Singapore as a model, a direction that China not

43:27

For sure, but at least the big Chinese cities, at least Shanghai, at least the Pearl River Delta, maybe not Beijing, but the megacities, the regional megacities, which are gigantic, which are 60 million people within a one-hour high-speed rail radius from Shanghai over to Nanjing and Ningbo. This is one gigantic city. These are the megacities.

43:54

This is what the East Coast should have been from China. you know, from DC up to Boston, you know, that in, in Asimov's books, you know, New York is a gigantic, it's caves of steel. You know, it's, it stretches complete. It stretches into New Jersey and people zip around on these. No, no,

44:13

now they have to get off the New Jersey transit at Penn station in order to get onto the long Island railroad at Penn station. And the, you know, What everybody else in the world is doing and just having the trains run straight through is in New York completely impossible,

44:28

probably because there are property interests that ensure that people should have to get off and maybe be delayed and wait for their platform to be announced so they might do some shopping. And that is America in a nutshell.

44:41

So defend the Chinese system. I mean, you could definitely defend it as seemingly generating, although from everything I hear, it's wobbling to some extent. Please. Okay.

44:54

I'm sorry, Andrew. Push back. Push back. Oh, I will push back. Just like go and read stuff. You know, go and look at stuff. Go and look at the Xiaomi SU7. Go and look at the Xiaomi SU7. Go and see what Farley from Ford says about it. Go and see what he says about it.

45:14

Well, first of all, it's beautiful. Secondly, it's fast. You know, thirdly, it's produced not in low-wage factories, but it's produced in highly automated factories. BYD, and I don't think they're actually boasting here, you know, they say they're three to five years ahead of Western automakers, and I think they probably include Tesla in that. You know,

45:34

Chinese consumers have not been buying Tesla since way before Musk blew himself up and made the brand toxic because, like... The cars are kind of a little dated now. And the Cybertruck has some issues. Well, it's not even available in China. And if you look at the Chinese car market, for me, this latest phase started with cars.

45:55

I had a car side at Gawker called Jalopnik. I'm actually not that into cars. My husband is more than I am. But I can tell a creative ferment when I see one. I can tell the pace of change. They're doing crazy stuff. They're doing stupid stuff. They've got drones that lift off from the car roofs.

46:15

So I'm not saying that it's all good. I don't like the BYD designs that much. But the fact is they can produce a car. It's a battery company. that can produce a car for about $10,000, a good car. And, you know, Americans can delude themselves that it's all subsidies, but they are deluding themselves.

46:34

The subsidies are no greater than they are in the States. They're just better. They're just better. And it isn't that they just dominate the battery layer of value. that they dominate every single layer of value. The battery, the new battery technologies, the assembly, the... What did they do?

46:57

Tesla boasts about... Musk boasts about reducing parts, which he did. He's about the most Chinese businessman in America was. They'd taken that further. There's a scene in the Iron Man, you know, Musk is called the real life, or he used to be called the real life Iron Man in China. They really respected him.

47:18

He was kind of a hero. They're unironic in what they like. And Iron Man's reactor core is taken out by Jeff Bridges' character who turns out to be, you know, who had been a colleague but is actually evil and trying to use the Iron Man technology for some horrible military purpose.

47:37

And he says something like, did you really think that no one else was going to take your idea? Did you really think that nobody else was going to take your idea? Americans say that China copies. And it did. And it does. And America copies China. And you know who's actually really good on this is Travis Kalanick.

47:59

He went on the All In podcast the other day. And Travis Kalanick is a great and much maligned person. Most people haven't heard of him. The founder of Uber.

48:11

Okay. Maybe you have and I haven't.

48:15

Kara Swisher, who is a toxic person, and the Valley people are absolutely quite right. She's the source of basically all of the malicious gossip within the Valley, or she used to be when she was really plugged in. She would basically bash on the weak company like Yahoo and then spread dirt that

48:32

she couldn't publish for political reasons to other journalists. And I know that because I took a lot of the dirt. And so, and, you know, I think the information flows from like Andreessen's PR people through to Kara Swisher and then out in the world. The Valley investors are playing the game too. I mean, they leak like crazy.

48:53

They just don't like it when the stories don't go their way. They're completely media obsessed because success in the Valley is basically all about establishing yourself in the media's eyes as being the player in a particular category and establishing yourself as kind of the shelling point around which capital and the talent emerge so you

49:14

know part of it is talent and brilliance and all that but part of it is also like pr you know it's pr and basically you know combination, fusion of reputations to create a critical mass around which a company can be built.

49:30

One thought I have listening to you about what's happening in China now and what maybe is that this is actually a pattern with all countries that emerge and develop. You could go to Britain in the 19th century and see extraordinary amounts of industry and planning and inventiveness and creativity and practical experimentation.

49:50

You go to America in the same period, and certainly in the early 20th century, where you have this massive doing. You have a country that's building, that is creating, that is selling, that is manufacturing, that is clearly... But there is a natural... The point at which you've done that and the society matures to some extent and

50:12

can't sustain the energy of the construction pier is what I'm saying.

50:17

Travis Kalanick is one of the very few people who actually, you know, he says, look, they copied us. And he talks about the ferocity of the competition, you know, just how when he was launching Uber in China. Oh, and the reason why I actually despise Kara Swisher is because Travis Kalanick, who is a dynamic, She trashed him.

50:37

He said something about, kind of, I guess semi-ironically, about being a terrible person. And she just said tabloid style, just... Travis Glanick, who says he's a terrible person, Trump style, like a little moniker that's used every single time his name comes up. And it's trashy. He was a great and is a great American entrepreneur.

51:00

America needs more of them. And he deserves some respect. I've actually never met him. I have no vested interest in this. But I was impressed by the fact that he could take on all these lobbies, all these taxi lobbies, and actually get a company like that established. It's a very, very hard thing to do.

51:15

You have to do it really fast. Yes, you do have to play the game a little rough. You have to play politics as well as everything else. And that's just how it goes. And so if you actually want any innovation, you need people like Travis Kalanick. You need people like Palmer Luckey.

51:29

And look, they can be criticized and all that, but you've got to know where you're talented. And you're talking about the cycle of societies, which is a concept that the Chinese have very strongly. the cycle of dynasties it's a long cycle it's several hundred years which is why

51:51

you shouldn't say Chinese century you should say Chinese era because this could well be this could well be the one in the game of risk there's a moment when one player particularly if they've been wise enough to bide their time and hide their light as Deng Xiaoping said there's a moment when one player conquers the entire planet.

52:16

I don't think they're going to conquer the entire planet. Their strategy seems to be more industrial and economic and through trade than anything else.

52:24

So you do see the cycle of the Chinese era emerging in the Western era in eclipse. I think that's obvious. Well, it's not obvious to everyone. Tell me why. And in this, let me just challenge you on the one basis. You are now just empirically saying this. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

52:46

I'm not going to say whether it's a good thing or a bad thing. It just is. Well, I'm going to ask you again. Do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing?

52:57

I think when I realized that China was going to win, obviously, one toy is a long time ago. I remember some family friend who had a toy factory in Wales in the Hungarian Jewish community. And I remember him talking about the impossibility of competing with China back in the 19, as a kid, back in the 1970s.

53:20

And I think initially they produced in China. And I think he ended up running a little store importing kitchen equipment from China. And then there was drones. So I know if you talk to Chris Anderson, who once edited Wired magazine, he'll talk about the impossibility of competing with China in drones. Drones is not a trivial technology.

53:41

It's a military technology. It's an essential military technology of the next century. So these Chinese drone shows. You know, thousands of synchronized drones, you know, flying, lifting up over cyberpunk cities. You know, that is propaganda. That is, you know, you're going to lose any war that you fight with us. Palmer Luckey makes the point that. Shipbuilding.

54:10

Do you know the ratio? He asked this question of the podcast who was actually interviewing him. Do you know what the ratio of Chinese ship production is to American ship production? Just make a guess.

54:24

I would say it's 10 to 1. Go higher. 50 to 1. Go higher. 100 to 1. Go higher. 500 to 1. 350. Wow. Wow. We think we're going to defend Taiwan from them? Yeah, I know. It's a joke.

54:43

Well, Trump, to his credit, Trump is at least not delusional about that. He has a sense of power. He has a sense of who he can bully and who he needs to suck up to. Trump knows that he has to make a deal on Taiwan. And if the deal had been done before,

54:58

maybe you could have got Korean reunification in exchange for Chinese unification. But now that's not going to be possible.

55:09

What do you think is the, so in your view, the central reason for the Chinese era is simply a matter of cycles, or is it just that? Obviously, they have numbers, too, which is kind of astonishing, but they also have some demographic challenges with that. Everybody around the world has demographic challenges.

55:29

But they seem to have a particularly... Let me read you something from the Asimov Foundation. This is not completely a new idea. So, the fall of empire. I can't remember who... Is this a Selden speech... I think it may be a seldom speech in Foundation. I think they may have actually even used this in the show.

55:53

But please don't use the show thing because that's a terrible show. The fall of empire is a massive thing. I posted this just as I left the States back at the end of 2016, beginning of 2017. It's a massive thing and not easily fought. It is dictated by a rising bureaucracy.

56:16

a receding initiative, a freezing of caste, a damning of curiosity. The rotten tree trunk, until the very moment when the storm blast breaks it in two, has all the appearance of might it ever had. The storm blast whistles through the branches of the empire even now. The empire will vanish, and all it's good with it.

56:39

Its accumulated knowledge will decay and the order it has imposed will vanish. Interstellar wars will be endless. Interstellar trade will decay. Population will decline. Worlds will lose touch. I do not say that we can prevent the fall, but it is not yet too late to shorten the interregnum which will follow.

57:00

So that's basically the line, the passage from the book. I mean, that's back in, what is it? That would have been 19... It would have been 1945 that he wrote that. So I mean at that time, did he see that? I don't know whether he saw that. I mean Sagan saw it. In what Sagan said?

57:21

I can't even remember it exactly, but there's a famous Carl Sagan premonition, I think close to the time that he was dying, that he saw a time when America would be distracted and consumed by the media that it produced. That it would lose... Just the very, very fact that Elon Musk is high at Mar-a-Lago...

57:49

After he's been demoted on the Thursday, tweeting through the night, it looked like, looking at the timestamps, when his company is... The cars are literally burning. The showrooms are literally burning. No, maybe not burning. It's certainly attacked. There's swastika. Darren sent me a picture of a swastika on a Cybertruck in downtown New York the other day.

58:16

And more importantly than that, he's getting his ass kicked, not just by one Chinese company, by a whole bunch of Chinese companies who are probably more concerned competing against each other than they are about competing against him. Like the Chinese joke that, you know, actually like the real contest is not between China or the United States.

58:36

It's between Pearl River Delta and, you know, the greater Shanghai, Yangtze Delta.

58:42

So Musk is a kind of symbol for you of America going, disappearing up its own asshole, as it were.

58:49

Well, I mean, in a way he's not because he was the greatest hope. Right. Right. One of our boys' names, middle name, and this is not after him, but it didn't matter to us that it was his name. His middle name is Elon. I was absolutely an admirer of Elon Musk.

59:14

I still am an admirer of his career. To have one achievement as great as pioneering electric cars, I don't care whether people say that he came in as the businessman, somebody else invented it, whatever. He made it happen. He made that happen. He made SpaceX happen, which, apart from technical achievement,

59:33

is a massive economic achievement that has dramatically reduced the cost of space travel. It has absolutely brought close to the moment of interplanetary exploration and maybe settlement of another planet, or at least the South Pole of the Moon, or maybe some space stations. That would be cool. Some rotating space stations like we saw in 2001 AD.

59:56

It's 2025 now. We're 24 years later. We're behind schedule on some of this stuff. And then the Starlink. Again, global internet. Any one of those things would be enough to make somebody's name, and he had three. There is nobody I know even who had two. So if you look at the great scorecard of technological achievement,

1:00:23

he's right up there, up at the top, above anybody from China up until this point. But the problem for him is that he's one man. And he's up against... Well, 1.4 billion people, of whom a significant percentage are extremely intelligent and dynamic. And he's up against 20 electric car companies in China.

1:00:47

And BYD, like I say, is kind of a little clunky, but Xiaomi is everything, you know? It's better than Apple and smartphones.

1:00:55

But that's true independently of whether he's doing K all night tweeting. What has happened to him? What has happened to Musk? And is that in any way emblematic what's happening to all of us in America? I mean, I have a theory, but I don't know. I haven't talked to him.

1:01:14

Well, let's air the theory. My theory is that it's displacement activity. He's a problem solver. He has an engineering mindset. He's a problem solver. I recognize that. And faced with an insoluble problem, like how do you compete with China when your base is in the United States?

1:01:36

How do you compete with Chinese companies when your base is in a country that has basically been financialized and Baumol cost inflated? to death to the point where it doesn't really have any you know it doesn't have the engineers to run to set up and to set up factories setting up factories isn't so

1:01:57

hard palmer palmer lucky says the hard part is actually finding the people to run them and when the smartest kids are going into finance or you know they're making youtubes or are the smartest kids going into podcasts but maybe But when none of them go into, in the manufacturing classes and the physics classes, people have said, like,

1:02:21

for years, it's been all Chinese, you know, in the States. And now the price for that is being paid, about to be paid.

1:02:31

So rather than face these, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, rather than face these insoluble problems.

1:02:40

No, he's trying the easier task, or what he thinks is the easier task, or maybe the necessary task of reforming America. You know, maybe he, it's like he can't compete from the America as is.

1:02:54

He needs to change America in order to be able to compete. But he clearly, nothing that we can see him doing is going to have any impact on any of that. I mean, it's trivial at this point.

1:03:07

It's too much too late, too fast.

1:03:09

You know, the time for this would have been 2008. I think it's too little too late, too fast. I mean, if 86% of the budget is off out not in under your control the idea you're going to end debt is absurd well no and thursday when he's reduced from a chainsaw to a scalpel

1:03:28

right is indicative of that um and the fact is if you're going to do a restructuring of the american government like you need to you know thatcher before thatcher came to power in 79 i was a big thatcher fan i had to keep that very quiet

1:03:41

during university like i was completely taboo uh the same here for you Of course. I was a huge Thatcher fan. A huge Thatcher fan. I mean, like, actually, finally, somebody actually trying to do something. Yes. Like somebody trying to make Britain great again.

1:03:56

Get back again. Yeah, exactly. Somebody who actually hadn't just accepted decline as an inevitable thing. Yeah, I found it exhilarating. If you lived in 1970s Britain, for fuck's sake, it was like living in a mausoleum, essentially, in which all the new buildings – anyway, let's not show you.

1:04:14

She did. And she did. Look, it wasn't it wasn't enough, but it was enough for like it was a good 20 years of of, you know, under Thatcher and then Blair. Yeah. Because he because he was a successor. You know, he was the right wing social democracy, a big Lee Kuan Yew fan, by the way,

1:04:30

which I'm sure isn't good for his. But, you know, that's that's his politics, like it or not, you know, and he was a good prime minister, like it or not. Yeah. And, you know, current Labour government, not completely terrible in the UK. You know, at least they're finally doing something about housing.

1:04:46

So quite why it's taken up to this point for the left in both the US – well, the US is far behind. But, you know, they actually seem to be serious about making it easier to build houses.

1:05:00

Do you think this is where Musk and Teal are – they want to rescue Western civilization? Is that what they're doing? Yeah. I want to know what's in their heads. I'd like to ask some member of Doge, what are you trying to do? I don't understand it, to be honest with you.

1:05:18

I think he believes he's trying to save Western civilization.

1:05:23

Yeah. It's hard. Yeah. You know, I think give them actually a little bit, just a little bit. It's not going to work. But they are trying to do something. It's not going to work. It's disorganized. I don't know whether Trump is really fully behind it. You know, Vivek got fired for basically telling the truth about Native Americans.

1:05:50

I mean, white Native Americans. And, you know, Musk got kneecapped last week and still was ligging Going to Mar-a-Lago, anyone with any self-respect would be out of there and back to your companies and

1:06:04

try to save them. It is impossible to have self-respect if you work for Trump. I think that's the general view that eventually emerges. He will destroy it or he'll make it impossible for you to respect yourself.

1:06:15

Well, at the point at which Trump starts to consider, I don't know what the market cap level is of this. Maybe it's when it goes below $100 billion. Oh, I should say that I'm extremely, I'm short Tesla. So I'm a motivated arguer here. Okay? Yep. Thank you for the full disclosure.

1:06:34

And I'm very, and I'm along BYD, Xiaomi, and Tencent. Right. So those are my biggest traits. So that should be clear. Where were we? To Teal and Musk. Teal is very interesting. Teal is smarter.

1:06:52

Let's just give the listeners a very brief background of it. Basically, Gorka kind of outed him. He got really pissed at Gorka for kind of outing him. Let me tell you. I don't want to get into all of it again, but let's just say. No, no.

1:07:07

It's actually more interesting than that. My theory is that the stories he didn't like, he was in partnership with Elon Musk at PayPal. And when I wrote ValueWag, that was kind of another Nexus moment. when there was no real competition and for maybe six months or 12 months value wag

1:07:30

was on all the computer screens and they were all writing in with their tips including lots of stuff that i couldn't use you know like boring stuff about who was having an affair with whom it's like that's not interesting like like give me

1:07:43

some power gossip i'm not interested in that other kind of gossip like i want the real i want tradable information you know i don't want Like chitchat. So I did a story about how Teal had had Musk thrown out of PayPal, or there'd been a revolt against Musk and PayPal.

1:08:06

And I don't think that was the official... They said it was inaccurate. Maybe this is... There's some truth to it, let me say. And their perfect copybook histories are very important to them. Everything has to be just one success after another. And so the idea that even in a glorious career,

1:08:24

you might have a little bit of mess was not something that they could really comprehend. And the fact is that Musk was... I later became an admirer, especially with SpaceX and electric cars. But back then, he hadn't really done that much. But Thiel was kind of a hero of mine. That's true.

1:08:46

His politics and mine are not that far apart. Actually, he obviously knows what's happening. He's kept his distance from this administration, if you've noticed. He said he wasn't going to fund anybody in the cycle. And at the moment of maximum power... when his guy Vance worked for him as vice president.

1:09:08

Trump, you know, of whom he was the biggest business backer, is president. Musk, his former business partner, is the richest man in America and, you know, a co-president. David Sachs, the crypto czar, like another person with South African connections, also part of the, they call it the PayPal mafia.

1:09:26

You know, the PayPal mafia kind of run America in many ways right now. They're It's a little unfortunate they actually allowed themselves. They kind of liked to be called PayPal Mafia. They might come back to haunt them at some later point. Anyway, he's actually smart enough to be keeping a little bit of distance from this.

1:09:44

Have you seen anything from him? No, really, no.

1:09:47

He has been kind of quiet. Have you seen much from Andreessen? Well, he seems to be actually tilting against Trump. No, he's not.

1:09:57

He's just quiet. No, he's actually not completely quiet. He said some stuff about the H-1Bs the other day. So a little bit of MAGA pleasing stuff, but nothing to associate himself too closely. So people are playing all kinds of delicate games right now, trying to be cooperative enough and collaborative or chime in if it's the

1:10:25

universities or trans. That's an easy one. So say something mean about trans people. Are you going to say something mean about trans people, Andrew? Doesn't that all seem like a bit of a distraction, that whole woke, anti-woke thing now? Isn't that just like another thing that America got distracted by over the last 20 years?

1:10:50

That plus the war on terror. Complete waste of time. All it is is just an indicator of a society that is not united. that is distracted by its own internal conflicts while China rises quietly and steadily year after year looking on and presumably in their own way amused by how

1:11:10

easy this is. If you have no interest in democratic values and all the other things that the West seems to believe in, or says they believe in, then you can see why your analysis... Well, you could take it in two ways. One is just a very realistic view of what's happening, regardless of whether it's good or bad.

1:11:31

This is your prediction. On the other hand, a lot of us would say, no, there are some things we'd rather have than be the most powerful... country in the world. We'd rather live in a free country. We'd rather have property rights. We'd rather live in a slightly more cumbersome society.

1:11:48

You think there are no property rights in Singapore?

1:11:52

We're talking about China, at least secure. And there is a difference between the ability to have a podcast like this, the United States, the ability to have such a podcast in China. There are obviously massive differences between...

1:12:08

Do you seriously think that property rights are secure in the United States? Property rights are enforced by law. Law in the United States is a matter of who has the most money to pay the lawyers. That's all there is. Peter Thiel said it quite clearly. A single-digit millionaire cannot get justice in this country.

1:12:25

He said that in the context of the Hogan case. Who said that? Peter Thiel said a single-digit millionaire cannot get justice in this country. That's absolutely true. A single-digit millionaire in competition with a billionaire or a corporation or an insurance company cannot get justice in the United States.

1:12:43

So please don't lecture me about the United States and its kind of great value.

1:12:46

I'm not lecturing you. I am simply pointing out that there are values other than economic power. I mean,

1:12:55

I think those values probably find best expression in Scandinavia and in Switzerland, where I lived after the Teal-funded legal campaign. I basically sat out the Trump years in Switzerland and traveling to Asia. And Switzerland works. It absolutely works. It's a local democracy. No one knows who the president is. It's a council.

1:13:18

And so you don't get the kind of you don't get the popular. The far right has been the strongest party in Switzerland for 15 years or something like that. They're not a majority. Far right. The right in Switzerland has been the largest party. Everybody lives perfectly well. And actually,

1:13:40

they have managed to maintain a relatively consensus-driven society and even high rates of immigration without falling apart. And they have a democracy that's much more real than a democracy anywhere else.

1:13:54

How about Orbán and Hungary, where you are? Let's also talk about Europe as a whole. We haven't talked about it very much with the debate about America and China. Tell us what you sense right now in Europe. Obviously, there's a certain amount of reeling from the Trump position on everything, essentially.

1:14:17

Trump is the great nation builder. He's the great nation builder. La Presidenta Sheinbaum in Mexico has 80% approval ratings. If you've ever watched any of her videos or you see the picture of her, there's an iconic picture of her that came out last week. I guess there's some kind of... It can't be Holy Week, can it? No.

1:14:40

But there was some big... Ash Wednesday, maybe? Maybe Ash Wednesday.

1:14:44

I don't know. You're the... I'm the papers, too. That's not a celebration.

1:14:51

She radiates quiet power. And if you notice, Trump does not really mess with Mexico. He doesn't mess with Mexico. He doesn't mess with Mexico that much. What? He's going to bloody well invade them.

1:15:03

He's thrown every tariff that he can their direction. Tell me what he's done recently. He backed off the tariffs. Has he backed off all the tariffs?

1:15:14

I don't think so. He backed off most of the Mexico tariffs, yes. I mean, he might try to put them on again. But let's get to Europe. Canada and Europe. And Europe. So let's talk about Europe. Look, there's the superficial stuff, you know, Macron, you know, the EU doing their usual talky-talky stuff.

1:15:34

But then there's some real stuff going on. You know, Tusk and Poland. To my mind, leader of Europe. Move the capital from Brussels to Warsaw. New Europe. Old Europe is tired. Their promises to back Ukraine are, as Orban says, empty. Basically egging the Ukrainians on with rhetoric and with aid, but when it comes down to it,

1:16:00

are they going to station troops in Lviv? Not. Would the Poles station troops in Lviv? Yes, they would. The Poles were stationed troops in western Ukraine. The Romanians were probably stationed troops in Moldova. You might even get them to take over Transnistria, which is basically a little Russian enclave in between Ukraine and Moldova.

1:16:22

They probably would like to secure as far as Odessa. Because the Romanians don't want Russians right up against their border. I mean, they've got their own issues now. But there are powers in Europe that are willing to fight. The Scandinavians are willing to fight.

1:16:36

The Poles are willing to fight. It is Starmer and Macron have proposed a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. That's not nothing, is

1:16:44

Good luck to Macron with the weakness that he has. The national rally might be kind of on the team now when it comes to this, but they just had a massive Mélenchon demonstration against war in Paris. And the German Greens just refused to support the constitutional amendment. the German Greens,

1:17:07

the most useless party in the whole of Europe and maybe in the whole world, you know, that basically led the whole world down an anti-nuclear path, have never apologized for that, have never even recognized what a terrible error it was. And, you know, and that plus the combination of their, you know,

1:17:25

their aggressive human rights centered Ukraine policy combined with the reluctance to back it up with any kind of military force, has left German industry with super high energy prices at the same time as it faces intense life-threatening competition from China and threaten entirely the German economic miracle of the 20th century.

1:17:47

So, yes, they are the worst party on the planet. They should hang their heads in shame. But Tusk, You know, Tusk actually has, you know, he's the one who said, you know that great line he has? You know, it's like, why the hell? I don't think he said why the hell,

1:18:03

but should 500 million Europeans be begging 300 million Americans for help fighting 100 million Russians who can't even beat 40 million Ukrainians?

1:18:18

Yes.

1:18:21

It's a psychological problem that Europe has. It's not a material problem. The very best thing for Europe would be for America to withdraw from Europe. The very best thing. For Europe to stand on its own two feet and for those... They talk about the coalition of the willing. Let the willing take the lead in Europe.

1:18:40

France is not capable... Macron might be individually, but France is politically not capable. It's got far too many of its own issues, largely arising from immigration and an unaddressed pensions crisis. But Poland could absolutely... The UK?

1:18:57

Does anything work? Do the nukes work? You tell me. Apparently, the nukes don't even work, right? They've had trouble.

1:19:06

I don't know. I think maybe they do, but maybe they don't. But the fact is that England has been America's lapdog. The whole of Europe existed under Russian domination. I'm going to say Russian domination because the Russians have been invading Eastern Europe. They invaded as far as Paris. You know, they quashed the revolution in Hungary in 1848.

1:19:27

You know, it's not the Soviets. It's Russian expansionism. I love Russians as people when they are out of Russia. But Russia is a toxic country. You know, it's as toxic as any of these natural resources countries. The reason why probably Trump identifies with it is because America is rapidly on the track to becoming, you know,

1:19:47

a kind of revisionist natural resource country. Would be a colony if it didn't have nukes. So, of course, they have a commonality of interest. Take away Silicon Valley. Take away Hollywood. What do you have?

1:20:06

How best can you counter Russia, in your opinion? And do you think that where Russia is now, as you just said, unable to even defeat Ukraine and having to bring in North Korean conscripts to help them fight, that doesn't seem a terribly threatening proposition for Europe? The Finns will fight. The Swedes will fight.

1:20:27

The Poles will fight. The Ukrainians are fighting. The Turks will fight. That's quite enough. You know... The Poles need nuclear weapons, whether the French will give it to them or somebody else will give it to them. Battlefield nuclear weapons. They already intend to mine the entire border. The Finns intend to mine the entire border.

1:20:51

Put Turkish troops into Georgia.

1:20:54

That sounds like a recipe for international calm. Yeah.

1:20:59

What? Why not? You mean basically declare war on Russia? No. Why is Turkish support of Georgia, a country that has been invaded by Russia, Turkey has beaten Russia in two wars in the last two years, in Armenia and in Syria. Turkey is not afraid of Russia. Russia has nukes. Yes, that's scary.

1:21:20

But if you've got nukes yourself, just like Russian nukes have been scary for a long time. And the military strategy of the West from 1945 on was not to match Russia in conventional arms, but basically to have a conventional force, which if overrun would use battlefield nuclear weapons.

1:21:37

And there was credibility of escalation that ensured that the Russians wouldn't push their conventional advantage. That was the strategy for 40 years. So I don't see why it shouldn't be the strategy now. And, you know, don't bother even asking the French and the Spanish and the Italians to contribute to this effort.

1:21:57

Like, they're far away from the border. They don't have the same interest and the same, like, it's ludicrous to pretend that every single European country is going to feel the existential threat that the Finns feel or the Poles feel. The Poles had 20,000, the cream of their youth, their officer corps, you know,

1:22:17

killed by the russians lying in graves and they will never ever forget that you know they've been occupied by the russians they will never ever reconcile to the russians when when tucker carson interviewed putin do you remember how you know when you have that famous interview where he kind of goes back to the very you know

1:22:35

the very first czar and gives you the kind of great history lesson and all that kind of stuff and who does he talk about like who winds him up the most It's the Poles. Of course it's the Poles. The Poles have always been the Russian enemy. And they know and see the Russians for who they are.

1:22:54

And they will never, ever be occupied again. So they are willing. Let them lead. That's my view.

1:23:01

I found a really, really fascinating interaction between Elon and Ruddock Sikorsky. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Who started that? I think Ruddock. No, no, the little man one. The quiet little man. Quiet little man. Did he say quiet little man? He said quiet little man.

1:23:23

Look it up. I think he said little man. I don't think he said quiet little man. I think he said quiet little man. But you know the terrible thing about... You tell me what you found. I mean, I thought that was actually the biggest strategic error they had made.

1:23:38

Greenland and Denmark, I kind of see the point of that from their point of view. It's a betrayal of Denmark that sent troops, has been a loyal ally of the United States for decades, and sent troops to Iraq. They sent troops to Afghanistan, too. I think they sent troops to both. And troops who died.

1:23:56

The Danes have been an exemplary nation for decades. They were also exemplary against the Nazis. Oh. Like, don't fuck with Denmark. That makes me angry. Well, I feel the same way about Canada, for fuck's sake. I mean, it's like it was a joke at one point. They just want to piss off everyone. Yes, here it is.

1:24:17

Here's the actual quote. Okay, tell me. Be quiet, small man. Oh, be quiet. Be quiet, small man. I thought you said quiet little man. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's right. To the foreign minister of... I can't remember him now. Is Radek still the... No, he's not. What is he now? Anyway, I don't know what Radek is.

1:24:33

I knew Radek... I've known Radek for decades. I knew him at Oxford. He is... One of the foremost Atlanticists. Of course he is. These people are picking the Atlanticists and dissing them. It's amazing. It is as if they want to make an enemy of everyone. Except for China. Except for China.

1:24:54

They recognize, I mean, basically it is, the lesson here is you must take power and you must exercise power if you are to get respect. And to that extent, Trump is a great nation builder. I thank him. Of other people, of other nations. Of other nations, yes. He will finally make Europe. He will finally make Europe.

1:25:20

He might even give England the path back into Europe. He is actually performing a very constructive role. I don't think necessarily it's going to turn out the way he wanted it to turn out.

1:25:32

It's a bit like Putin was a nation builder in Ukraine. In some ways, Ukraine never felt the level of identity as separate as they have since they were attacked by these bastards. They have earned their nationhood. Yeah, they have. And what did you make of the meeting in the White House between Trump and France?

1:25:53

But first of all, let's talk about the even more terrible thing, which was Rubio. Rubio is an intelligent man. He sees the rise of China. He knows that America needs to be there for... If America isn't simply to withdraw into a continental fastness, it needs to be present in Asia-Pacific,

1:26:16

which probably at this point means only Korea and Japan. I think everything else just assumed... Southeast Asia is in the Chinese zone already. I think that rail connection between China and Vietnam was the... was the final or the isn't it isn't finished yet but it's it's the final link you

1:26:35

know vietnam obviously has historic reasons to be suspicious of china and with that railway announcement they were basically making they were making their choice so the american empire in asia is down to australia korea and japan now chinese just did a circumnavigation of australia with a small fleet i saw that what american reaction was that to that

1:27:00

I thought nothing, right? Nothing. The Australians are beginning to figure this out too. Well, they've actually always been quite smart about China. No, about America is what I'm saying. Oh, about America. That's what they have to be slightly surprised by, that there is no, rather like the Ukrainians, they'll suddenly look around and say, where are you?

1:27:21

And they're not there. Well, Palmer Luckey actually, Palmer Luckey,

1:27:25

everybody should actually watch that interview he did. I forget the guy's name, the podcaster. It's super interesting. Basically, it tells you everything. Yeah, it's market moving stuff if anyone was going to pay attention.

1:27:40

Would you map out the next four years under Trump in the world? Do you think he's going to come to some grand agreement with China or sort of let's not mess up? I mean, it seems to me Taiwan is an obvious deal. Some trade or something or other. But I don't know what he gets in return.

1:27:59

Oh, what, TSMC?

1:28:02

Is that the deal? That would be, I mean, at least we'd have a, we wouldn't be, you know, we wouldn't be as vulnerable as we used to be.

1:28:09

And they'll probably overtake in three years anyway. So maybe that's a deal they would do. It's like, okay, you take it. Let's see what you can do with it. You're slow.

1:28:22

We'll catch you up anyway. So at the end of these four years, you anticipate what exactly, do you think? I mean, I'm actually a little... It's kind of a tragedy, really.

1:28:35

I feel sorry for Trump in some ways. This is not on him. This is happening on his watch. And maybe he's accelerating it with this kind of spastic administration that... you know, it's writhing around without direction. And, you know, or it's like, I don't know,

1:28:53

it's like a machine and they're pulling the levers that maybe worked back in 2017, but they sure as hell don't work now. You know, every single tariff is counterproductive because America's too dependent on overseas suppliers. And, you know, you talk too much and the stock market falls and he pretends he doesn't care about the stock market falling,

1:29:11

but he can't handle a 10% drop in the S&P. So I assume that the bazooka is about to come out. which will temporarily alleve matters. The bazooka meaning what? The money hose, a bullied Fed that basically goes in and directly or indirectly supports the stock market. America has been run like a giant pension fund.

1:29:39

Silicon Valley is a giant pension fund in which the earnings are pumped. It's like, you know, it's exactly like General Electric in the late 20th century. You know, gradually financialized, nicely, ever steadily increasing earnings, massaged numbers. And, you know, whatever, gee, finance rises to, what was it at its peak?

1:30:07

30, 40, 50% of total profits or something like that. You know, basically a banking business. And then at the end of it, oh, oops, it's a husk. So, I mean, I assume that's going to be America at some point. Well, I mean, it's Silicon Valley. There's some great companies in America.

1:30:25

America has so many intrinsic advantages.

1:30:30

It's got space. It's got gigantic warehouses. It's got a nationwide highway network. I think Texas is fine. You know, fracking, oil. I think the natural resources parts of the country are fine. You know, that guy Chamath, the SPAC guy who's on the All In podcast, he basically just announced he was short Wall Street, long Main Street.

1:30:53

I'm not sure what that really means. Is he buying up land or property or... you know, or fracking or ever selling Silicon Valley and, you know, maybe the more speculative stuff. I don't know. Somebody should ask him. But, like, I assume... Some of these Texas supermarket chains are just – I remember reading some piece about, like,

1:31:18

during the pandemic, how, you know, they had almost, like, early warning of the pandemic. Just very well-organized businesses. You know, Walmart was a – yeah, Amazon warehouses, logistics, like – I sold my Amazon stock the other day, and I was really sad to do so, because it's a great company and very, very hard to replicate.

1:31:37

But I just feel that all these Valley companies are going to be tarnished with the same brush. And when people turn, they already are turning against them, that they're going to turn against... all of them indiscriminately when they shouldn't. Meta is a more dynamic company and Zuckerberg is a more dynamic leader than many of the others have.

1:31:57

Microsoft has good leadership at the moment. There are some good companies. I think Apple is a question for many of the same reasons that Tesla is a question. All their stuff is made in China. Duh.

1:32:12

As Palmer, like he says, I'm not going to. We're waiting for the $3,000 iPhone, which is going to arrive in a few months. And we'll see. Of course, the other thing is that when Trump is presented with a collapsing growth rate and rising inflation, I don't know what he's going to do.

1:32:30

Well, he's going to pop up the stock market. Yeah. Like he says that he doesn't care about the stock market. He does care about the stock market. But will that add to inflation repression? Yes, it will. So what do you think those parties are going to be like at Mar-a-Lago?

1:32:45

I'm extremely happy never to even think about going to any of them.

1:32:49

You know what I do now? I find myself watching for eye contact at those dinners and then videos and stuff like that. And who comes down after Trump on the plane for signs of, you know, like it looked for a little bit.

1:33:05

You see in the cabinet meeting, he kind of basically, he touches Rubio's arm as in like, Okay, I know this guy's an idiot, but just, like, don't blow up on TV here, please, Marco.

1:33:17

He even said, I think, in his speech to Congress, you know, Marco's responsible for that, so let's hope he works out okay. He's already telling people he wants to... But what is it, the sheer psychology of Marco Rubio, what is in his head? I think he's...

1:33:33

I mean, that Radek Sikorsky, like him chiming in on, you know, the Radek, oh, Poland should be grateful or say thank you or whatever. All this stuff about saying thank you. I mean, shut the fuck up. You know, you say thank you. You say thank you. Like we've been your allies and you've treated us with complete disrespect.

1:33:57

England sent troops. And what, we're some no-name country that hasn't fought a war in 40 years? We fought your war. When 9-11 happened, every single person in England that I could tell felt like they had, they felt, I moved to New York after that. Because I felt it.

1:34:16

I felt I wanted to be in the imperial capital that had been attacked by these barbarians. The West was a thing. It was truly a thing. English people have always had a divided loyalty between the West as a whole, the Euro-Atlantic, the Atlantic space, and the smaller Europe. I mean, I felt that myself.

1:34:37

America was the more dynamic. I always thought of America as the more dynamic extension of Europe. Not anymore. You know what? Europe should do the same thing to X that America did to TikTok. Divest. Divest to a local owner. X in Europe should be used only by people with European telephone numbers. You register your telephone number.

1:35:05

You can be anything in Europe. You can be a far leftist, you can be a far rightist, whatever. Free speech within Europe. I think the Australians have the right idea. No foreign intervention in Australian politics. You can go to jail for that. Do that and these nutters will withdraw from Europe in a heartbeat.

1:35:24

Musk is intervening in the internal politics of European countries one after the other. Ireland, Denmark, Romania, Germany, every single country in Europe he is intervening. Who is he? Steve Bannon says he's an illegal immigrant. He's an illegal immigrant in America. It comes from South Africa, you know, a settler colonialist family from South Africa, you know,

1:35:50

with a weird history, not of Nazism, as some people say, but, you know, this technate that his grandfather was involved with, this North American super state, you know, which goes, you know, actually is pretty much exactly the Trump territorial demands down to Panama, you know, up through Canada to Greenland. I think he will get Greenland, actually. Yeah.

1:36:12

I think he will get Greenland because it looks big on the map. And if the Chinese are smart enough, they'll know that they have to give him something. He has to have his win. Got to be winning. Taiwan for Greenland. Yeah, maybe that's it. Then you've got Canada surrounded.

1:36:33

Alaska, Greenland. It's a sheer whiplash of being a Canadian at this point. And now he's making them register to enter the country. I mean, it is as if they have been a longstanding foe.

1:36:48

I think it's all in-end politics, as the Germans say. It's all domestic politics. The thing about Canada, the thing that makes it an attractive target, is that it's kind of representative of the Democratic Party. You know, like if Canada was voting in U.S. elections, and this is why it will never be, well,

1:37:04

they'll never make every single Canadian province into a state because that would be whatever.

1:37:08

No, they'd be overwhelmed. Maybe the Democratic majority forever.

1:37:12

Forever, yeah. So they can't do that. That's why probably they say the 51st state, you only get one state.

1:37:18

I think even then they'd be pretty, with the population, between them and California, I think it's kind of over. They'd be Democrat, but it's only two extra senators, you know. Nick, this has been a somewhat sobering hour and a half. Why are you laughing? Because it's however sobering,

1:37:38

you managed to bring a certain amount of amusement to it and a kind of laughing on the deck of the Titanic feel that is certainly welcome here. I'm sorry if I haven't been able to really push back all the way I might have. I was just absorbing what you had to say.

1:37:54

I hope I didn't talk over you.

1:37:56

No one talks over you. I just got a little passionate there for a bit. I love passion, Nick. And I talk over – I have to shut the fuck up on these things. I talk too much on these things. I need to control myself.

1:38:10

I mean I'm leaving the States, but I think I have to do one last trip back. I'm a green card holder. Watch what you say. I know.

1:38:22

Nothing about Israel. We might get somebody arriving at your door from a 1952 law that was passed originally to target Holocaust survivors who may have suspected of being communists. Seriously? That is the law that they are using. Seriously? Yes. That's nuts. It feels like it's a literal McCarthy era law. It is literally there.

1:38:47

They didn't use any of the other ones. They didn't use anything for the 21st century. They didn't accuse him of a crime. They just said, we think you're commies. And so we're going to go back to this 52 law where we could just say, we feel like we don't want to go away. And that's it.

1:39:03

It feels like I remember reading something about the Roman Empire towards the end

1:39:06

that people would leave for their, you know, as it all got shaky. Yeah. People would leave for their home provinces. Apparently, Hispania was a good place to go. I guess the barbarians weren't going to reach that far. And North Africa, I think, was a good place to go. At least half the Europeans I know have left now.

1:39:31

Left America, you mean? Uh-huh. Yeah.

1:39:34

Maybe this is a selection. The people who were living here, working here, and they've now decamped.

1:39:40

Yeah, I had a whole European crew when I first arrived in New York. And some of it is just cost. It's just a very hard place to raise a family. But I think that's kind of like, I guess it's the divorce.

1:39:58

It is a divorce. It pains me. It does. It feels like your parents are fighting. But Europe has choices. I know, and I hope they make them. And the weird thing, as you say, is that Trump's kind of empowering some of them. I mean, he's rescued Stalin, it seems, temporarily.

1:40:19

He's rescued people all over politics. Yeah, I know. But that's kind of it, isn't it? Everything he does... The pushback is actually stronger than the push. The levers don't work. Palmer, like he says, is American military support really credible anymore? What exactly is America offering?

1:40:42

China is offering BYD factories and rail links and integration with the supply chain, the world's greatest supply chain. The rate that America is going right now, it's going to be on the periphery of the giant Eurasian continent. A European free trade zone with China,

1:41:01

you'd have to devalue the euro a lot for that trade to come into balance. Ultimately, devaluation is the answer. Tariffs are not the answer. I'm not a capitalist. I don't like capitalists. Capitalists are oligarchs. They're as much of a danger to a free market and a free society as unions on the other side.

1:41:22

I hate Nazis and I hate communists. I hate oligarchs and I hate unions. Like that's where I am. But, you know, a Eurasian free trade zone between the civilized powers, i.e. Europe and China, and the natural resource colonies, the peripheral oil and gas and raw materials producers,

1:41:52

will do their thing and you have to trade with them and you have to defend against them. Because they are revisionist powers, you know, longing for the days when they were industrially relevant. But the fact is that... And that's Russia and the U.S. essentially at this point. Yeah, that's why they have a commonality of interest.

1:42:09

But if you take Southeast Asia, China and Europe, you know, that gets you to about 3 billion people. When I first arrived in the States, my feeling was always like, okay, some super smart people. And I was in love with Silicon Valley. I was in love with the West Coast, especially kind of like the Steve Jobs,

1:42:27

you know, envisaging the future, like the truly passionate people, not the money people, but the creators and the builders. Like, I love that. But the thing that America always had was it had the most dynamic and curious consumers, and it had a lot of them.

1:42:42

And so it was the market in which you could establish critical mass first. Now, a market of 3 billion people with an intense supply chain that nobody else can match, that will be the dominant economic force on the planet. From London... through Istanbul, to Urum Kizyan, down to Kuming and Singapore.

1:43:17

The whole of Eurasia will be... That's the true Silk Road dream. The whole of Eurasia, the world continent, as one economic zone, taking humanity to the next level. beyond the planet. And that will all happen. And it may happen sooner than we think. With the AI,

1:43:47

when the AI has accelerated since January 20th and the deep seek drop, everything's accelerated.

1:43:54

We didn't even begin to talk about that. We can't now because we've run out of time, but I am super grateful. Thank you for coming on, for challenging us, and for making all of us a little bit more sober about the bigger picture that America faces, that the West faces. I'm just grateful. It's a very fresh perspective,

1:44:14

and I think a lot of people are going to have to digest parts of it and I'm no doubt would also want to just have a debate about it. And so I hope we'll make sure you will have people write in and I'll send it to you. And I'd love to be.

1:44:28

I'd love to be part of that. I would love to include you. You can be part of that page. You can respond to their criticisms and their arguments. Do you ever put some of that stuff up on Twitter? X? I'm off X.

1:44:39

I don't do X. All the good people are off X. I just went back on, because there's traders and AI people on there.

1:44:46

I have a burner account that I watch everything by, but I don't participate. I just can't bear any of the other ones, you know? I can't either. Well, you know, Substack is getting better. For discussion. It's beginning. It's sort of taking off. You know, it's five million users now, which is a big jump.

1:45:04

And if you look at the notes section, I've been contributing more and more to it the last few days just because of this Khalil case. I should do that. I should try. Try that because it reminds me of the old blogosphere. Yeah. They're not crazies. They're actually engaging in actual arguments and they're open to counter arguments.

1:45:23

But we also do it on, as you know, every week on the dish itself. So, and we edit and curate. So we would send you edited and curated critiques and you can respond to all of them. We will happily do that. We'd love to do that.

1:45:35

Can you just do two things for me? Yeah. Yeah. Handle on Twitter on X is nicknotned. That's my old handle. Okay. And email address is nick.denton at gmail.com. And any, especially AI... using ideas people out there and traders i would like to hear from any good ideas

1:45:58

you think that you think i got wrong thing that i i've didn't mention that you thought i should have mentioned i i would like to i'd like to hear from people from

1:46:08

from your audience that's that's the dishness of it all that's what we want that's what we love and And if you happen to agree with him about that terrible televised version of Asimov, he would be particularly happy to hear from you.

1:46:23

I felt so alone. You're never alone, Al. I felt so alone. I felt like, oh my God. I mean, I guess it was probably the point at which I... We didn't even talk about it. I kind of broke with American culture. I kind of realized all the shows I watch are Korean.

1:46:40

I find the American stuff almost unwatchable at this point. It's just like an aesthetic. It's an aesthetic thing. It's an aesthetic revulsion.

1:46:50

Coming up, Francis Collins, Douglas Murray, Evan Wolfson, Nick from Budapest. Lots of love and thank you so much. And we'll be in touch. See you later. Cheers. And you all have a lovely, blessed, and hopefully increasingly warm and pleasant weekend. See you next week.

From a fan of [last week’s pod](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/mike-white-on-transcending-identity) with Mike White:

> Brilliant interview. I can’t believe he writes and directs the whole thing himself (he’s the real star of _The White Lotus_), and his characters are so authentic and well-drawn. Fascinating to learn more about him.

Another fan:

> Great podcast, great interview. There’s something disarming about Mike’s almost stream-of-consciousness manner of speaking. _The White Lotus_ is brilliant, and I’m glad you also loved _Enlightened_ — an absolute gem.

And another:

> I don’t listen to the Dishcast every week — Lenten obligations! — but my husband and I have been displaced by the Eaton Fire and are now living in a new area (but close to the grandchildren, which is a blessing). I had been sick for a week and got out of the house for the first time in five days and listened to you and Mike White. It was the best medicine ever. I love _The White Lotus_, as do my adult children, and we have wonderful conversations about it.
> 
> I just fell in love with Mike. It was just such a joyful conversation. I loved his talking about how you inspired him. It rang true. Just thank you again. I was trying to “fast” from politics and news, but when I read the description of that episode, I thought even Jesus would say, “OK, you need to listen.”

The fan mail keeps coming:

> The episode was indeed “a blast.” I’ve been a fan of White’s for a long time but hadn’t ever heard him interviewed before. What a topic list: his dad (a hero of mine), reality TV (he changed my mind a bit), _White Lotus_ (without giving decent credit to Patrick Schwarzenegger’s damn wonderful performance!), Camille Paglia, growing weary with Judith Butler … what a delight.
> 
> And while I can imagine some people might have had a hard time following him and his peripatetic thinking process, but I was well prepared, having seen Lily Tomlin in one of her finest early characters:
> 
> This is an episode for the vaults! Thank you!

Here’s a guest rec:

> Very good to see you [tackling](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/why-did-this-man-mislead-us-cba) the subject of lab leak and doing it so well. A conversation that might enliven the Dishcast would be one with Richard Ebright of Rutgers, who’s been on the side of the angels in this debate from the get-go. At last he’s now being vindicated ,as even the NYT (!) [now admits it was had](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/covid-pandemic-lab-leak.html). Given that there is some evidence to suggest that the same WIV and “[Batwoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi_Zhengli)” are now conducting similar experiments with even more lethal viruses (MERSS, for one), the outbreak of the next pandemic may only be a matter of time.
> 
> By the way, I enjoyed the [Spinoza episode](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/ian-buruma-on-spinoza-and-free-thought) so much I bought [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Spinoza-Freedoms-Messiah-Jewish-Lives/dp/030024892X).

Thanks for the rec, but Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee will be on the podcast soon to discuss their book, _[In Covid’s Wake](https://www.amazon.com/Covids-Wake-How-Politics-Failed/dp/0691267138)_. Another writes:

> Longtime reader and listener here. I wanted to thank you for mentioning our campaign to enact ranked choice voting here in DC during your most recent appearance on Bill Maher’s show:
> 
> As you likely know, over 73% of DC voters approved Initiative 83 this past November. This was a real District-wide win; the initiative won a supermajority in all eight wards and a majority of all 144 precincts in the city (unheard of for a District-wide initiative).
> 
> April marks a real ramp-up of budget negotiations with the DC Council and the mayor’s office to advocate for full funding and implementation of Initiative 83. The mayor and the chair of the Council were and are publicly against Initiative 83 — and we are working to lobby them and the rest of the Council to respect the will of the voters and support funding for education, voter registration, and Board of Election implementation.

Good luck. Let’s hope our colonial overlords in the Congress don’t intervene.

Next up, a bunch of readers continue to debate the [lab leak theory](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/why-did-this-man-mislead-us-cba). First is “some dude who worked in a biochemistry lab for over a decade and now does philosophy”:

> I saw you on Real Time last night and I appreciated your [passion](https://x.com/BlueATLGeorgia/status/1903288845128319421) when speaking of preserving the rule of law in this country and concerns you expressed for the people that have been left behind by this economy. I also agree that it is vitally important for the average American to be able to trusts experts, especially scientists. And though I would argue the general lack of trust is due more to the anti-intellectualism, lack of curiosity, and deficient understanding of many Americans, the scientific community should stand up for the best evidence even when it is inconvenient and avoid politically motivated communications. I also believe that should go for journalists.
> 
> As such, I did have a bit of an issue with the certainty you seemed to project regarding how the first strain of SarsCov2 found its way into the human population.
> 
> Though the explanation has yet to reach a consensus, there are many significant reasons, based in the science of molecular biology, to be dismissive of the lab leak theory. Most notably: the presence of a furin cleavage site in early isolates of the virus; the similar protein sub-structures between COVID-19 and covid viruses in the area; the lack of evidence for recombinant DNA techniques; the complex role that the cleavage site loop length plays in the virulence in conjunction with the furin cleavage site; and the evolutionary distance between the most closely related bat coronaviruses being studied in the Wuhan lab and the earliest isolates. (A good summary of this evidence is provided [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10117112/).)
> 
> If you could not immediately explain the biochemical basis of the statements I just made to another person, maybe you should pull back a little when making claims about the origins of the pandemic to a wider audience. Just citing two emails from British intelligence officers does not justify the level of doubt you cast on career scientists who work for the government.
> 
> The lack of transparency from Chinese officials is a concern. I would even remain skeptical of the Chinese scientist who [presented evidence](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03982-2) against the lab leak by providing the sequences of all the viruses in their lab, but being skeptical requires skepticism of your own biases as well. If scientists working for the government modulated their expert opinions for the sake of politics, that is also a huge concern, but we have to rely on evidence. When it comes to viruses, analysis of the genetic sequences and macromolecular similarities are the most reliable — not anecdotal evidence of the coincidence of some lab techs from the Wuhan lab falling ill around the same time.

My goal is to flush out the truth. I’m afraid the scientists who tell us we are not qualified to judge, as you just did, are not as on-the-level as I’d hoped. My column laid out the reasons why in a way an impromptu answer on a TV show doesn’t. A forthcoming pod with Francis Collins goes into all this in depth and I’m sure you’ll be interested in what he has to say. He too is adamant that there is no evidence for a lab leak. I push him and hear him out. I’m also going to talk to two Princeton professors whose new book, _In Covid’s Wake_, is pretty devastating to Fauci and Collins. We’re going to air all sides as we aways do. And I will have some reactions along the way that are, well, human. That’s me. I’m red-blooded and occasionally get mad when I sense someone I trusted has pulled the wool over my eyes.

Another Chinese scientist is highlighted by this reader:

> Why were we misled?
> 
> I wasn’t. In 2020, Fox News had on a Chinese virologist, Li-Meng Yan, who said there was no way COVID 19 was evolutionarily possible.
> 
> The furin cleavage site was made to target humans and there were no evolutionary steps from known COVID viruses that could act as an intermediary. The caves in China where the bats live that are the origin of COVID viruses are a thousand miles from Wuhan. A thousand miles and no other animal or human was infected along the way? China had killed and frozen all animals at the wet market and guess what? Not a single one had the virus.
> 
> One of the many, many problems of the left is that they think they are smarter than anyone who disagrees with them. Such hubris still infects them. The day after the Fox interview, the machine came out in full force. With marching orders in hand and locked arms, Li-Meng Yan was to be discredited by any means.

From a dissenter:

> I am really disappointed by your column on the lab leak. As a scientist and a civil servant (not in the USA), I get frustrated how people with no experience of these institutions criticize them. It isn’t that there aren’t valid criticisms to be had; it’s that there is a degree of ignorance such that the criticisms tend to dramatically miss the mark. In the lab leak case, it has been done again where research grants are seen as a bias that makes them want to defend the interests of Fauci.
> 
> I won’t say that something like this never happens, but it’s not how things are. For example, as an academic at a university I’ve done research funded by fossil fuel companies on biological impacts. It was neither an attack nor vindication of them, but research looking at effects. They don’t reach out to you demanding results. Persons like Kristian Andersen get many grants to fund their research, and no it doesn’t line their bank accounts. Tenured researchers get no pecuniary benefit from grants.
> 
> So why did Andersen switch from being suspicious about lab leak to suddenly not accepting it as plausible? Listen to Keynes: “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” Andersen (and scientists generally) do not claim that lab leaks shouldn’t have been explored, not at all. Rather, the scientific exploration of these issues has been politicised by Republicans with grievances of Fauci and public institutions, and pathetic left-of-center media organisations did their usual shitty job of conveying scientific probabilities as certainties, particularly to protect a “minority”.
> 
> And I must say, the description of Fauci’s actions that you find so damning sound more like a civil servant working in _Yes, Minister_. That isn’t a vindication of him either, just that when one is painted as malign, it is easy to search through emails and Slack out of context to demonstrate someone’s malicious intentions.
> 
> I recommend listening to [this podcast by two academics](https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/episode/interview-with-worobey-andersen-holmes-the-lab-leak) (not biologists) interviewing the virologists involved in some of this controversy, including two of the authors of the “Proximal Origin” paper: Kristian Andersen and Eddie Holmes. They do a really good job of explaining their professional opinions as scientists based on the information available. They won’t tell you to never believe in lab leak; _au contraire_, they will tell you to look at the evidence:

Here’s the thing. Through FOIA requests, we have many contemporaneous emails from these very scientists from the earliest days saying that they think this is obviously a lab leak. Fauci and Collins tell us they soon realized they were wrong and reversed themselves. But weirdly, we have no emails from these people echoing that — and you’d think reversing yourself so swiftly would lead to some internal comments. We have emails from those who wrote the “Proximal Origin” paper that prove they knew they were distorting science for political reasons. This is from Andersen at the time he authored the paper:

> I hate when politics is injected into science — but it’s impossible not to, especially given the circumstances.

How would you interpret that?

Another recommendation from a reader:

> You should read [Peter Miller on this topic](https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/the-case-against-the-lab-leak-theory-f640ae1c3704), “The case against the lab leak theory.” The facts on the ground haven’t changed in spite of recent claims about probability from the Germans and the CIA. There is no coherent narrative for the lab leak, the various theories contradict each other, and the evidence we do have favors zoonosis. If nothing else, Miller is worth looking at to see how he models the world and tackles arguments. His intellect is relentless.

Further reading from another:

> I had been leaning toward the lab origin for a while, after [Nicholas Wade’s 2021 piece](https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/) pointed out all the findings that seemed to fit with it. However, I read a more in-depth debate [posted by Scott Alexander](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/practically-a-book-review-rootclaim?utm_source=publication-search) that has me now thinking that the natural origin story is probably true (low confidence — about 70-80%). It’s a long but very interesting debate, including which stalls at the market had viral residue, whether furin cleavage sites can arise naturally, and other minutiae. It illustrates that this is an unresolved question.
> 
> Nevertheless, I agree with you that Fauci was trying to cover up that his recklessness may have contributed to killing millions. It’s a very natural impulse to want to avoid blame, but it’s disappointing that he lacked the integrity to accept responsibility for the bad outcome of a decision that he thought was right at the time. A better man would admit error and lead the push for stopping or at least greatly reducing those kinds of experiments. As it stands, he has greatly tarnished his own legacy and the reputation of science for much of the public.

This next reader looks to the “racism” rhetoric surrounding the lab leak:

> I learned many things from your column about the scientific-political machinations around COVID. The use of racism charges to silence the lab leak theory seem very odd to me, since the “wet market” theory that ultimately prevailed and was promoted seems objectively “more racist” if one were to compare the two. At the time there were plenty of charges, loud ones, about not being allowed to believe the wet markets might be a cause for the same reasons. To me, the distinction between the two is not necessarily between racist vs acceptable explanations, but between blaming ordinary people vs blaming a powerful nation-state.
> 
> Your quote here is most salient:
> 
> > More persuasive to me is the idea that no Western politician wanted to start a massive fight with China when their cooperation was so essential.
> 
> Simple greed and avoidance of personal liability were the engines driving this narrative, as they always are. The wet market theory is the perfect scapegoat because it randomizes, anonymizes, and socializes the blame, ensuring no lab, agency, or government would need to be bothered to alter their course in the wake of such a disaster.
> 
> Trust, indeed, needs to be restored. I have no idea how to do it.

Another also quotes me:

> > More persuasive to me is the idea that no Western politician wanted to start a massive fight with China when their cooperation was so essential. The lab leak theory terrified them — because it could mean serious conflict. And so they downplayed it. Appeasement of China is the subtext of all of it.
> 
> In those early days of Covid, Australia’s then government called for an inquiry into Covid’s origins. That [did not go down well](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-03/heres-what-happened-between-china-and-australia-in-2020/13019242) with the Chinese buyers of our iron ore, wine, lobsters, and plenty more besides. Besides that trade war, China called Australia’s leaders racist and arrested Australian citizens in China and more — all to intimidate our government into kowtowing to them.
> 
> It took a change of government in Australia and yes, some quiet appeasement, for China to slowly relax its trade barriers. However, it is very hard to point to any gains for China out of the whole imbroglio. As is the way of commerce, many of the Aussie businesses impacted found new markets. That is not to minimise the pain of transition, but rather to highlight that major powers may not always be as powerful as they think.

Another notes:

> There was a lab leak in a [stateside WMD lab](https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/health/fort-detrick-lab-shut-down-after-failed-safety-inspection-all-research-halted-indefinitely/article_767f3459-59c2-510f-9067-bb215db4396d.html) in the summer 2019 that deserves a mention on the Dish: “All research at a Fort Detrick laboratory that handles high-level disease-causing material, such as Ebola, is on hold indefinitely after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the organization failed to meet biosafety standards.”

One more reader on lab leak:

> One thing that people don’t seem to realize is that compared with the natural emergence theory, the lab leak theory, if true, is overwhelmingly good news. Why? Because we can actually do something to prevent lab leaks — basically upping the biohazard ratings of labs conducting GoF research. By contrast, naturally emerging pathogens can’t be similarly controlled. So it’s deeply ironic that people are moving to cover up relatively good news in favour of really bad news.

On another topic, a reader dissents:

> This line really got my hackles up, in your response to a reader [last week](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/mike-white-on-transcending-identity): “The only way to cut the debt is to tackle Medicare and Social Security.”
> 
> Perhaps you don’t realize the sleight of hand within this “truth”. Yes, this is the biggest part of the budget, but ask yourself why? The massive amount of fraud, waste and abuse by the _for-profit_ health care industry with no government oversight and the hand of Big Pharma pricing drugs out into the stratosphere is why Medicare is so damn expensive. To simply say Medicare should be the target without really getting to the bottom of why these programs need to spend so much money is lazy. Don’t be a tool to these industries that have no oversight, are hugely bloated, and do whatever the fuck they want!
> 
> Also, people have paid into Social Security for many, many years and deserve that program when they retire, and the way it’s funded absolutely should be revisited.

Another on entitlements:

> I must strongly disagree with your statement that the only way to cut the deficit is to tackle Medicare and Social Security. The way to cut the deficit is to raise tax rates on the wealthy, so that they pay a fairer share of the cost of the government that allows the accumulation of their wealth. Tax rates on high-income people have been much higher in the past.
> 
> In addition, adequate funding of the IRS to allow proper review and audit of complex tax returns of wealthy individuals and large corporations would yield a VERY disproportionate return on such an investment. At the moment, the IRS has next-to-no staff or computer power to even begin to look for the large tax payments that go missing every year. Instead, audits are often done on returns of those claiming the earned income tax credit — just peanuts in return to the government, but extremely costly to those being audited.
> 
> Thanks as always for your column and for sharing the comments of other readers.

One more email for the week:

> Your reader [wrote](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/mike-white-on-transcending-identity):
> 
> > I felt like issues surrounding “wokeness” prevented you, Andrew, from seeing the forest for the trees when it came to the much more important issues of respect for our democracy and democratic institutions, the separation of powers, etc.
> 
> On the one hand, I think it’s clear that this reader speaks out of genuine and heartfelt concern for our country; but on the other hand, I find it increasingly amazing that people are still talking like that. Anyone who really does value our “democratic institutions” must oppose both the extremism of Trump as well as the extremism of wokeness (or whatever you want to call it). Trump is, after all, just one manifestation of the illiberalism which constitutes the challenge of our times. And recognizing the danger posed by Trump while minimizing the threat of wokeness is like saying that we need only concern ourselves with only one section of a raging fire.
> 
> Every media outlet (including the NYT, WaPo, NPR) that published a DEI page or a diversity statement of some kind deeply discredited our free press — a vital democratic institution. Instead of analyzing the antiracist ideology, they proselytized it. And by doing so, they betrayed the public trust by wantonly abandoning any pretense of objectivity.
> 
> Every college and university system that demanded diversity statements from prospective faculty signaled for all the world to see that they were more interested in promoting their preferred ideology than in any unbiased pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. No one, not even Trump, has even come close to damaging these institutions as much as they have damaged themselves. With the unshakeable faith of fundamentalists, they have recklessly aligned themselves against all who dissent from their leftist catechism. And the toll that their epic self-destruction has inflicted on what will hopefully remain our open society may take generations to fully understand.
> 
> As you indicated in your own response to the quoted comment, we’re dealing with a fire that keeps feeding on itself. Trump and Musk are busy radicalizing more resistance just as fast as a radicalized left mints new woke crusaders. The only way out that I can see is to promote, and vote for, as much of a moderate alternative (Democrat or Republican) as we can find.

Amen, my brother.

Thanks as always for the great emails, especially the dissents, and you can send yours to **dish@andrewsullivan.com**.

You can also sound off in Substack Notes. This week, I [commented](https://substack.com/@sullydish/note/c-103612570?) on the following clip of NPR’s Katherine Maher getting grilled with her own radical tweets and statements:

> This is an extremely rare example of a member of the media establishment actually being forced to be accountable for the critical race theory racism they foisted on all of us for years by coercion, gaslighting, indoctrination and bullying. Maher is recanting. But she still running NPR. A proud, anti-Western racist running a publicly funded institution.

I covered this anti-Western racist more extensively in my April 2024 column, “[Katherine Maher Is Not A Liberal](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/katherine-maher-is-not-a-liberal-1ea).” I added in Notes this week:

> Defund NPR before USAID please. The former really is a non-stop propaganda machine which has every right to exist, and flourish. But why I should pay a cent for it is beyond me.

To which a reader responded:

> I’m no fan of NPR, nor do I believe it should receive public funding. However, conservatives’ obsessive focus on NPR is misplaced. Even if all public funding for NPR were eliminated, it wouldn’t make the slightest dent in the federal budget or national debt. It’s not even a rounding error. The real focus should be on major expenditures like the military and entitlements. Once those are addressed, we can turn our attention to small potatoes like NPR.
> 
> The fact that this administration is more focused on gutting funding for culture war issues rather than tackling the real drivers of our debt, underscores just how unserious it is about fiscal responsibility.
