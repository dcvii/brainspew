When Vice President J.D. Vance and his wife, Second Lady Usha Vance, went to The Kennedy Center, in Washington, D.C., on March 13 they were hoping, like all parents of three young children, to have a night out. They didn’t expect to get heckled.

“I don’t think we anticipated that anyone would really notice,” Usha told me.

As the Vances were led by the Secret Service to their balcony seats, a smattering of boos coalesced into a midsize chorus. Someone said, “J.D. Vance,” and someone else said, “Oh, fuck him.” And then someone else yelled, “Kill that light!”—apparently hoping that, at the very least, they might be spared the sight of the vice president.

“It was about 20 or 30 seconds of some people booing and delaying the start of the concert, right as the conductor is about to come out, and there were a few other people clapping. J.D. waved at them, and then we enjoyed the show that we had come for,” Usha said.

From their perch, it didn’t seem like the kind of thing [someone would record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZUbamlSCnw) and post to X, where reporters were always sniffing around in search of a story—transforming a date night into a headline.

Usha seemed perplexed by the whole episode: “It’s a really good example,” she said, “of reporting in search of a narrative that tends to occur.”

And then: “We just go to concerts, right?”

Not quite.

The idea—that we don’t heckle or otherwise confront people we disagree with politically in public—at one time seemed like a perfectly reasonable assumption. In the before times, it was not unusual to see [Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://www.kennedy-center.org/wno/home/about/rbg/) and Antonin Scalia together in that same concert hall listening to the Washington National Opera.

But in the first 100 days of the second Trump term—weeks after President Donald Trump had gutted The Kennedy Center—the idea that “we just go to concerts” sounded a little quaint, especially coming from the wife of the sitting vice president. The idea that any member of the administration could listen to Shostakovich and Stravinsky without incident feels very far away.

Usha and I were sitting in the library of the vice president’s residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory, which rests atop a grassy hill and is surrounded by a brick wall and a black, wrought-iron fence. The library is painted hunter green, and has creaky, hardwood floors, and the shelves are lined with vice-presidential-themed books that no one will ever read—[by Al Gore](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780670062720), about Mike Pence, and so forth.

It was March 18—about three weeks after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky had his disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the Oval Office, and three weeks before “Liberation Day,” when the Trump tariffs tanked global markets. One of the Second Lady’s aides lit a fire in the fireplace behind us. We sipped tap water in glasses with the seal of the vice president on them, the same seal that was imprinted in thick green lettering on the disposable towelettes in the men’s room.

The Second Lady wore an ivory silk tie-neck blouse and dark, wide-leg pants—the photographer had wanted a top with more color, but she was going to wear what she was going to wear—and she looked the way one would expect: put together, perfectly coifed, if not entirely at ease. She was on message.

It was the first and, so far, only interview she had granted since her husband was elected vice president of the United States.

Normally, the spouse of the most visible, least important person in a White House administration is supposed to poll well and be invisible. (Doug Emhoff [taught a class](https://people.com/politics/doug-emhoff-on-what-hes-learned-in-new-teaching-role/) at Georgetown University. Jill Biden, as Second Lady, [oversaw an initiative](https://web.archive.org/web/20101230103607/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iGr8abuzwYYWi91x-7O68TzBVXjQ) about the importance of community colleges.)

But J.D. Vance is not the least important person in the new Trump administration—not by a very long shot.

And ever since Usha made her debut at the Republican convention in July, in that cobalt-blue [Badgley Mischka dress](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/jd-vance-wife-usha-vance-dress-rnc-1236497598/) wearing nearly no jewelry or makeup, the public has been more than a little fascinated by her.

The fashion venue *[WWD](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/jd-vance-wife-usha-vance-dress-rnc-1236497598/)* [noted](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/jd-vance-wife-usha-vance-dress-rnc-1236497598/), with a thinly veiled mix of admiration and disdain, that she had not consulted with the designers about the $495 garment. A Badgley Mischka spokesperson told the outlet that “she must have purchased the frock on her own at retail.” (Others have been able to look beyond the partisanship: “True or false,” Jack Schlossberg, John F. Kennedy’s [only grandson tweeted](https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/1881397115051712855), “Usha Vance is way hotter than Jackie O”—his grandmother.)

Back then, in the early summer of 2024, she was still the mostly unknown wife of a United States senator from a flyover state. “The day before J.D. was selected—I did not know he was going to be selected—I was working as a lawyer, and I had the wardrobe of a person with three children who likes to do things outdoors, who has a dog, who doesn’t like things to be too precious,” Usha told me. “And then, a switch flipped, and it’s not like it came with a whole new wardrobe and stylist and everything.”

Now, she’s the Second Lady of the United States, or SLOTUS (without a doubt, the worst acronym in the lexicon of D.C. acronyms). And even though there have been many SLOTUSes before her, there has never really been one like Usha Vance.

“The day before J.D. was selected—I did not know he was going to be selected—I was working as a lawyer, and I had the wardrobe of a person with three children who likes to do things outdoors, who has a dog, who doesn’t like things to be too precious. And then, a switch flipped, and it’s not like it came with a whole new wardrobe and stylist and everything.”

There are the obvious firsts: She’s the first Hindu Second Lady, and the first Indian American Second Lady. But that’s the least of it.  
  
She is, by far, the most impressive person to fill this role. Or at least since the very first Second Lady of the United States: Abigail Adams, who served from 1797 to 1801, when John Adams was President George Washington’s vice president.  
  
She was top of her class at Yale Law School; an editor of the law review; a [clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/usha-vance/); and partner-bound in one of the nation’s most prestigious white-shoe law firms. “People taking bets would have said she could have been solicitor general or attorney general of the United States,” said a close friend from Yale Law.

Who knows? She’s only 39 years old—she may well still do either of those things.

But for now, she is Mrs. J.D. Vance.

There is no how-to manual for being married to the heir apparent of the MAGA movement. For funneling your immense talents and ambitions into what is, by its nature, a supportive role. For being the first nonwhite Second Lady in a movement awash in talk of “[heritage Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/opinion/donald-trump-tech-musk-bannon.html).” For negotiating the gulf between the man you married with the extremist or even “[neofascist](https://www.yahoo.com/news/jd-vance-neofascist-reading-list-235548677.html)” he’s been made out to be. For helping him become the 48th president of the United States. And for raising three normal kids [under the age of 8](https://people.com/all-about-jd-vance-kids-8678153)—even as Democrats call you “[weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvwHcAEqLGc),” and you and your husband now have code names.

There is, about the world she inhabits, an unprecedented surreality.

“Obviously,” she told me, “our lives are not normal, and it feels almost absurd to say that they are.”

#### **A ‘Partnership’ Forged at Yale Law**

By now, everyone in America knows her husband’s story: Appalachia, the Marines, Iraq, Yale. The Never Trumper turned MAGA successor.

It was the perfect distillation of 21st-century America: the opioid crisis, the post-industrialization crisis, the crisis of the working class and “[deaths of despair](https://bookshop.org/p/books/deaths-of-despair-and-the-future-of-capitalism-angus-deaton/16039441?ean=9780691217079&next=t),” the betrayal of the elites. Vance turned it all into a best-selling memoir, *Hillbilly Elegy*, which made him a darling among progressives and then the Silicon Valley counter-elite whose support helped catapult him to [the Senate in 2022](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/ohio-senate-midterm-2022-jd-vance-wins-rcna55175), which led, seemingly ineluctably, to The Call, on July 15, 2024—the first day of the Republican convention.

What was less known was that J.D. Vance had met and fallen in love with Usha Chilukuri—who seemed the polar opposite of everything he was.

She was the older of two daughters of a mechanical engineer and a molecular biologist who had emigrated from India in the 1980s. She had grown up outside San Diego, and graduated summa cum laude from Yale, and then earned a master’s in history at Cambridge, and then, in the fall of 2010, returned to Yale to study law. That’s where she met her future husband.

“Obviously, our lives are not normal, and it feels almost absurd to say that they are.”

She was, as her close friends from Yale Law put it, “poised beyond belief,” “ridiculously intelligent,” “a perfect human.” (I spoke with several of Usha’s and J.D.’s Yale Law friends. They were effusive about both of them, but almost none felt free to speak openly because they work at the Department of Justice or law firms with a strict, no-talking-to-the-press policy.)

“Everyone’s always projecting stuff on Usha when they have no clue,” a former professor said. “She’s one of the hardest people to understand because she combines qualities that you don’t usually find in one person. She’s incredibly strong—she can be formidable—especially when it comes to protecting her family. But she’s also one of the kindest, most empathetic, most softhearted people I know.”

Usha is a tad foggy about when and where, exactly, their “crazy adventure” began. Not her husband: “J.D. is quite certain where we met,” she told me.

![Meet Usha Vance: MAGA’s Enigmatic Second Lady in The Free Press](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd725ed1-d0cb-41a7-96bd-fb6b3698dd15_6200x8272.jpeg)

“It was very helpful and also exciting, right? I was learning more about him every day,” said Usha on reading J.D.’s first draft of *Hillbilly Elegy* at Yale Law.

It was the fall of 2010, and he had graduated from Ohio State the year before, and she had just returned to the United States from Cambridge, England. They were in the same “small group”—the group of 15 or so students with whom they would spend a lot of time over the next three years—and they were in the law library at Yale, in the stacks, surrounded by stained glass and gothic spires, and they were on a tour, which she found captivating and he, apparently, could not have cared less about.

“He says that he was trying to talk to me while I was on this tour,” Usha said, “but I recall paying attention to the tour and trying to take in all this information about the library and the carrels and all these sorts of things.”

“Sometime in that first week, we started to become friends, because the small group was fairly tight knit and kind of centered your social world when you start at the law school,” she went on.

They started dating in their first year. By their third year, they were living together with a [German shepherd named Casper](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/jd-vance-yale-law-school.html#:~:text=A%20close%20look%20at%20Mr,summer%20working%20on%20Capitol%20Hill.), who makes a brief appearance at the end of *Hillbilly Elegy*.

It was not always easy communicating with her then-boyfriend across class and place, Usha told me.

The story behind *Hillbilly Elegy*, she said, helped fill in a lot of the gaps—J.D. writing, Usha reading, J.D. rewriting, Usha rereading.

“It was like the serial unveiling of—not secrets, it’s not that he had been concealing it from me—but he was sort of telling me this story in real time that he had never really told anyone,” she said. “It was very helpful and also exciting, right? This was the person that I loved, and I was learning more about him every day as he was remembering things that he hadn’t really thought about or certainly hadn’t talked about in a very long time.”

“It’s difficult to accuse Vance of being sympathetic to white nationalists when his wife is Indian American and his children are Indian American,” political scientist Paul Sracic said. “That insulates him from that attack.” (Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images)

Vance was unlike most people at Yale Law, his law school friends said. Most people there had known forever that they wanted to go there, and they knew exactly where they were going. But Vance seemed conflicted. He would later recall, in an essay for the [Catholic literary journal](https://thelampmagazine.com/blog/how-i-joined-the-resistance) *[The Lamp](https://thelampmagazine.com/blog/how-i-joined-the-resistance)*, that seeing the venture capitalist Peter Thiel speak in 2011 was “the most significant moment of my time” at Yale. “He articulated a feeling that had until then remained unformed,” Vance wrote of Thiel, “that I was obsessed with achievement” per se—“not as an end to something meaningful, but to win a social competition.” It was the beginning of a spiritual—and, ultimately, political—wandering.

“Partnership” and “team” were the words their law school friends used to describe them to me. They also mentioned “empathy” and “adaptability.”

James Eimers, a close friend from law school, called J.D. “kind” and “unassuming,” and he called Usha “selfless,” and he talked about her “superhuman capacity to achieve.” Eimers recalled J.D. shepherding his mother around New Haven after Eimers underwent surgery, and the two of them driving out of their way on a cross-country trip to visit Eimers at his grandmother’s home in Wisconsin.

“In a somewhat ridiculous display of her devotion to a friend, Usha even went so far as to buy a table she didn’t *really* need from a particular student in the class a year ahead of us,” Eimers emailed me. “Usha knew that I had been looking for an unobtrusive scenario in which to ask the table seller on a date and that—with the table purchase—I would be forced to retrieve and transport the table for her because I owned the only pickup truck and served as the unofficial nonprofit moving company of our class.”

He added: “Shortly thereafter, I did indeed pick up Usha’s superfluous table. As well as a date with the table seller.”

Another law school friend who was in J.D. and Usha’s small group recalled the Yale Law cliques: the activists, the affinity group people, the future academics, the future presidents. Everyone had their tribe.

“There’s, like, 200 of us in a class, and you should, on paper, get along with everyone. But then you don’t,” she said.

“We had many different circles in our law school class, and we literally had this group that would gather at this bar called Rudy’s every Tuesday, and they literally thought they were a quote-unquote exclusive group,” she added. These were the future presidents, or, at least, the people who imagined themselves future presidents. J.D. wasn’t part of that group. “I don’t even know where half that group is now.”

J.D.’s group, meanwhile, was basically him and James Eimers and Usha and a handful of other people. “They’d go into James’s truck, and they would always volunteer to dig out people’s cars from under the snow.”

“I don’t think J.D., in his wildest dreams, thought he would be where he is today,” she said. Usha, she added, “could have belonged to any group. But I think it says a lot about her that she didn’t want that.” Then, she said: “I think that’s paid off.”

#### **Outsiders Together**

Both J.D. Vance and Usha Chilukuri were beneficiaries of a meritocracy that they had ascended in very different ways—J.D., by force of will, soldiering on against the odds; Usha, by carefully climbing the ladder, one rung at a time.

But if J.D. was, by nature, the outsider at Yale Law—in his book, he recalls not knowing what chardonnay is—Usha’s choice to spend her life with him was a choice to be an outsider, too, to immerse herself in a new world thousands of miles from southern California, her parents, her home.

“When I proposed to my wife, we were in law school,” [Vance said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzyQYSSuOpk) toward the end of his convention speech in July of last year, “and I said, ‘Honey, I come with $120,000 worth of law school debt and a cemetery plot on a mountainside in eastern Kentucky’ ”—near “my family’s ancestral home.”

That ancestral home included J.D.’s mother, Beverly Aikins.

Beverly had been [an alcoholic](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/elections/jd-vance-mother-beverly-aikins-relationship.html) and hooked on painkillers like Vicodin and Percocet. She had snorted heroin and had worked her way through a series of men and addresses. It was so bad that she had been unable to raise her own son. That was left to Beverly’s mother, J.D.’s grandmother, whom J.D. famously called Mamaw.

“I first met her before she had reached some of the worst periods of her addiction,” Usha said of Beverly, whom she met during law school. “It was just hard to know who she really was, because we only saw her mediated through something else, something that made her snappish, more exhausted, less able to be the person that she actually, really is.”

You could imagine J.D. wanting to leave home and never come back. You could imagine Usha wanting the same. But in 2013, they graduated from law school and moved to northern Kentucky, about 45 minutes from Middletown, Ohio, where he had grown up.

At the time, Usha was clerking for then-District Court Judge Amul Thapar; he was clerking for a judge across the hall.

“She loved the people, and they loved her,” Thapar told me. He meant the janitors, the secretaries. “She was always thoughtful, always smiling. She got along with everyone—these are J.D.’s people.” (Thapar added that she was a “brilliant law clerk.”)

The next year, 2014, Usha and J.D. married. Thapar, [who has been floated](https://web.archive.org/web/20161008031216/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-adds-to-list-of-potential-supreme-court-justice-picks) as a possible Supreme Court justice since Antonin Scalia died in 2016, officiated the wedding.

The wedding was at a forested resort in a little town outside Lexington, and it included a Hindu ceremony, with both J.D. and Usha wearing traditional garb. To the outsider—especially looking back—it may have appeared like the high-water mark of America’s multicultural moment: Barack Obama was president, and a poor boy from Appalachia was marrying the daughter of striving Indian immigrants. It was the apex of our post-racial politics.

But it was more straightforward than that, less political, less symbolic: It was just two people, in love, who had decided to spend the rest of their lives together.

That same year, Usha started clerking for Brett Kavanaugh, who was then a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

They were now firmly ensconced in polite society—the young highly credentialed [power couple who dined](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/jd-vance-trump-republican-frumforum/629814/) at the homes of prominent Washington, D.C., journalists, who would [attend the Aspen Ideas Festival](https://www.aspendailynews.com/news/when-jd-vance-came-to-aspen/article_93ab2824-52fe-11ef-ba2b-cfd04bc437bf.html) and [write opinion pieces](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/opinion/barack-obama-and-me.html) for *The New York Times*.

Nothing solidified that positioning more than the publication of *Hillbilly Elegy*. It was June 2016 when the book came out—just a few months before Donald Trump would be elected to the White House for the first time. The timing was perfect.

The Vances were, by then, living in San Francisco—he was at [Mithril Capital](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/15/jd-vance-55-things-trump-vp-00167882), a venture capital fund co-founded by Peter Thiel; she was at the progressive, high-powered law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson.

“Do I think it’s great when people talk about ‘normalizing Indian hate’ or something like that? Absolutely not. I think it’s terrible.”

It was the pinnacle of coastal elitism, and it was the start of the weird in-between—when J.D. Vance became the heartland whisperer and the two of them floated uncertainly between MAGA and MAGA’s progressive haters. He was [a celebrity now](https://variety.com/2024/film/columns/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-donald-trump-vp-hollywood-1236073802/), and even though he had always been a conservative, progressives thought of him as progressive-adjacent, someone they could trust.

They loved his book, Vance’s friend, the conservative writer Rod Dreher, [noted at the time](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/why-liberals-love-hillbilly-elegy/), for challenging “right-wing free-market pieties.” And they loved that [Vance had once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlJoFcq_lRU) the new president might be “America’s Hitler.”

After the election, the book became even more important: Ezra Klein, in a February 2017 [interview with Vance](https://www.vox.com/2017/2/2/14404770/jd-vance-trump-hillbilly-elegy-ezra-klein-show), called it an “explanatory toolkit people used for Trump.”

At around the same time, early 2017, the Vances moved back to Ohio. Usha was pregnant with their first son, Ewan.

That was when her relationship with Beverly started to evolve, Usha said. Beverly had made it through a year and a half of sobriety, but she was still smoking, which Usha’s obstetrician didn’t like.

When they told Beverly this, Usha was surprised by her response. “She just quit smoking immediately. She just dropped it, a habit that she had for such a long time, and I remember just being incredibly impressed by that.”

She added: “Then we had our baby”—in June 2017—“and she just kind of came alive.” Beverly, she said, was “always coming by” to see her grandson.

A year later, when [Trump nominated](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/09/624727227/trump-to-name-his-second-supreme-court-pick) Brett Kavanaugh to fill Anthony Kennedy’s Supreme Court seat, Usha’s former boss seemed like a shoo-in. He had impeccable credentials—including a degree from Yale Law—and Republicans controlled the Senate. At the time he was nominated, Usha was clerking for Chief Justice John Roberts—the most prestigious post possible for a young lawyer. It felt like a moment of limitless possibility.

But then a psychology professor named [Christine Blasey Ford accused](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/california-professor-writer-of-confidential-brett-kavanaugh-letter-speaks-out-about-her-allegation-of-sexual-assault/2018/09/16/46982194-b846-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html) Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a high school party nearly four decades earlier. She had never said anything about it until 2012, and she was pretty sure it happened in 1982, and there was no physical evidence tying Kavanaugh to any assault. But it was like a neutron bomb had gone off in Washington—and the fallout, including its impact on the Vances, was hard to overstate.

#### **Joining the New American Right**

Before Blasey Ford came forward, Kavanaugh was one of the most respected judges in the country. “In the aughts, there were exactly two superhot judges that every elite law school student wanted to clerk for, and they were Merrick Garland and Brett Kavanaugh, including every progressive at Yale and Harvard,” a progressive New York lawyer told me. Never mind that no one had ever accused him of anything untoward. Never mind that he had hired countless female law clerks over the years.

All of that was immaterial in the fall of 2018—the height of #MeToo.

Ultimately, Kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed, 50-48, but not before he was subjected to a withering interrogation in front of the whole country—including then-Senator Kamala Harris, laying the groundwork for her 2020 presidential bid, [asking Kavanaugh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNqoweINCEk) whether he would agree to a polygraph. (He said he would do whatever the Judiciary Committee wanted, but noted that polygraphs were [inadmissible in federal court](https://apnews.com/article/937ab9e859ae4c018f6960f451a39460).)

The Vances were “outraged” by the way he was treated, a source close to them said. “Kavanaugh was a huge fan of Usha’s, and they’ve remained close.” A law school friend of both said in an email: “I believe that J.D. and Usha (like many other students and clerks of Judge Kavanaugh) were very upset by his treatment. It was challenging for them to watch a mentor being unjustly attacked.” She added: “I imagine that certainly impacted them.”

![Meet Usha Vance: MAGA’s Enigmatic Second Lady in The Free Press](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3832183-5657-45ad-8eb6-4007642f7b3a_8272x6200.jpeg)

The Vances were “outraged” by the way Brett Kavanaugh was treated at his confirmation hearing, a source close to them said. “Kavanaugh was a huge fan of Usha’s, and they’ve remained close.”

Vance wasn’t saying much, if anything, publicly about running for office, but he was clearly thinking about it. In March 2021, Peter Thiel [pumped $10 million](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/15/politics/hillbilly-elegy-author-vance-pac-donation-senate/index.html) into a super PAC supporting a possible Senate bid in Ohio.

In July 2021, [Vance announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJiCTr9zOaE) that he was entering the GOP Senate primary in Ohio, and the weird in-between—from the summer of 2016 to the summer of 2021, when the couple floated happily, if uneasily, in this vaguely right-of-center, elite, urbane middle ground—officially came to an end.

In his announcement, Vance sounded like a far more knowledgeable, less bumptious, but no less combative, Trump, railing against the American business elite that had sold out the working class, and the Biden administration for its mishandling of the southern border. “You care about immigration—you’re a racist,” he said. “You care about the fact that our trade and manufacturing jobs are going over to China, ‘Well, you’re just an idiot. You don’t appreciate that, yeah, maybe your whole communities are being destroyed by the loss of jobs, but do you know you can get a lot of cheap crap at Walmart in exchange?’ That’s what they believe about us.” Suddenly, the Yalie venture capitalist was part of the much-maligned “us.”

“It’s almost like Republicans have to have a counterrevolutionary mindset,” Vance [told me](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-rise-of-the-republican-class) in late 2021. “While conservatism is a good description of what we want to do, it’s not a good description of how we go about our goals.” One example of this “counterrevolutionary mindset” in action appears to be the tariffs [Trump announced](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-liberation-day-arrives-gambles-big-risky-tariff/story?id=120382209) last Wednesday. “President Trump is taking this economy in a different direction,” the [now-vice president said](https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6370983790112) last week. “This is a big change, I’m not going to shy away from it, but we needed a big change.” He added: “We cannot keep going down the Joe Biden globalist pathway.”

Viewed through the lens of 2025, the MAGA pivot looks remarkably astute—Machiavellian even. But that summer, in the midst of a GOP primary that included much more seasoned candidates than him, even with a lot of Silicon Valley money on his side, it was a risk without an obvious return.

In fact, it wasn’t until April 2022, nearly a year later, when Trump [endorsed him](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/15/1093148912/trump-endorses-j-d-vance-wading-into-ohios-contentious-republican-senate-primary), that he jumped ahead in the polls. Soon after, [Thiel donated](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/jd-vance-win-ohio-primary-00029881) more money to the super PAC, bringing the total to $15 million. On May 3, [Vance won](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/03/1095662187/ohio-republican-senate-primary-results-vance-trump) the Republican Senate primary. That November, he went on to beat Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan and become Ohio’s next junior senator.

“It’s really easy to caricature your enemy, and I think there are plenty of people who do that on the right as well.”

When I asked Usha about this period, she insisted that her “experience,” since J.D. entered politics “has been almost uniformly positive.”

Which sounded like a very lawyerly, politically calibrated way of saying that MAGA Republicans are not cave dwellers. She added: “People have just been quite accepting.”

She thought that there was a Pacific Ocean separating the angry online right—with its ugliness, its nativism, its antisemitism—and the countless Americans out there who craved a more commonsensical politics that transcended race or ethnicity.

On the campaign trail, she said, “People would come up to me, because, maybe, they identified with me in certain respects—they were not members of this online cohort that you’re describing—and they would come and give me hugs.” She recalled being in a shopping mall to return some shoes that didn’t fit one of her kids, and “I remember a woman came up to me, a black woman came up and gave me a giant hug and said, ‘I love you so much.’ ”

She added: “There have been so many examples of this that, I think, the notion that the people who are interested in and support J.D. are really concentrated among a nativist population that is exclusionary and kind of pushing away other groups is belied both my actual experiences”—and, in 2024, “by the election results.” (She appeared to be alluding to the growing number of black and Latino voters who [backed the GOP ticket](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/donald-trump-2024-campaign-coalition.html) in November.)

It wasn’t just her husband who had bid farewell to the world of the “right-thinking” people. She had said goodbye, too: In 2024, Rancho Peñasquitos, Usha Vance’s hometown, where the average house [is valued at](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/117557/rancho-penasquitos-san-diego-ca/) a little north of $1.4 million, [voted](https://www.kpbs.org/news/politics/2025/01/13/san-diegos-democratic-blues-how-voters-slipped-away-from-the-party) 62 percent for Kamala Harris.

Just as Usha had once had to adapt to the new world of Middletown, Ohio, she now had to adapt to the much bigger, more frenetic, high-velocity world of the new American right.

#### **‘A Very Lonely, Lonely World’**

When she took to the podium at the convention in the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, to introduce J.D., Usha Vance looked nervous. There were 18,000 MAGA cheerleaders in the auditorium, and she was on national television, and she was not a natural politician. She did not appear to be enjoying herself. “That J.D. and I could meet at all, let alone fall in love and marry, is a testament to this great country,” [she told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYnS7eFK_DU) the crowd.

The media didn’t know what to make of her. She was obviously “[elegant](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/style/usha-vance-rnc-maga-trump.html)” and “highly [accomplished and sophisticated](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/usha-vance-greenland-mike-waltz-rcna197829),” but she had said almost nothing in public.

She was certainly not the brawler that he was—[dressing down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pxbGjvcdyY) the Ukrainian president in front of the cameras; or [bitch-slapping](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1905269161019818048) the editor in chief of *Jewish Insider* (J.D. called him “the dumbest journalist in Washington”); or [lecturing the Europeans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6OfU-zrIYw) about Europe, or, as he put it, “the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.”

Usha does have a way of softening things, making him less of an attack dog—case in point: last month’s trip to Greenland. As Trump was making noises about taking over the Danish-controlled territory, Vance traveled there with Usha. She sported sunglasses, and the two of them wore matching Army-green parkas, and she somehow made the whole affair seem just a little less threatening.

Now, in the library at the vice president’s residence, her political utility was on vivid display.

Everyone in the J.D.-Usha orbit agreed she was his most trusted adviser. When I asked her about this, she was unsurprisingly vague, saying only that they often talked about things, the news, and politics upstairs, in the residence, or via text, or sometimes in the late morning, between meetings.

“I don’t know that he’s asking me for advice so much as, it can be a very lonely, lonely world not to share with someone,” she said.

More importantly, there is the question of the future.

In 2028, or maybe 2032, J.D. Vance could very well be his party’s presidential nominee. (On Thursday, [he said](https://nypost.com/2025/04/03/us-news/jd-vance-suggests-he-could-run-for-president-in-2028-but-only-after-consulting-with-trump/) of a possible 2028 run, “When we get to that point, I’ll talk to the president. We’ll figure out what we want to do.”) To win, he will need to convince millions of independent voters in the suburbs of Atlanta and Philadelphia and Phoenix and Detroit to vote for him in a general election. He will need to convince them he’s not the blood-and-soil nationalist that they worry (or will be told to worry) he may be.

Usha Vance will help them get over their worries.

“It’s difficult to accuse Vance of being sympathetic to white nationalists when his wife is Indian American and his children are Indian American,” Paul Sracic, a political scientist at Youngstown State University in Ohio, told me. Sracic has been following Vance since his 2021 Senate run. “That insulates him from that attack,” he said, adding: “For all the accusations of Republicans being a throwback party, she’s no 1950s wife. She’s a 2025 wife.”

When I asked Usha what the media, including *The Free Press*, does not understand about her husband, she said: “It’s a very strange life that we lead, where there are lots of people who have just imagined all sorts of narratives about us and what we think and what we do and why we do it and how much planning goes into it and all these sorts of things.”

She smiled while she spoke. She seemed alternately bemused and irritated by the spectacle they had become. “To me, the highest priority right now is to be actually a normal person.”

When I asked her what it was like to be an Indian-American woman in MAGA Land—with all the blondes and Botox and facelifts, the low-cut blouses and nine-inch heels—she laughed.

![Meet Usha Vance: MAGA’s Enigmatic Second Lady in The Free Press](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7dd57a-981b-431e-b708-e665bcb0cf43_6200x8272.jpeg)

“People don’t seem to care all that much what I look like,” Usha said.

“I’m laughing,” Usha said, “because it would be really hard for me to be blonde,” adding “that color would look totally absurd.” She wasn’t into dyeing her hair anyway; she preferred to let it go gray. “For what it’s worth, my reception into this world—and I’m not from a particularly wealthy background, not from a very fashion-oriented background personally or professionally—has been really positive,” she reiterated. “People don’t seem to care all that much what I look like.”

But it was impossible not to think of Usha Vance when, in early February, Elon Musk fired and then rehired—at her [husband’s urging](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1887900880143343633)—a 25-year-old computer engineer who wanted to “normalize Indian hate.”

This triggered a nasty back-and-forth between the vice president and Democratic Rep. [Ro Khanna](https://www.thefp.com/p/ro-khanna-plan-to-win-trump-base-jd-vance-steve-bannon), who, like Usha, is of Indian origin.

When I asked Usha about the exchange, she told me she hadn’t seen “the entirety” of it. I suggested that her husband resented Khanna or anyone else suggesting he wasn’t prioritizing his three kids (Vivek, a son, was born in 2020; Mirabel, their daughter, was born in 2021). She nodded: “There is nothing that he cares more about than how his children grow up and how he relates to them and how we live together as a family. And he is very, very, very concerned, as we both are and I think maybe anyone in our position would be, about how this life impacts them.”

Then, she said: “Do I think it’s great when people talk about ‘normalizing Indian hate’ or something like that? Absolutely not. I think it’s terrible.”

But Usha didn’t think people saying racist things was new. “I think it’s our relationship to this information”—the technology, the screens, the social media—“that is potentially new.”

She was bothered by the technology, the new culture, which seemed to be making us dumber. “We are increasingly incapable of actually focusing on having sustained, nuanced, thoughtful conversations,” Usha said. She thought that one of the ways to counteract that was to read “paper books.” She said she was reading *Brooklyn*, by the Irish novelist Colm Tóibín.

“I don’t know that he’s asking me for advice so much as, it can be a very lonely, lonely world not to share with someone.”—Usha on life with J.D.

She added: “Very, very intelligent people say things that are sometimes very, very ill-founded because we are now in this world in which all conversations happen based on limited information very quickly, without the kind of reflection that might have been possible before.”

This was a polite way of saying that a lot of the people she used to know—in San Francisco, in Washington—had no idea what the [new right](https://www.thefp.com/p/what-does-the-new-right-want) was all about.

“I have been really struck by the earnestness with which a number of people who are unpopular in certain quarters—the earnestness with which they genuinely want to make people’s lives better,” she said. “There are a lot of people who are actually motivated by the precise desires that people on the other side also say they’re motivated by. They just have a very different understanding of how to achieve some of those goals.”

Her voice became a little quieter. “It’s really easy to caricature your enemy,” she said, “and I think there are plenty of people who do that on the right as well.”

She seemed aware of our reverberating politics—how ugly or stupid things that are said on one side led, with an almost Newtonian inevitability, to ugly and stupid things being said on the other.

Usha was hesitant to expose her children to that.

We had just wrapped up the interview, and she was being led around the first floor of the vice president’s residence by the photographer, who was trying to find the right light. When I asked if she wanted her kids to attend Yale, Usha said, “It might be better to go with a smaller school, to counterbalance all of this pomp and circumstance.”
