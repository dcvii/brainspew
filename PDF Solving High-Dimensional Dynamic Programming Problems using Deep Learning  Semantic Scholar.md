This work applies its method to solve two distinct annually calibrated overlapping generations models with high-dimensional state-spaces, aggregate uncertainty, illiquid capital, a one-period bond, occasionally binding constraints, and idiosyncratic risk, demonstrating that deep equilibrium nets can solve rich and economically relevant models accurately.
