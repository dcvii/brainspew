$14.6 billion.  
  
It was the single biggest healthcare fraud bust in Department of Justice history.  
  
Trump’s administration is actually fighting back against the criminals who loot our system and steal your tax dollars.  
  
And you won’t believe who the DOJ says is behind it all—they're not even from the America.  
  
🧵 THREAD

It was a bombshell that came out of left field.  
  
Both Trump and Kennedy had promised to tackle the waste, fraud and abuse in healthcare, today they were delivering on that promise.  
  
This morning, The Justice Department announced the LARGEST healthcare fraud takedown in its history, a sweeping operation that officials say marks a new era in fighting corruption in America’s healthcare system.  
  
At the heart of this unprecedented crackdown is $14.6 billion in alleged fraudulent claims—a staggering figure that pinpoints just how vulnerable taxpayer-funded programs like Medicare and Medicaid have become.  
  
Matthew Galeotti, chief of the DOJ’s criminal division, described the moment as a turning point.  
  
“Thank you all for joining us today as we announce the largest coordinated healthcare fraud takedown in the history of the Department of Justice,” he said, calling it “a decisive moment in our fight to protect American taxpayers from fraudsters and to defend the integrity of America's healthcare system.”  
  
The charges span 324 defendants across the country, accused of orchestrating elaborate schemes to siphon billions in false claims.  
  
Galeotti laid out the sheer scope of the operation:  
  
“We are announcing, today, charges against 324 defendants for their alleged participation in healthcare fraud schemes, involving approximately $14.6 billion in false claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare programs.” <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775196551901184/pl/Toye_He2QL58TKub.m3u8?v=1da&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775196551901184/vid/avc1/1280x720/J7hkDStIqsTqvVVz.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775196551901184/vid/avc1/1920x1080/p484SDSu-OddYT4B.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775196551901184/vid/avc1/480x270/SNX3Orle9vMyIyG6.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775196551901184/vid/avc1/640x360/fO1866O0qYE1HAVV.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

This is where it gets even wilder.  
  
The DOJ says these aren’t just small-time scams and the perpetrators are not even American.  
  
They've been tracking transnational criminal organizations exploiting the American healthcare system on a massive scale.  
  
Russian and Pakistani fraudsters were among those accused of literally siphoning money from American taxpayers. Galeotti laid out the alarming details.  
  
“We are seeing a disturbing trend of transnational criminal organizations engaging in increasingly sophisticated and complex criminal schemes that defraud the American healthcare system.”  
  
“As part of this takedown, we've identified and charged defendants operating from Russia, Eastern Europe, Pakistan, and other foreign countries.”  
  
“These individuals have infiltrated our healthcare system to steal American taxpayer dollars.”  
  
One scheme was particularly audacious.  
  
“We dismantled a scheme involving a sophisticated operation run from Russia and Eastern Europe that strategically bought dozens of medical supply companies in the United States and submitted more than $10 billion in fraudulent healthcare claims to Medicare.”  
  
It was more than just money lost, it was personal.  
  
Galeotti revealed the chilling human cost.  
  
“To make matters worse, these perpetrators used the stolen identities of more than 1 million Americans, spanning all 50 states, to perpetrate this scheme and submit these false claims.”  
  
He closed with some relief for taxpayers.  
  
“But I'm pleased to report that federal agents intercepted and arrested key members of that organization at U.S. airports and the US-Mexico border, cutting off their intended escape routes.” <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775963300003841/pl/-ySb34z8VoWnrYoJ.m3u8?v=60b&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775963300003841/vid/avc1/1280x720/g0fBN2yzbvqOYJGm.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775963300003841/vid/avc1/1920x1080/TdGGzDDzGdkw92DK.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775963300003841/vid/avc1/480x270/3KX3puVgyJg0MgVO.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939775963300003841/vid/avc1/640x360/DC755Gt1dO9M7J92.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Now, back to the story you came for.

As the DOJ cracks down, Dr. Oz says the real change is in how they're fighting fraud: stopping the scams before the money is even gone.  
  
He called it a paradigm shift.  
  
“What we're doing today is changing the paradigm,” he explained.  
  
“Not just going after bad guys and putting them behind bars, but actually getting ahead of these schemes, so the money never leaves our bank account.”  
  
He warned that once the money is stolen, it’s practically impossible to get back.  
  
“Because by the time we find out that these criminals have stolen and the money has left the building, it's already offshore, somewhere in some foreign country's vaults where foreign leaders are rejoicing in the fact they took advantage of the American people.”  
  
That’s why, he said, this approach is so aggressive.  
  
“That's why we use the word CRUSHING fraud, waste, and abuse.”  
  
He made it clear this isn't an old-fashioned fight.  
  
“Because this is not just a nice thing to do in an accounting sense, picking up what we can claw back. It doesn't happen that easily.”  
  
“This is a modern era. There are modern tools being used to attack us, and we need even more modern ways, including AI, to take them down.” <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939776917479084032/pl/zv4BI8rrSgrRQd2T.m3u8?v=570&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939776917479084032/vid/avc1/1920x1080/ip12yXMFwfZgSw7Y.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939776917479084032/vid/avc1/640x360/HcTRQZvucBwCclzj.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939776917479084032/vid/avc1/480x270/YbGprAF1kKbA0OeC.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939776917479084032/vid/avc1/1280x720/SV9QIIg7KecaPoFh.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Dr. Oz also made a direct appeal to Americans, calling on them to be part of the solution.  
  
He asked ordinary people to help expose fraudsters by becoming whistleblowers.  
  
“We need your help. That's my big plea. We need your help, the American people.”  
  
He made it clear just how much this effort depends on everyday citizens.  
  
“Why? Over half of the whistleblower tips that we get are for healthcare fraud and over half of the fraud against our government is in healthcare.”  
  
“So we need your help; both to protect your own important information—don't give it away because con artists come to your door and try to get it—but give us tips.”  
  
He reiterated that patriotic Americans are critical allies in the fight.  
  
“It only happens in health care because we know we have allies, the American people.”  
  
He even left viewers with the number to call.  
  
“Write this down, 1-800-HHS-TIPS.” <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939777542728097792/pl/zXZDENgSNnBwCJab.m3u8?v=913&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939777542728097792/vid/avc1/480x270/JC-o9-iSDy2kfHYZ.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939777542728097792/vid/avc1/1920x1080/IcMOb_S0TH8Bt6AE.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939777542728097792/vid/avc1/640x360/ncx94h83IpqD6cC0.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939777542728097792/vid/avc1/1280x720/tZUmzG31mI3mbblO.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Finally, Dr. Oz shined a light on the even bigger problem lurking behind fraud: outright abuse and waste in the healthcare system.  
  
“And I'll leave you with one last thought,” he said.  
  
“In addition to the massive fraud, especially from foreign entities trying to invade America using their financial tools and criminal mindsets, we also have 25% of all of our money being spent probably subject to abuse.”  
  
He clarified the difference.  
  
“And that's not fraud. This is abuse and waste. Money not being used wisely.”  
  
To tackle this, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are rolling out a new model.  
  
“We just launched a new model called ‘Wiser’ with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation—that is looking at ways for us to identify inappropriate use of services, services that are wasteful and should not be offered to the American people because they could hurt them.”  
  
For Dr. Oz, this isn’t just about money. It’s also about keeping Americans safe.  
  
“They're not providing value for these wonderful Americans whose health is being taken advantage of to generate higher revenue for providers.”  
  
He closed with a promise that the fight isn’t stopping here.  
  
“We're not going to tolerate it anymore, and we're going to use data analytics, real-time monitoring—and unhesitating and unwavering pursuit of the law to make sure this happens.”  
  
This was a turning point in American healthcare.  
  
The era of waste, fraud and abuse is over.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939778134284419072/pl/PyyKBSTvHx-tUDuD.m3u8?v=cd5&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939778134284419072/vid/avc1/480x270/yl5c840o1fk8PkpM.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939778134284419072/vid/avc1/1920x1080/uGwiEXx8yqijoxdF.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939778134284419072/vid/avc1/640x360/cDVuo5sKg10iwZom.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939778134284419072/vid/avc1/1280x720/uIm0iYSlzwKQAE3s.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

They buried a cure for deadly infections.  
  
In the 1940s, UV blood irradiation was curing sepsis, pneumonia, and even polio.  
  
But the American Medical Association rigged a study to kill it, ensuring this life-saving therapy vanished.  
  
Decades later, Trump curiously suggested putting light inside the body to treat COVID.  
  
The media mocked him with bleach jokes.  
  
But he may have unknowingly referenced a powerful light-based therapy with proven results.

Sunlight isn't the enemy.  
  
And the campaign against it is a lie.  
  
@MidwesternDoc's report uncovers the shocking truth: almost everything you’ve been told about sunlight is wrong—and it’s costing us our health.

@MidwesternDoc In the 1980s, dermatologists launched a PR blitz blaming sunlight for cancer.  
  
Why? To push expensive skin cancer treatments.  
  
And I’m sure the skincare industry has enjoyed the fruits of the sunlight scare as well. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939371121293287425/pl/HCK-ACB3x8JC5AXP.m3u8?v=584&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939371121293287425/vid/avc1/480x270/438bRXKk_Wm45Bzn.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939371121293287425/vid/avc1/640x360/TpIWdYz1lcAj_WT3.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1939371121293287425/vid/avc1/1280x720/MizXyJrePmzWhfM8.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The Shocking Truth About COVID Vaccine Shedding  
  
The most puzzling part of the COVID injection is its ability to “shed” and harm people who never even got the shot.  
  
@MidwesternDoc spent a year investigating over 1,500 of these reports.  
  
What emerged is one of the most alarming patterns of the pandemic.  
  
🧵 THREAD

Everyone’s talking about shedding, but almost no one knows what it really is.  
  
Shortly after the COVID vaccine rollout, thousands of unvaccinated people started reporting strange symptoms—oftentimes right after being near someone recently vaccinated.  
  
They hadn’t gotten the shot. Yet they were sick.  
  
And the symptoms were eerily consistent.

Shedding isn’t just some blog theory. It’s backed by peer-reviewed research that was carefully examined by other scientists before being published.

EXCLUSIVE: The Shocking “Anti-Human” Plot for 2030  
  
A terrified whistleblower has come forward to expose a secret plot to extract biometric data from mRNA vaccine recipients.  
  
But they don’t just want your data. They also want your mind.  
  
And the filmmakers behind Died Suddenly are back with a new movie to uncover it all.  
  
🧵 THREAD

Transhumanism is a topic that a lot of people have yet to grasp in full.  
  
Mainly because there are so many aspects to it, so many ways of deploying the technology to achieve it, that it would take shows entirely dedicated to it every day to cover all of the developments in this arena.  
  
But the filmmakers from the notorious movie Died Suddenly have been contacted by a whistleblower who has shared shocking information with them surrounding the COVID shots.  
  
They’re now releasing a follow-up film called Died Suddenly 2: Nano Sapiens ([ds2nano.com](http://ds2nano.com/)), which dives into these new allegations. Edward Szall and Matthew Skow join us now.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938758021246525440/pl/QUB2_N5igOAIkG4u.m3u8?v=522&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938758021246525440/vid/avc1/480x270/MaIq4kSSL4VYed5n.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938758021246525440/vid/avc1/640x360/pjdsX6tLS4xz4qMf.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938758021246525440/vid/avc1/1280x720/7isYioZK6mcLIcIR.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The discussion opened with Matt admitting they never planned to make a sequel to Died Suddenly, but felt they had no choice after hearing what a whistleblower uncovered.  
  
According to this source, even before COVID started, five countries met with BioNTech to design a system enabling vaccinated people to transmit biometric data in real time.  
  
Matt described this as bigger than anything Snowden or WikiLeaks ever uncovered—painting a picture of data moving seamlessly through the vaccine, through the body, into the phone, and straight to centralized databases.  
  
He insisted this wasn’t some improvised scheme but something carefully laid out years in advance, warning it amounted to a sweeping surveillance system disguised as public health.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938758289870721024/pl/r55GEUHwN-LiOgPH.m3u8?v=44c&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938758289870721024/vid/avc1/480x270/HEZ-vZ21BQWqbR6b.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938758289870721024/vid/avc1/640x360/ebKwFbI9I2-_2-xv.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938758289870721024/vid/avc1/1280x720/ymBkfe4TkXN03VdR.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

10 Shocking Stories the Media Buried Today  
  
#10 - @SenJohnKennedy says anyone with basic law knowledge knows activist judges just MADE UP universal injunctions to block President Trump’s agenda.  
  
He writes:  
  
“Anybody who knows a law book from an L.L. Bean catalog knows that federal judges just made up the concept of universal injunctions. If you disagree with a President or Congress, fill out a hurt feelings report—but you can’t put their actions on hold because you don’t like them.”

They finally weighed in and it could change history.  
  
In a monumental win for Trump, SCOTUS just shut down activist judges blocking his agenda.  
  
The president wasted no time celebrating, delivering an impromptu press conference.  
  
Then he dropped a MAJOR clue about what’s coming next for his policy.

It could be the turning point for Trump’s presidency.  
  
Let’s roll the clips and break it all down.

It was a defining moment for the Trump presidency.  
  
For years, President Trump’s efforts to deliver on his campaign promises had been repeatedly blocked by activist judges, often from liberal districts, issuing sweeping nationwide injunctions that stalled policies voters had supported at the ballot box.  
  
That pattern hit a wall today.  
  
In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship can move forward in parts of the country, striking at the core of judges’ power to block presidential policies nationwide.  
  
Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the Court’s six Republican-appointed justices, made clear why the ruling mattered:  
  
“These injunctions—known as ‘universal injunctions’—likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts.”  
  
It was a significant legal win for Trump, delivering a long-awaited check on what his allies have described as a rogue judiciary determined to stymie his agenda.  
  
As the decision hit the wires, CNN scrambled to break it down for viewers. Their senior legal analyst, Elie Honig, tried to summarize the ruling’s impact in real time.  
  
“It looks like at first glimpse, and we're just starting, it looks like the court has put some limits on the ability of district courts, trial courts, to issue those kind of rulings,” Honig said.  
  
He continued, “It looks like the court has said district courts only have the power to do that in certain, very narrow circumstances.”  
  
“So we're going to go through this and get the details soon, but that's the gist.” <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938664104043892736/pl/EtS2e7NKjs0sWuKF.m3u8?v=bbd&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938664104043892736/vid/avc1/1920x1080/dCFGh8STqDRJNMPR.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938664104043892736/vid/avc1/1280x720/T9gzMDsPMIe-48N5.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938664104043892736/vid/avc1/640x360/HpoThcBtjDDXmo4E.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938664104043892736/vid/avc1/480x270/whQVizPntDdKa54H.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Most people think Tylenol is a harmless pill for pain and inflammation.  
  
But it sends 56,000 Americans to the ER every year.  
  
What about NSAIDs? Even deadlier. Over 16,000 Americans die each year from NSAID-induced bleeding.  
  
So, what do you do if you have chronic pain? Don’t just numb it. Find the real cause.  
  
This report reveals how the medical industry profits off your pain, how to uncover your root cause, and one cheap but suppressed treatment that actually works.  
  
🧵 THREAD

Chronic pain is a goldmine for the medical industry.  
  
If you regularly find yourself in pain, rarely is the root cause explored.  
  
You’re told to try pills. Then, when that stops working, they give you injections. Then surgery. Then more pills.  
  
Each step digs you deeper into a system designed to profit off your suffering, not fix it.  
  
It keeps you stuck in a loop of pills and pain. Forever.
