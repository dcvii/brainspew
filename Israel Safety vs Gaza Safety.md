# How do you explain that the death toll in Israel from Hamas rocket attacks is much, much lower than in Gaza from Israeli airstrikes?

This is Shiri.

ok, it’s a stock image, so sue me. i’m not putting pictures of my actual kids on here.

Shiri is a 9-year-old Israeli girl. Here’s how much has been spent on keeping Shiri and children like her safe during war:

- $3 billion – the cost of the Iron Dome missile defense system to date
- $2 billion – the cost of development of Iron Beam and similar defense systems
- $250 million – the rough total cost of the interceptor missiles fired (at $40,000 a pop) to take down Hamas rockets that were on route to Israeli cities, in this round of the conflict alone
- $200 million – the rough total cost of the over 9,000 public bomb shelters in Israel
- $200 million/year – the cost of running the Homefront Command, which is responsible for civilian welfare during war

But wait, there’s more:

Shiri’s parents spent $25,000 on a private bomb shelter in their apartment. They did this whether or not they wanted to – by Israeli law, construction plans are not legal unless they include bomb shelter space for everyone in the building. There’s also a bomb shelter in her school, in her doctor’s office, next to the local playground, and in the community center where she takes ballet classes.

When Hamas (or Hezbollah, or the Houthis, etc) fire a rocket at Shiri’s city, here’s what happens:

The Iron Dome radar tracks the missile’s path, and a computer calculates its trajectory. Seconds later sirens sound across Shiri’s town.

Shiri has been taught how to react when the sirens sound since she was old enough to walk. She and her friends make their way quickly to their school’s bomb shelter.

The odds are good that the rocket will be shot down in midair. If it isn’t, the odds are still very good that Shiri will be fine. She’s in a well-constructed bomb shelter, and will survive anything short of a direct hit - and possibly even that.

If the rocket attacks become too frequent or too dangerous, Shiri and her family will be evacuated. This will be mandatory. The government will give them a monthly stipend to cover the cost of relocation to a government evacuee center.

This is Sumaya.

or maybe a stock photo of a Muslim girl, but let’s pretend

Sumaya is a 9-year-old girl from Gaza. Here’s how much has been spent on keeping Sumaya and children like her alive:

$0.

- $0 for defensive weapons development.
- $0 on public bomb shelters.
- $0 on coordinating the evacuation or protection of civilians during war.
- $0 on stockpiling food and other resources in case of war (even when Hamas knows a war is about to start)

But wait, there’s more:

Israel limits concrete imports into Gaza so that there will be juuuust enough for civilian construction, with none left over for massive underground tunnel systems. In what will come as a surprise to absolutely nobody, Hamas takes the concrete and uses it all to build massive underground tunnel systems anyway. Gazan civilians are, as usual, caught in the middle.

As a result, Sumaya’s house only looks like it’s made of concrete. In reality, it’s made of cinderblocks, with a layer of concrete over them to hold them together. If any rocket hits her home, whether it’s a 2,000-pound bomb or one of Hamas’ simpler explosives, the entire thing will probably collapse. It might collapse even if the rocket hits the neighbor’s house.

When a war breaks out, here’s what happens:

Sumaya and her family sit in their cinderblock house with no idea what’s happening or what they can do about it. Their house may be in the safe zone, or it could be right next to a Hamas launch site that’s about to go active. There’s no way for them to know.

There’s a massive underground tunnel nearby that could keep them safe from any bomb in the world, but they aren’t allowed to use it – the tunnels are for Hamas soldiers, not for children.

If the active combat zone is moving toward Sumaya’s house, the Gaza government will do nothing to warn her. In fact, the Gaza government might actively block the road out of town.

If Sumaya and her family do successfully evacuate, they’ll end up in an overcrowded UN facility. Distribution of food and water will be sporadic at best. There will be no government assistance. There will be no recompense for their lost income. For that reason, Sumaya’s father is likely to decide to keep his family at home despite the risk.

There are other reasons, of course. Some Israeli bombs are powerful enough to take down a building, while Hamas bombs could only kill 30+ people if they hit the middle of a crowded street.

But if Israel hadn’t evacuated hundreds of thousands of people, build thousands of bomb shelters, spent hundreds of millions educating the public in rocket safety, and invested billions in rocket defense, many Hamas rockets would be hitting crowded areas. Instead, Hamas rockets are mostly being blown up mid-air or hitting empty streets.

Tl;dr: investing billions in defense works.
