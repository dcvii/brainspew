### Doing politics the right way, he offers a woke, far-left future for the Dems. Fuck.

It is not hard to see the appeal of Zohran Mamdani. He is, after all, not Andrew Cuomo — another corrupt, old, Democratic sexual harasser who’s already spent years in power and thinks he’s entitled to be mayor because of his last name. He doesn’t appear steeped in petty corruption like Mayor Adams. He’s not as *obviously* nutty as Sliwa seems to be. And he has done politics, *pace* Ezra, the right way: listening to the [other side](https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1857410216733651146), earning people’s votes one by one, talking to people on the street, and, of course, mastering our new collective replacement for civil discourse: 30-second videos on TikTok.

Those videos are fantastic. Check out [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@zohran_k_mamdani/video/7455134610977033502) in favor of freezing rents in NYC, with the man, in full suit and tie, jumping into a freezing bay and out again. Or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyL4PsmA3u8) about “Halalflation” — on how licensing food carts has become a grift for middlemen. Or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ8Dt5NtsNQ), when he sits down with two old white men — one for Adams and one for Cuomo — and tries to talk them into an alternative. If I were a Democrat, I’d be thrilled to see someone this fresh, this approachable, and this *likable* as a new face of the party. He’s young and charming and upbeat in a party lacking in all three.

He’s also right to focus his campaign on the question of affordability. New York City is ridiculously expensive in every way; the toll that high taxes and inflation have taken on working-class residents has been huge. Capitalism isn’t working the way it should, and we need to reboot our economic policies to address that as a priority. Trump has promised this but is delivering the opposite. Just this morning, we see an accelerating inflation rate. An opening beckons.

So I get why Mamdani is popular. And I have little doubt he will be the next mayor, as well as a major national figurehead for the Democrats — a nice dose of youth to a party debilitated by seniorityitis. He will define the Democrats nationally — certainly if the GOP has any say in it. And in many ways, he is the perfect candidate for today’s Dem elites: wealthy, woke, with a degree in “Africana studies.” His only problem is not being female — but since he denies that the [category](https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1565713944379023360) of female exists, no big deal I suppose. He will give the MSNBC/Bulwark crowd a new lease on self-righteousness.

But to be honest, when I read his proposals, at first I thought I was reading a high-schooler’s essay. Free *everything*! I mean: why not? Free universal childcare for kids as young as six weeks old.Free buses for everyone. Rent control for everyone already privileged by it. Subsidized collective supermarkets. $30-an-hour minimum wage by 2030 — up from $16.50. Woohoo! And [arresting Bibi](https://nypost.com/2025/10/15/us-news/zohran-mamdani-wont-say-hamas-should-lay-down-its-weapons-stands-by-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/) as an added bonus. (I have to say the last plank might even tempt me to vote for him.)

The problem, of course, is how to pay for it. And a NYC mayor, quite simply, cannot. Mamdani simply won’t have the power. None of the tax hikes he proposes — a new 2 percent tax on everyone earning over $1 million a year, and jacking up the corporate tax to 11.5 percent — can be passed by his council. Albany has the final say, will almost certainly say no, and the Democratic governor, Hochul, opposes the hikes.

So a lot of this is purely performative, no? He has a good chance to create his Soviet bodegas and, in all likelihood, freeze rents if he replaces members of the board. (That will, of course, make housing availability and expense [even worse](https://manhattan.institute/article/issues-2020-rent-control-does-not-make-housing-more-affordable).) He may be able to wangle some increase in NYC’s minimum wage — by trying to bypass Albany. But doubling it in five years? Meh. All of the economic stuff is iffy because of the very probable lack of funding. Maybe a big victory will change the dynamics and allow a big tax hike in one of the most highly taxed cities on earth. But it’s hard to believe it.

So what’s left? What’s left is cultural leftism on hormones. You may get daycare — but it will come with full woke indoctrination of kids from the earliest years on. No more “boys”or “girls” allowed! Mamdani, as we all know, regards the police as the enforcers of “ [white supremacy](https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1291551446689878016),” supports the end of Israel as a [Jewish state](https://www.algemeiner.com/2025/06/05/zohran-mamdani-refuses-say-israel-has-right-exist-jewish-state-nyc-mayoral-debate/), will subsidize the [transing of children](https://x.com/benryanwriter/status/1937185109591097729) with no safeguards, and has erased gays and lesbians from our own [history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEvVSpN0BXg), re-marginalizing us as “queers”. There’s no one the woke left hates more than an empowered and integrated person who just happens to be gay or lesbian.

Like all good critical-theory racists, Mamdani believes in a racial hierarchy with whites, Jews, and Asians as oppressors, and blacks and Hispanics and “queers” as victims;he wants to [make](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mamdani-proposes-massive-amount-legal-defense-funding-immigrants-trump-proofing-nyc-plan) NYC “the strongest sanctuary city in the country” *—* i.e. go to war with ICE — and [kill](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/15/zohran-mamdani-revives-dei-goal-ending-gifted-talented-program-nyc/) the educational programs that help gifted poor kids in kindergarten — because most turn out to be of the oppressor races. A racist, in other words — to his fingertips.

And he is a near-perfect foil for Trump. “Queer liberation means defund the police,” he once [tweeted](https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1324520792231714816) — though he says he [no longer wants](https://nypost.com/2025/07/30/us-news/zohran-mamdani-doubles-down-on-disbanding-nypd-unit-that-responded-to-nyc-shooting-but-backs-off-unpopular-defund-stance/) to defund the cops. It’s the kind of 2020 slogan almost designed to ensure MAGA control of the national discourse forever. And if I were a show-runner on the Trump show, Mamdani would be central to provoking the kind of real fascist putsch that Trump and Miller are itching for, if they can find a suitable provocation. Mamdani is that provocation. He will go to war with ICE in NYC, and Trump will go to war with him. And broadcast it every day.

In 2022, Mamdani [declared](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/can-dsa-go-the-distance/) of his political career: “For me, there’s no point in doing this without D.S.A.” The Democratic Socialists of America [favor](https://convention2021.dsausa.org/files/sites/23/2021/06/Democratic-Socialists-of-America-2021-Platform-Second-Draft.pdf) full amnesty for all illegal immigrants, abolition of the Senate, voting rights for noncitizens, and public ownership of major corporations. Since he won the nomination, he has softened on some of these points, but remains a DSA member and fan. New Yorkers can decide if he’s sincere. Obviously I don’t believe a word he says about moderation.

But it’s not up to me. And I know many sane New Yorkers who are going to vote for him anyway — in part because of his opponents. I understand. But this is also what many Dems want: a woke party dedicated to non-whites and non-Asians and non-Jews and non-white queers (especially the queerest of the queers, the trans), equity over excellence, race over merit, ideology over economics, and leveling down rather than raising up. It’s a vision made feasible by capitalism’s failure to correct itself, but a vision that will, in all likelihood, ensure MAGA dominance for a very long time.

Which, in some way, is what the far left may actually want: increase the contradictions, ratchet up the potential for street violence, create disorder, pit the races against each other, and revolution will arrive. And now they have their charming, smiling vehicle for the project. My money — and history’s lesson, I’d argue — is on the Red Caesar and not the Blue One in a raw American fight for illiberal control. Which is why the man most happy about Mamdani’s rise is sitting in his White Palace, waiting for yet another moment to tear the constitution to shreds.

### The Vandal-In-Chief

I’m a conservative, so I know I have no place in today’s GOP. But to observe the president taking a literal wrecking ball to the White House in order to build a massive, palatial, Mar-a-Lago knock-off ballroom that will be twice the size of the current White House is to remember that Trump believes this is *his* house — not ours — and wants to remind everyone in perpetuity. It’s a huge sign that he will refuse to leave office in three years’ time, just as he refused to leave the first time.

It’s a ballroom for a monarchy, not a republic. The only public consultation was, of course, a lie: that the East Wing would not be touched. There are loopholes in historic preservation of the White House, because it was long assumed that presidents would be sane, respectful of the public, and voluntarily submit to what the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 says about all historic buildings. (The White House was exempted in case urgent national security needs were there — like the bunker under the East Wing.) As in many other areas, our laws never anticipated a total madman in charge — or a majority of Americans who could vote for such a person.

The National Capital Planning Act of 1952 mandates compatibility with the historic fabric (e.g., no “overwhelming” additions), and demolition without this review is illegal. Ditto demos of buildings filled with asbestos (which the East Wing was). Trump ignored all these laws — as he usually does — to build this gilded monstrosity. MAGA would be fine if he demolished the entire White House and replaced it with a gleaming office tower with TRUMP on it. Or at least, there is nothing in their current stance to say why they wouldn’t.

Some may object that this is the most trivial matter to be concerned with. It is not up there with stealing $230 million in petty cash from taxpayer coffers by installing flunkies at the DOJ, taking massive bribes from foreign dictators, committing war crimes routinely in the Caribbean, and posting memes of himself showering half of his fellow citizens in literal shit. The bottom has already fallen out of any semblance of public dignity for the United States government.

But there’s something about the visual of *literally* demolishing the White House with no warning, no consultation, and no procedures. That’s a signal that he thinks he can do anything, and that the very White House is *his*, not ours. Grandiose building projects have long been part of any tyrant’s core ambition — it’s how the first Roman emperor, Augustus, declared to the entire world that the [republic was dead](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/10/23/white-house-east-wing-demolition-trump-architecture/):

> In the premier authoritarian regimes of the 21st century — China and the gulf states — rapid construction of massive infrastructure establishes legitimacy and consoles the populace for its thorough disenfranchisement from power … Buildings are gifts to the people from leaders who are infallible, not the organic expression of civic values and ideals.

We are all in the hands of a man completely out of control, whipsawed by insane megalomania and narcissism, lunging and leering at our traditions like a distracted animal, trampling the laws, norms, and core foundations of a liberal democracy. I propose a re-naming until 2028: the White Palace — fit for a monarch. I also propose demolishing whatever Trump builds as soon as a non-MAGA president arrives. Which may, of course, be never.

“I’m old enough to remember the public slinging of mud that accompanied the angry democratic debate over the design and construction of the WWII Memorial on the National Mall. But when it comes to the People’s House, not a peep. Would any home owner — or HOA — allow such a massive demolition and construction project by a temporary tenant without being consulted?” - [Alexis Ludwig](https://substack.com/@alexisludwig/note/c-168674223).

“Obama went through the National Capital Planning Commission as the law requires. \[Renovation\] plans were submitted, reviewed, revised. Open bids were made/considered. If you can’t see the difference between that and what Trump is doing, you are beyond help,” - [David Shuster](https://x.com/davidshuster/status/1981144673143181374).

“We don’t blow up boats off Miami because 25% of the time suspicion is wrong. We shouldn’t do it off Venezuela either. These are small outboards with no fentanyl and no path to Florida. We can’t just kill indiscriminately because we are not at war. It’s summary execution!” - [Rand Paul](https://x.com/senrandpaul/status/1980778628305625589).

“It speaks volumes that two of the members of Congress whom Trump is targeting — Tom Massie and Rand Paul — are two of the most anti-interventionist, anti-censorship, and anti-swamp politicians in all of DC,” - [Glenn Greenwald](https://x.com/ggreenwald/status/1980060161294405739).

“The ‘Gaza genocide’ calumny has become the Left’s equivalent of the ‘stolen election’ hoax on the American Right — a baseless accusation that signals ideological allegiance precisely *because* it defies logic and evidence,” - [Maarten Boudry](https://quillette.substack.com/p/they-dont-believe-it-either).

“The technology is just gonna get better and better and better and better. And it’s gonna get easier and easier, and more and more convenient, and more and more pleasurable to be alone with images on a screen, given to us by people who do not love us but want our money. Which is all right. In low doses, right? But if that’s the basic main staple of your diet, you’re gonna die. In a meaningful way, you’re going to die,” - [David Foster Wallace](https://x.com/ekuyda/status/1980515271002714316).

### Dissents Of The Week

Here’s one from “a Dish subscriber, a long-time follower of yours from the *New Republic* days, an economist, and a student of Israeli history and contemporary developments”:

> A misleading section of [your column](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-secret-of-trumps-gaza-triumph) claims that Bibi had to have the plan forced on him and that Trump’s ability to coerce him and the Israeli government was the difference. Although the motivations of the parties are hard to discern, your treatment of the process is highly questionable, especially given the fact that the Trump plan is far more favorable to Israeli interests than prior plans. For a very different but well-informed analysis of how the deal emerged, I suggest you read Amit Segal’s recent piece in *The Free Press*, “The Inside Story of the Gaza Deal.”

You need to take this up with the senior White House official who [told Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/10/qatar-was-the-turning-point-how-israels-bombing-of-doha-ignited-a-peace-process-00604017) that Netanyahu’s brazen attack on Qatar

> allowed the president to put maximum pressure on Israel, which he did. And it really did force Israel into a position to submit to peace.

Under your scenario, why was any US pressure needed? Another dissent:

> Your piece missed the mark entirely. The underlying premise appears to be that Israel could have had its hostages back under a “similar” deal either a year ago or six months ago, but only did so now by being forced to “submit”, so that pressure on Israel is what made this happen.
> 
> Trump’s re-election gave Israel the ability to prosecute the war in its interests. That meant — as you concede — the desecration of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran’s air defenses and nuclear program. (Sure, some of that happened pre-Trump, but usually with Biden/Harris warning Israel *not* to take action.) The bombing in Doha was the final piece that got the neighborhood to wake up. The only “price” Israel paid for that attack was to deliver a meaningless apology. Qatar was shaken and fearful and responded by pressuring Hamas to accept the Trump plan.
> 
> Yes, Trump also pushed Netanyahu to accept, but Netanyahu and Israel quickly and gladly did. Qatar (along with Turkey — Erdogan among the most ardent Israel haters on earth) also signed onto the Sharm El Sheikh framework. Qatar effectively gave up Hamas in full to Israel and the dustbin of history. That would not have happened in April 2025 or October 2024.
> 
> Which leads me to my final point. Yes, there have been numerous proposals over the last two years to free the Israeli hostages. Israel had agreed to many, and Hamas had accepted none. But none of those proposals involved the explicit disarmament of Hamas and its exclusion from the future of Gaza. Trump’s plan did, and Hamas signed it.
> 
> Whether those points are ultimately implemented remains to be seen. Hamas seems to be content publicly executing Gazans by the dozen, with none of the “free Palestine” crowd caring a whit.

Forgive my skepticism. This was a deal for hostages, period. Everything else is completely up in the air. No country is going to send troops to disarm or fight Hamas in Gaza. Israel controls half of it, but the idea of a redeveloped Israeli Gaza where Palestinians will re-settle seems logistically impossible for security reasons. So back to square one.

Netanyahu fucked up badly in Qatar. So he made some phony promises, got the hostages home, and will resume the war at some point - probably soon. He made a tactical error in Qatar, and turned it into a slightly better strategic success for himself than for Hamas. But real peace and a workable settlement? No sign as yet.

More dissents — on this topic and others — are over on the pod page, arriving in your in-tray shortly. Please keep the criticism coming: **dish@andrewsullivan.com**.
