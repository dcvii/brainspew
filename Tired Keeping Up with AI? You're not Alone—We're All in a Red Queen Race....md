### "How can I possibly keep up with all this?" — I think it's important to acknowledge one of the biggest feelings we all have about AI under the surface. We're all racing just to keep up...

*This one will be brief, but I think it’s important.*

*It’s not easy to keep up on AI, and the purpose of this post is to remind you you’re not alone. Share it with someone who needs to hear that!*

*Yes, most of the time I write about easier ways to keep up on this Substack. That won’t stop. In fact, I think it’s critically important to socialize AI fluency because the stakes have never been higher.*

*But I also think we can take a moment every now and then to look squarely at the overall landscape around us. We are all in a Red Queen race—a race where we have to go fast just to stand still.*

*Here’s what that feels like…*

## Waking up winded

The day starts with a soft chime from your phone—someone has dropped a link to the latest “GPT-something” demo in the team chat, complete with fire-emoji encouragements. You haven’t even tasted coffee yet, but the thought arrives fully formed: ***I’m already behind***. That feeling isn’t laziness; it’s the soundtrack of modern knowledge work, as common as the smell of instant espresso and the glare of a ring-light. We used to greet the morning with a to-do list; now we greet it with the suspicion we’ve missed a software release while we slept.

Numbers back up that gut punch. Three out of four desk workers admit they feel an “urgent need” to become AI experts, yet most have logged less than half a day of actual training. Executives aren’t immune, either—nearly all say they feel relentless pressure to deploy generative tools across their organizations. In other words, the hierarchy offers no shelter: the anxiety flows upward and downward at the same speed, pooled beneath every title and pay grade.

This mismatch—sky-high expectations paired with threadbare preparation—creates a peculiar morning ritual. We check email not for instructions but for evidence that we’re still in the race; we scroll LinkedIn hoping today’s miracle workflow looks familiar; we skim headlines praying the acronym soup hasn’t gained another letter. The treadmill is already set to sprint when our feet touch it, and the speed dial is broken off.

So if your first emotion at sunrise is exhaustion, know that it isn’t personal failure. It’s a logical human response to an environment that accelerates before you’ve had a chance to lace your shoes. You wake up winded because the race began while you were asleep—and the pace is being set by the machines, not us.

## What the “Red Queen race” really means

Picture the scene in *Through the Looking-Glass*: Alice and the Red Queen run so fast the landscape blurs, yet when they finally stop, they’re exactly where they started. The Queen coolly explains that in her kingdom “it takes all the running you can do, to stay in the same place.” Lewis Carroll meant it as whimsical logic, but the image has escaped the book and lodged itself in modern jargon.

Biologists first adopted the metaphor to describe co-evolving species—gazelles get faster because cheetahs get faster, and vice versa. Economists borrowed it for markets in which every company invests just to match the upgrades of rivals. In both cases, progress is relative; standing still is the same as falling back because the ground beneath you is moving.

Now swap gazelles for knowledge workers and predators for product releases. Each new model or feature resets the baseline of “normal” productivity, so yesterday’s breakthrough becomes today’s minimum expectation. You master a prompt style, the model changes its rules; you learn a dashboard, the interface reinvents itself. Motion doesn’t feel optional—it feels baked into survival.

The unsettling part is that effort no longer guarantees distance. You can sprint, debug, upskill, and still discover you’re only maintaining parity with a moving target. That’s the Red Queen race in today’s office: relentless acceleration with no finish line, only the obligation to keep pace with everyone else who’s also running. Knowing the term doesn’t slow the treadmill, but it puts a name to the dizziness, and sometimes that name is the first step toward breathing easier.

## The news cycle that sprints faster than you can read

AI acceleration isn’t an abstract concept. You feel it in your body these days.

Before you even open Slack, the headlines have already nudged the finish line. A late-night tweet hints at “GPT-Next,” financial reporters run with it before dawn, and by breakfast the tech newsletters are stacking speculation on top of rumor. The model isn’t released, benchmarked, or even named, yet the mere whisper is enough to declare yesterday’s knowledge obsolete. In that instant, your mental backlog doubles: learn what the new thing is, then decide whether you now look slow for not knowing it already.

This isn’t classic hype, where marketing inflates a single product launch. It’s an always-on drumbeat that frames potential upgrades as fait accompli. Journalists race one another for scoops; vendors tease road-maps to keep investors buzzing; influencers churn explainer threads so they can say “First!” when the embargo lifts. Each actor has a rational reason to accelerate the story, and together they create a collective illusion that the ground is moving even faster than it is.

The result is a strange cognitive triage. You skim five articles, bookmark three deep dives, promise yourself you’ll “circle back” after lunch—then a push notification proclaims a competitor demoed something newer at a closed-door event. The stack of unread tabs becomes a silent accusation: *Why haven’t you processed me yet?* Even if half the rumors fade or the timelines slip, the psychological debt is already charged to your attention span.

Over time the pace trains your nervous system to expect constant displacement. You start reading with one eye on the horizon, ready for the next leap that will render the current leap passé. It’s less “fear of missing out” and more “certainty of being overtaken.” And because the cycle resets every 24 hours, the sprint never resolves into a steady jog. The news moves faster than ink can dry—or than a human brain can integrate—leaving most of us breathless before the workday officially begins.

## Prompting: a durable edge and a moving target

Prompting began as a party trick—type a clever sentence, watch the model jump. Then people noticed something deeper: the phrasing, ordering, and context you supply can swing outcomes from garbled to genius. In a world awash with similar tools, that knack became a secret handshake, a way to separate the merely automated from the artfully amplified. Far from dying, the craft has settled in as one of the few levers an individual can still pull to wring disproportionate value out of the same shared model.

But durability doesn’t equal stability. Each new release tweaks system-message rules, swaps default “personalities,” adjusts token limits, or introduces hidden steering logic. Yesterday’s elegant chain-of-thought suddenly triggers truncation; the clever JSON wrapper you perfected now violates a stricter schema. Learning to prompt starts to feel like mastering a foreign language whose grammar updates quarterly, weekly, or daily. The underlying principle—guide the model with precision—remains constant, yet the idiom keeps shifting under your feet.

That moving target raises the cost of sharpening the edge. Early adopters now spend lunch breaks running A/B tests, logging failures, and iterating prompts the way software engineers refactor code. Copy-pasting a template works often enough, but the magic hides in micro-adjustments tuned to your domain, your dataset, your tolerance for hallucination. Craft replaces cookbook, and you need both a library of prompts and the meta-skills to know how to mix and match them to your context. The skills you banked last quarter are not worthless, just incomplete—tools in a set that needs perpetual expansion.

The paradox is that as prompt engineering matures, it becomes both more essential and more opaque. Casual users see the outputs getting better and assume the interface has grown simpler. Insiders know the opposite is happening: the ceiling rises, but so does the expertise required to reach it. A durable edge, then, is not a one-time certification; it’s a commitment to ongoing whet-stone work, a readiness to revisit fundamentals whenever the model’s rules of engagement shift.

And because mastery now demands constant tinkering, the simple act of keeping your prompts sharp doubles as a signal to colleagues that you’re still sprinting. That signal, in turn, feeds the lateral pressure covered in the next section—the quiet competition where everyone’s refinement loop becomes someone else’s new baseline.

## Peer-to-peer pressure inside companies

If the news cycle sets the treadmill in motion, colleagues crank the incline. Monday’s stand-up begins with one teammate demoing a slick AI workflow that slashes a task from two hours to twenty minutes. Applause ripples through the call, cameras flicker on to capture nods of admiration—and suddenly everyone else’s stopwatch feels embarrassingly slow. The benchmark hasn’t just inched upward; it has vaulted over your weekend.

Managers, eager to scale that success, hold the demo up as proof of what *should* be possible. Yet only a fraction of the team received formal training, and those lessons were already dated by last quarter’s model update. The gap between the showcased “best practice” and the average comfort level widens into resentment. Surveys hint at the fallout: a meaningful slice of employees quietly resist or even sabotage AI roll-outs they feel unprepared for, preferring to take a performance hit rather than risk public failure.

That tension births a visibility arms race. Early adopters broadcast every shortcut to signal relevance; late adopters camouflage their learning curves, hoping to avoid the spotlight until they’ve caught up. In chat threads you’ll find boasting (“Knocked out the report in ten minutes, thanks Gemini!”) sitting alongside strategic silence—people who used the same tool but say nothing, worried the bar will climb yet again if they reveal how. Transparency, the virtue that supposedly powers knowledge work, turns selective and defensive in many cases.

Ironically, the Red Queen race is self-fueling: the more we display speed, the faster the collective pace becomes, forcing even reluctant runners to sprint or risk appearing stationary. And because this pressure flows sideways rather than down the org chart, it can escape leaders’ notice until friction blooms into missed deadlines or quiet attrition. The stage is set for mandates—the moment when company policy, not just peer comparison, codifies AI fluency as the new floor.

## When urgency turns into mandate

Pressure stops being ambient when it’s written into a policy document. On 7 April 2025, Shopify’s CEO Tobi Lütke emailed staff [a now-famous directive](https://x.com/tobi/status/1909251946235437514): before any team requests extra head-count, it must prove the work “cannot be done with AI.” What had lurked as an unspoken expectation— *of course you’re automating* —became a formal gating criterion. One memo, and reflexive AI use moved from competitive edge to company standard.

The ripple was immediate. Other firms, unwilling to look complacent, quietly drafted similar language for annual planning decks and job descriptions. The message was clear: fluency is no longer bonus mileage; it’s the price of admission. Where early adopters once earned kudos, late adopters now risk corrective action plans.

Mandates alter the emotional math. Until now, falling behind carried reputational sting; after a policy shift, it carries procedural consequences—approval bottlenecks, tighter performance reviews, stalled promotions. The Red Queen race grows teeth. Employees who were jogging anxiously must decide whether to sprint or step off the track entirely. Some double down on upskilling; others seek roles in smaller companies without hard AI quotas, creating a new talent migration pattern—but this feels perilous in a world where companies are rapidly adopting AI as a competitive advantage. The company you jump to may impose an AI mandate shortly, because companies themselves are engaged in a Red Queen race.

## Naming what is happening

Look, this entire substack is dedicated to making it easier for you to keep up. There will be lots more tips to come in future posts. But I think it’s worthwhile to take a moment occasionally to name what is happening within many of us as well—to remind you you’re not alone.

First, there is grief—quiet, hard to admit, and easy to mislabel as simple frustration. The familiar landscape of your craft is morphing so quickly you barely have time to wave goodbye to what you once mastered. Psychologists call this *anticipatory loss*: the sorrow that something precious—your routine, your hard-won competence, perhaps even a piece of your professional identity—is slipping away before you can properly mourn it. You are not being dramatic; you are reacting like any human who senses erosion at the foundations of expertise.

Next comes the gulf between promise and lived reality. Headlines shout “2× productivity with AI,” but they edit out the hours spent coaxing models, debugging odd edge cases, and second-guessing whether the gleaming output is actually correct. The marketing sizzle is all upside; the cognitive bill arrives later, payable in decision fatigue and low-grade anxiety. Living in that gap can feel like standing on a moving walkway that refuses to match your stride.

Then there is the backstage-versus-highlight-reel effect. When colleagues demo their polished workflows, you witness the final cut—smooth commands, instant graphs, neat takeaways. What you don’t see are their discarded drafts and midnight misfires. Meanwhile you’re painfully aware of every blooper in your own process: the prompts that looped, the data that mis-formatted, the afternoon lost to a stubborn API limit. It is easy to assume their ease is innate and your stumbles are unique, when in truth everyone is editing out the messy middle.

Hold that collage of emotions for a moment. **None of it points to laziness, inefficiency, or lack of talent.** It simply reflects a treadmill that genuinely has sped up beneath all of us. Naming the feelings does not slow the belt, but it allows you to loosen the white-knuckle grip, breathe, and remember that the dizziness is shared—evidence of a system in overdrive, not of individual inadequacy.
