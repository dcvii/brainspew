_**What can people who value life do in the face of those who worship Death?” This is the urgent question at the heart of a vital new book, [On Democracies and Death Cults](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780063437135), by a dear friend of The Free Press: Douglas Murray.**_

_**If you’re reading this, you probably care about freedom. The freedom to speak your mind. To vote in elections. To host dinner parties and argue about politics and perhaps even fall in love. But are you willing to defend your right to do these things? What would you be willing to sacrifice for those freedoms?**_

_**Another way of asking that question is: If war came, would the West defend itself?**_

_**Douglas used to be pessimistic about this question. Then came [October 7, 2023](https://www.thefp.com/p/october-7-a-year-of-free-press-stories). He was at home in New York when he heard the news that Israel—a country he had visited many times, and where he had many beloved friends—had been invaded by terrorists. The next day, in Times Square, Americans gathered to protest not the terrorists but the [democracy under attack](https://www.timesofisrael.com/pro-palestinians-celebrate-hamas-attack-as-israel-supporters-rally-in-new-york/). Douglas decided he needed to fly, as soon as possible, to Tel Aviv—a place where moral clarity still seemed to exist. And in the months that followed, as the war ground on, he returned to Israel many times to cover the conflict. He met the young soldiers defending the nation from Hamas and Hezbollah. He spent time with the pathologists identifying the bodies of the Israelis murdered on October 7, and he came face-to-face with those who survived—as well as with some of the terrorists, now prisoners, who committed the atrocities.**_

_**[On Democracies and Death Cults](https://amzn.to/4iU4zIs), which is out April 8, is an account of Douglas’s time in Israel during the first year of the war, and we’re so honored to publish an excerpt today. In the following piece, Douglas reflects on witnessing both the very best and very worst of humanity.**_

_**In his book’s epigraph, Douglas quotes the Soviet dissident [Vasily Grossman](https://www.historynet.com/terrible-truth-defense-stalingrad/), who recorded atrocities in the USSR that the authorities would have preferred to cover up: “Someone might ask: ‘Why write about this, why remember all that?’ It is the writer’s duty to tell this terrible truth, and it is the civilian duty of the reader to learn it.” As readers ourselves, we take that duty seriously. —The Editors**_

War heightens every human emotion. It is easier to hate in wartime, obviously. But it is also easier to love. The usual expectation that we will die in our eighth or ninth decade, quietly in our beds, is stripped away—and when you are forced to wonder whether you will live to see tomorrow, everything today is different.

This is one of the things that makes war so fascinating: It reveals the meaning of things.

In the days after the war began, I joined the Israeli pathologists who were working on identifying the bodies in the morgues. Bags were still being brought in, but with less and less in them: Many victims were being identified by bits of the mobile phones or other things on their bodies that had not burned fully. One of the skulls that had been put back together was small. Surely this was a child’s skull, I said. Possibly, replied the expert, but it could also be the head of a young adult that had simply contracted in the fire.

These pathologists went about their task with unbelievable care, but I couldn’t describe the sadness in their eyes. Nor the smell everywhere. If the thing you cannot describe about a war zone is the noise, what cannot be communicated about the aftermath of a massacre is the smell.

I sometimes asked these people how they cope with their job. And the answer, of course, is that they are used to it. But one of them confided that there was something he was finding especially hard in the wake of the 7th: Many of the bodies, particularly the burned bodies of family members, had been tied together. These people must have known what was coming. “The knowledge that you are going to die,” one pathologist said to me, shaking his head, “that is very difficult.”

​​What can Western liberal societies do in the face of such an atrocity? What can people who value life do in the face of those who worship Death?

In the year that followed, as I reported on the war, two lines kept going through my head. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, given I was in the Holy Land, they were both lines from Scripture.

First was from Deuteronomy, where God says: “I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that thou and thy seed may live.”

The second was from the Book of Psalms, and it is this: “I shall not die, but live.”

One evening, late into the night, I went to see a family who lives in the town of Barkan, in Samaria. The father was a local official, and he, his wife, and his teenage son were all still up as though night and day no longer mattered. The house was filled with photos of his beautiful daughter.

Twenty-three-year-old Adi Baruch was an aspiring photographer. She especially liked to photograph sunflowers, because she appreciated how, whatever the time of day, they turn their faces toward the sun. She was a reservist on October 7 and didn’t need to go back into the army—in fact, her parents pleaded with her not to. But she knew she had a job to do.

On her first day back in uniform, October 12, she was in Sderot, close to Gaza. Hamas was still firing rockets. When the sirens went off, she got out of her car and lay on the ground beside it, but one of the rockets landed right alongside her, killing her instantly. Her mother described it all in terrible detail, but one thing comforted her, she said: The blast that killed Adi had also left her untouched. “She looked like she was just sleeping. Like an angel,” her mother told me.

They buried Adi three days later, and after the ceremony, her fiancé approached the coffin alone and left on top of it a small, white box. Inside was the engagement ring he had bought for her.

Before going back into the army, Adi had written her parents a letter. It was to be read in the eventuality of her death. Her mother read it to me now. Among much else, Adi had written to her parents to tell them how sorry she was, but toward the end she told them: “I wanted to live life, and now I want you to live it for me.”

I thought of all the other people who wanted to live. Of Ben Shimoni, who was at the Nova party. His girlfriend, Jessica Miranda Elter, had called him that morning begging him to come home. “Something is happening, come back.”

“Yes, yes,” he had tried to reassure her. “I’ll come back, don’t worry.”

Ben managed to escape the party, taking four other terrified partygoers with him in his car. He drove them to safety in Beersheba, about 30 minutes away. Then, he headed back to the site of the party. He managed to drive another group of five young people to safety. His passengers begged him not to go back into the firefight. But he had a mission. On the third trip, as Ben carried three more survivors in his car, the terrorists caught up. They riddled the car with bullets until it crashed into another car, killing everyone.

I think also of Omer Ohana and Sagi Golan. When they woke up on the morning of the 7th, just two weeks before they were due to marry, both men were ready to serve. Omer was sent to the north and Sagi to the south. They agreed that they would send each other a heart on WhatsApp every hour to let the other know they were okay. Thirty-year-old Sagi fought with his anti-terrorism unit in Kibbutz Be’eri, among other sites, and saved many lives that day. “On midnight, I got the last heart from Sagi,” said Omer. His fiancé was killed shortly afterward in the ongoing battle in Be’eri.

The Israeli singer Ivri Lider, whose music Omer and Sagi planned to dance to at their wedding, instead performed the song they had chosen at Sagi’s funeral.

From the moment the massacre began, I decided that I wanted to see some of the terrorists face-to-face: to look into the eyes of the people who had been so high on the thrill of death, as they brought it on men, women, and children that morning.

Eventually, in April 2024, I got permission to visit one of the world’s most secure prisons. The facility, at an undisclosed location, held some of the most dedicated and murderous people who had broken into Israel the day of the massacre and been caught alive. It was made clear to me that, however defeated they looked now, these were people who had done the most unimaginable things when they were in a position of power just a few months before.

The director of the prison showed me a video on his phone. I had already seen the footage from Netiv HaAsara, where the Taasa family lived. I saw it shortly after the 7th. It was even harder to watch and hear the second time around.

The Taasa family’s eldest son, who was 17, was on the beach when the terrorists came. He was shot dead. Shortly afterward, Hamas found their way to the Taasa family’s home. Hearing them coming, the father, Gil, ran into a bomb shelter with his two young sons. Security cameras captured the moment when one of the terrorists threw a grenade into the bomb shelter. Gil threw himself on the grenade to save his young sons. Still, the youngest, who was 8, had an eye blown out of its socket by the blast. The elder, who was 12, seemed to lose his hearing. Footage from inside the family house shows the boys clambering out of the shelter and staggering around the living room in their underwear.

Then one of the terrorists—who had just killed their father—calmly walks into the room with an AK-47 around his shoulders. He takes away the older boy’s phone and insists he speak to him in Arabic. (“What? I don’t know,” the boy replies. “Please, please, let me go home. Call mama, my mum. Please. Where’s my dad, my dad?”) Eventually, another terrorist comes into the room, opens the family’s fridge in front of the boys, removes a bottle of the family’s Coca-Cola, and calmly walks away, drinking it.

Now, one of the terrorists who committed this atrocity was only a few feet away from me in the prison.

I suppose that you look at people like this in the hope that you might see something in them. Remorse? Evil? I spent hours in the prison that day, and although I saw people I recognized from videos of the atrocities that took place on October 7, there was nothing to learn from them.

In one of the cells, I recognized someone who had become notorious in Israel since the 7th: a young Hamas terrorist with distinctive, bright ginger hair. Footage shows him entering the Nova party with guns and grenades; evidence suggests he killed as many as 30 or 40 young people at the party that morning. And here he was in front of me, looking no different from any other person of his age. He didn’t look evil—only pathetic.

The men I saw that day had decided to live their lives with one ambition—to take away life.

A few months later, I got a more intimate view of terror.

In October 2024, I was with my cameraman Moshe, on our way north to the Lebanon border, when he got an alert on his [Hatzalah device](https://hatzalah.org/). Something was happening in the city of Hadera. We happened to be exactly at the interchange and we drove right into the situation.

It seemed that a terrorist had gone on a stabbing spree in the city. We arrived in time to find one of the first victims bleeding out in the doorway of his house. He had several knife wounds to his rib cage and was rolling on the floor. Moshe and another first responder tried to apply pressure to the wounds and stem the bleeding. We didn’t know where the attacker was, but there was blood all over the street and floor around us. Occasionally, people peered out from their front doors and then locked them shut again fast. Everyone knew that the terrorists were hiding somewhere around us—but where?

There was word that two of them had driven off on a scooter. Locals shouted that the attacker or attackers were heading to the local school. By now the police were on the scene, along with an ambulance. The man we had tended to was wheeled away, a look of extreme pain, as well as amazement, on his face. He died shortly afterward. It turned out that he was a 35-year-old rabbi, and the father of six children.

Meanwhile, the police managed to handcuff someone they thought was an accomplice of the terrorist. The young Arab man was arrested a few feet away from me, and for a moment we looked directly at each other. There was an expression of complete resignation on his face, as though all this was exactly as he expected.

For my own part, I was overcome with a single feeling: What a stupid, stupid thing to do with your life. Of all the things you could have done on this earth, why do this? Don’t you know what a waste you have just made of your life?

By this point, there were alerts going off everywhere. We got to an intersection just after another victim had been attacked. Blood covered the middle of the road, and as panicked locals drove their cars to get away, first aid bandages were ground into the tarmac. Eventually the police found the terrorist, standing at the end of an alley. He refused to take off his visor mask or his padded jacket, and in a moment, when it looked like he was about to reach for a weapon, he was shot and fell to the floor. It was a situation both surreal and ordinary, the sort of thing that happens in a country at war.

Throughout this year of war, friends and family occasionally remarked that I had changed. Readers sometimes noticed it too, observing that I seemed to have lost some of my usual pessimism. I noticed it myself, and there was a reason for it. I was getting an answer to a question that had always troubled me.

Like most people of my background, I grew up with family stories of those who went away to war in 1914, and those who went to war again in 1939. On my father’s side alone, my grandmother lost her father at sea in World War I and her brother, also in the navy, in the 1940s. The fight against tyranny had been real. And all the generations who have come after have asked themselves: _What would we do if our time came?_

At one point in the early months of the conflict, I was in a street in Tel Aviv and a taxi driver recognized me. We started talking, and I learned that he was a veteran of the wars of 1967 and 1973. Then he said something that made my eyes prick: “I owe the younger generation an apology.” I was startled, but he continued. “I thought they had become weak,” he said. “I thought they just wanted to party in Tel Aviv or be on TikTok or Instagram. But I was wrong. They have stepped up. They are magnificent.”

Everything I saw in the wars around us confirmed this. I thought of all the heroes—all the young men and women who were just like the people I knew outside of Israel, but who were having to do things these people couldn’t imagine. Other young people, at institutions across the West, were judging the actions of their contemporaries in Israel. They were throwing slur after slur at them and reigniting every blood libel of the past in a modern guise. They should have looked at their contemporaries in Israel not as scapegoats but as an example. Whatever the years ahead hold for the West, I know that Canada, Britain, Europe, Australia, and America should be so lucky as to produce a generation of young people like the one Israel has.

During that year of war, I also realized that I had found the answer to a question I had mulled over for almost a quarter of a century. All my adult life I had heard the taunt of the jihadists: “We love death more than you love life.” I had heard it from al-Qaeda, from Hamas, from ISIS. From Europe to Afghanistan, several of my friends and colleagues had heard such war cries in their last moments. And it had always seemed to me almost impossible to counter. How could anyone overcome a movement—a people—who welcomed death, who gloried in death, who worshiped death? Was it not inevitable that against such a force, a feeble and sybaritic West could not possibly win?

That is what I feared for many years. Yet in the year after the October 7 attacks, what I saw was hope. Of all the Israeli soldiers I met, none took delight in their task. They could feel victorious on occasion, proud to have completed a mission and gotten their unit out alive. But from the south of Gaza to the south of Lebanon and the West Bank, none took pleasure in the task they had to do. They did it not because they loved death but exactly because they love life. They fought for life. For the survival of their families, their nation, and their people. Even the most secular of them knew that the lifestyle most of us take for granted must be protected. They know that you won’t have the ability to party, fall in love, grow a family, or live a meaningful life unless they are willing to fight for it.

In the year after the October 7 attacks I went to weddings and bar mitzvahs and funerals in Israel. Sometimes on the same day. I heard tales of unbelievable suffering, but I also saw people grab for the light in the darkness. “Choose life” is one of the most important commandments of the Jewish people. It is also one of the fundamental values of the West. Israelis, and all of us, can win, in spite of the enemy loving death—and that is because they love life so much.

A final word, from a 50-year-old man named Avida Bachar, whom I met at one of the recovery units in Ramat Gan. He told me about watching his wife and son die in front of him in their safe room, in Be’eri, on October 7. But even through his tears, he still wanted to draw some light from it. He had had 32 years with his wife, he said, and he had had the good fortune to have 15 years with his son. And this was what mattered.

“All of us,” he said. “All of us, we think that the time is going on until the end. But the time, it’s really short. And I told my friends at work, there’s no meeting after four o’clock in the afternoon. We’re not going to stay at work. We go home to our friends and family to make a good time, and good memories. What we have, it’s only people.”

He promised me he would be okay.
