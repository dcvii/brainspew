When I visit Costco I try to absorb the atmosphere as if I created everything; cruising the Costco isles I can take on a God-the-Creator perspective: I do take it all in: the people, the shrink-wrapped stuff, everything. I survey my creation and pronounce it “Good.” The variety of people is nearly overwhelming: the nine foot tall Viking with a wooden leg, the Filipina grandmother wearing tights, a fringe buckskin jacket, rhinestone go-go boots, hands laden with jewelry, the Mexican mom, the Indian mom, the white mom, the east African mom, the Muslim mom and their trailing broods. Everyone seems so happy; they wait in line with great patience, no fights break out, and the Costco staff are all smiling and helpful; even the guys at the back loading dock (where I usually park) seem to be singing for joy.

I still can’t get over Peter Strzok’s email to Lisa page - the one where he wrote about ‘smelling all the Trump supporters’ at Wal-Mart. So hurtful. So small. So evil. Wal-Mart isn’t exactly Costco but the idea applies: human beings taking care of business within God’s great bounty. If you can’t take joy in seeing others satisfying their wants and needs, there might be something wrong with you. There aren’t that many pubic spaces where you find human beings are at their best.

At Costco I look at the crowds, I look up to the third tier of shrink-wrapped goods and say to myself, “Praise God.” I feel I’ve walked into one of those beautiful Psalms that are all praise and rejoicing. Yes, God is full of mystery but sometimes you find yourself wrapped in His creation and you find yourself agreeing with him: “Yes, it is good.”
