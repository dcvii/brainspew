## MotherDuck Dives: From Ad Hoc Questions to Real-Time Answers

Hosted by MotherDuck

About Event

You know the pattern: someone asks a quick question, you write a query, share the results. A week later, new question. Are we really going to build a thousand nes dashboards this quarter??  
  
We built something to fix that. Dives are interactive visualizations that your AI agent builds directly in MotherDuck - ask a question in natural language, get a live chart backed by your actual data. Filter, drill down, and share it. Dives are for the long-tail of data questions, the kind everyone wants answered but nobody wants to build a dashboard for.

Join us to see how Dives work, how they fit into local-first workflows, and what it looks like to use Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor as your agent through the MotherDuck MCP Server.
