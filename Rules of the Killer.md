# Rules of the Killer

- Redundancy
- Stick to the Plan
- Anticipate. Don't Improvise
- Trust No One
- Fight only the Battle You are Paid to Fight
- Every Step. Ask what's in it for me
- Keep Calm. Keep moving
- Vigilance is Essential

This is what it takes if you want to succeed.
The only life path is the one behind you.
Forbid empathy. Empathy is Weakness. Weakness is Vulnerability.
