## SR-22 vs SR-1P

August 11, 2019

To understand the difference between SR22 and SR1P. Let’s look at what each one means first.

## SR-22

This is a form that is filed by the insurance company as proof that the individual has insurance.

Unlike when insuring a vehicle and the insurance follows the vehicle. The SR-22 follows the driver and is attached usually to their driver’s license.

Most drivers who need an SR-22 filing usually have a suspended license the California DMV requires them to have an SR-22 filing for period of time(often 3 years).

Most common reason drivers have their license suspended is because of a DUI, but there can be other reasons like “reckless driving” or getting into an accident without automobile insurance.

## SR-1P

An SR-1P is a form that is provided by the insurance company when the policyholder has gotten into an car accident and needs to prove financial responsibility, or simply that the driver had insurance at the time of the accident.

If the driver did not have insurance at the time of the car accident the California DMV may require the driver to get an SR-22 to get their license back.
