[Why are politicians talking about how women are paid less than men for the same work, when this is not true?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-politicians-talking-about-how-women-are-paid-less-than-men-for-the-same-work-when-this-is-not-true?no_redirect=1)

This question previously had details. They are now in a comment.

Because the way you've set out the problem is a massively over-simplistic understanding of the gender pay gap and sexism in general. Let me correct that, before very briefly actually answering your question.

There are broadly two issues here. The first is women being paid less than men for doing exactly the same job, and the second is women having less opportunities for higher paying positions. The second, in the west, is more prevalent than the first, partially thanks to laws that are intended to equalize male and female pay.

The first is what you refer to when you say 'Obviously this is false or companies would only hire women to improve profit margins and lower operating cost'. However, what you're missing is that the reason women get paid less in these cases is because they are perceived as being lower quality workers. Where these sexist hiring practices exist, they still hire men for more money because they believe the men are worth the extra they're paying. From their perspective, it's not a case that you have two equal choices but one is cheaper than the other, it's that you have two options: a cheap and crap one and a more expensive but good one. They're prepared to pay a premium on what they perceive as a better resource.

This, fortunately, is much less of a problem than it used to be due to equality laws. Where it is still a problem and can be exposed, there are legal avenues to challenge it.

The second is more complicated and a much larger problem, and comes from a variety of social pressures. A very brief summary follows:

- Women are expected to be the primary care givers of children in their early years

This makes them more likely to take long career breaks and makes them more likely to be part time workers. This slows their career advancement compared to men, meaning they get paid less. This even affects women who don't have children, because there's a lingering fear they might have children so they're not as worth developing or promoting.

"But, Matt, isn't that just the natural order of things? Are women not destined to stay at home with the children? How can any other situation be imagined?"

Well, despite what others seem to be suggesting, no. I mean, it's a perfectly legitimate choice for a woman to choose to be the primary caregiver, but there's no particular reason that a man, in the modern western world, can't be a stay at home dad for the first few months or years of the child's life while the woman goes and works. Obviously some time off is required to give birth and recover, but far less than the usual 6 months to a year.

Except, actually, there is a reason that couples don't have this choice (though is has nothing to do with women being innately maternal while men are better at making money). It's because women get very long maternity leave and legal protection of that time, while men get like 5 minutes. This is along with a large amount of societal pressure for the woman to stay at home. The UK is starting to improve this, as men and women can share the second half of the maternity leave, but there's still some way to go to make this at all normal or a choice that wouldn't raise eyebrows.

- Many professions still have some level of gendering where there is no actual basis for this

Prime examples include the physical sciences or investment banking. There is a general belief, be it overt or covert, that science and maths are for little boys and cooking and teaching and care-giving are for little girls.

"But, Matt, aren't women in this progressive and modern western world free to make choices about their own careers? They could choose to go into investment banking if they wanted, but they're just not as good at it as men, and they know their place!"

Yeah, no. Part of the problem is that the pressure starts from an early age, where boys are encouraged more in school at maths and sciences than girls. Quoting PISA 2012 key findings on gender equality ([Page on oecd.org](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-volume-II.pdf "www.oecd.org")):

> The report also reveals worrying gender differences in students’ attitudes towards mathematics: even when girls perform as well as boys in mathematics, they report less perseverance, less motivation to learn mathematics, less belief in their own mathematics skills, and higher levels of anxiety about mathematics. While the average girl underperforms in mathematics compared with the average boy, the gender gap in favour of boys is even wider among the highest-achieving students. These findings have serious implications not only for higher education, where young women are already underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields of study, but also later on, when these young women enter the labour market. This confirms the findings of the OECD Gender Strategy, which identifies some of the factors that create – and widen – the gender gap in education, labour and entrepreneurship. Supporting girls’ positive attitudes towards and investment in learning mathematics will go a long way towards narrowing this gap.

  
To summarise this briefly, women believe they're not as good at maths as men even when they are.

This comes from a long line of being told this in various subtle (and often well meaning) ways, and doesn't stop when they leave school. This almost doesn't just apply for maths, but other male dominated fields too. However, STEM based fields are often the highest earning and the ones which women are most excluded from.

I also want to be clear that women aren't just easily manipulated idiots here; men are also highly subjected to societal pressures, it just doesn't tend to hit them in the pay packet or generally disenfranchise them in the same ways.

- Fields that have historically always been male dominated are harder for women to break into

Again, one that heavily applies to STEM professions. People hire people like themselves. There is a great deal of research on this, and it's hard to combat. Heavily male dominated workplaces also tend to be less welcoming to women (equally true the other way around). There's a reason many of these professions are known as 'boys clubs'. It's harder for women to get and keep jobs, and be happy in jobs, where they are a tiny minority.

Right, so to actually answer your question:

The reason politicians are talking about this is because there's still a long way to go before we have employment equality and equality of opportunity between men and women. The gender pay gap is a bit of a crude way to measure this, and isn't flawless, but it's not the real issue. The real issues are the ones that create it, and that lie underneath it. It's the way that women are pushed out of their careers and the sciences and coerced to fill particular societal roles whether or not that's actually what they want. The real issue is about the limitation of choice and freedom for women.

That's why politicians are talking about how women are paid less than men.

Thank you, so very, very much. I was despairing of having to parse all this out and explain it, and you fulfilled all the points I would have. Thank you. I've been seeing a lot about "what men can do about sexism" lately, and yours is the very first example I can think of that features it in action. …

No problem, and I hope I captured at least most of the main issues. After seeing some of the other answers and comments, it certainly does seem like there quite a few who do think there's a level playing field, so hopefully this will be useful to at least someone.[M.

Women as a group are more “maternal” only in that it is from the word for “mother”. (Maybe you’ve forgotten your first-year Latin?) But as far as meaning women are more “natural” at childcare is hooey. Caring for an infant must be entirely learned. Look at what happens when it’s assumed that it is “i…

What nonsense! Women actually have (give birth to) children, men do not. It is inbuilt with women to care for their children. You would have to be blind and deaf to not recognise this most basic biological imperative.Yes some women do need to be taught how to nurse their children. But only because in our modern society we hide this away, they don’t see other women doing it as they normally would have seen in smaller tribes, early in our history, when breastfeeding was done quite openly. That’s very easy for anyone to understand I’m sure.
