LONDON—In recent days, King Charles III moved [decisively to shut down](https://www.wsj.com/world/uk/prince-andrew-stripped-of-royal-title-by-king-charles-a1afe915?mod=article_inline) a slow-burning scandal that threatened to tarnish not only his reign but that of his son Prince William.

For over a decade, the former friendship between Charles’ younger brother Andrew with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein generated negative headlines, embarrassing the royal family. Andrew had [long denied he abused](https://www.wsj.com/world/uk/shadow-of-prince-andrew-scandal-looms-over-buckingham-palace-11642178355?mod=article_inline) an American teenage girl introduced to him by Epstein decades ago, but a drumbeat of fresh disclosures in recent weeks brought the scandal back to Britain’s front pages, sparking fresh public disapproval and complaints from lawmakers about the man 8th in line to the throne.

After several days of negotiations, Charles and his brother finally agreed on terms Thursday afternoon, according to royal aides, and within hours the news was made public: Prince Andrew would be stripped of his royal status and relegated to simply Mr. Mountbatten Windsor. He would also lose the mansion where he lived and paid no rent. In exchange, Charles would pay for his brother to live in a far more modest house on the family’s holiday estate of Sandringham.

Despite the move, the debacle is likely to hang over the family for years to come. There has always been salacious gossip about the royal family, and misbehaving royals, but this time it felt much worse.

“I don’t remember a scandal like this,” says Ingrid Seward, editor in chief of Majesty magazine. “It’s not going to make it go away, the more people talk about it the more people get involved,” Seward said, adding the last time the monarchy was hit with this level of turmoil was when Charles divorced his first wife, Diana.

The demotion could, however, take the oxygen out of those who criticize the palace for being too lenient in their treatment of Andrew, royal watchers say. “I’m not sure it will completely satisfy the public disquiet but it’s at least something,” Andrew Lownie, the historian and author of “Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York,” told the BBC.

Traditionally, the royal family has a policy of not complaining or explaining when faced with scandal. For years a mixture of protocol and family ties made the monarchy reluctant to fully swing the ax on Andrew, royal experts say. The dashing former helicopter pilot was widely considered his mother’s favorite son and courtiers said Queen Elizabeth II didn’t want to take steps to fully humiliate him. Stripping royal titles was something reserved for those who committed near treasonable offenses or no longer considered part of the extended royal clan.

This position changed after Charles came to the throne. The monarch, who is 76 and continues to fight cancer, is expected to have a relatively short reign during which his main legacy is to bequeath a monarchy on a strong footing to his popular son Prince William, who has long urged the palace to take more decisive action against his disgraced uncle.

It is uncertain what life now awaits Andrew. He is expected to leave his 30-room mansion on the Windsor Estate in the coming months. He has lived there with his ex wife Sarah Ferguson, but she won’t be joining him at Sandringham, leaving her to fend for herself.

The windswept rural Sandringham Estate is a far cry from Windsor, which is close to London. It remains to be seen whether Andrew, who is used to having a full staff and valet, will now be expected to cook his own meals. The palace has simply said that the king will provide for his brother from his private funds.

Two recent events made Andrew’s position untenable. His accuser Virginia Giuffre [died by suicide this year](https://www.wsj.com/world/prominent-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-virginia-giuffre-dies-her-family-says-39d00f4e?mod=article_inline), and has posthumously published a memoir in recent weeks detailing how Andrew allegedly had sex with her on three separate occasions, including during an orgy with Epstein. The book was filled with tawdry details, such as an anecdote about how Andrew licked the arches of her feet and shared a bath with her. Secondly, the British press published emails that showed Andrew was emailing Epstein in 2011, well after the royal had claimed he had cut ties with him.

Prince Andrew’s slow relegation from the House of Windsor began in earnest six years ago. In 2019, Andrew conducted a disastrous interview with the BBC in which he tried to justify his visits to Jeffrey Epstein’s house, well after the U.S. financier was convicted of sex crimes. During one exchange, Andrew said he had no recollection of meeting Giuffre, claiming he had been at a pizza restaurant when an alleged assault took place. The interview painted a picture of an entitled royal who was aloof and arrogant.

A few weeks later, the then-Prince Charles confronted his younger brother at Queen Elizabeth’s country retreat in Sandringham. Charles told Andrew he should rapidly exit the public stage or risk the future royal roles of his daughters, according to a person familiar with the meeting.

But Andrew didn’t go quietly. He began a public relations battle with the U.S. Justice Department, which was probing the allegations of abuse by Epstein. In 2022 Andrew settled a civil sexual abuse case with Giuffre without admitting guilt. He remained in Royal Lodge on the Windsor Estate, despite entreaties by Charles that he move to somewhere less lavish. And despite being relegated to a status of “non-working royal” he continued to turn up to events.

Andrew, who is 12 years younger than Charles, was long considered the family’s amiable cad. At school he got the moniker “Randy Andy” after he said he was found in the girl’s boardinghouse. His turn as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands War cast him in the role of war hero, and his televised marriage to Sarah Ferguson in 1986 drew an audience of millions.

In 2001, Andrew was appointed in an ambassadorial role as the U.K.’s special trade representative. But whispers of scandal became louder as the years passed for the former Duke of York, who developed a reputation for both the ladies and using his rank and title for personal gain. He faced growing questions about links to politicians in countries like Azerbaijan and Libya.

In 2007, he sold a house given to him by Queen Elizabeth II to the son-in-law of the then-president of Kazakhstan, who reportedly paid £3 million pounds over the asking price. He traveled far and wide on taxpayer money, reportedly working to represent companies seeking contracts in countries like Kazakhstan.

A former British diplomat said Andrew was jokingly called “His Buffoon Highness” by members of the diplomatic corps in the Middle East. A U.S. ambassador to the region called him “rude” and “cocky” in a diplomatic cable later revealed by WikiLeaks.

In 2011, Andew stepped down from the role of trade representative after the publication of a photo of Andrew with his arm around Giuffre. His ex-wife Ferguson, whom he continued to live with despite divorcing in 1996, was also a source of embarrassment. She was caught in a tabloid sting agreeing to sell access to Andrew for £500,000 and also accepted money from Epstein to pay off debts to a former employee.

Despite stepping back from royal duties, Andrew continued to be a liability. MI5, the U.K.’s domestic spy agency, said that Chinese authorities dispatched a Chinese businessman to cultivate a relationship with the down-and-out prince in a bid to promote the interest of the Communist Party. The businessman was later banned from entering the U.K.; Andrew said that nothing of a sensitive nature was discussed with him.

Ultimately, the Epstein scandal refused to die for him or his ex-wife. In 2011, the duchess said in a media interview that her involvement with Epstein had been a “gigantic error of judgment.” But this year it was disclosed she sent an email to Epstein weeks later apologizing for bad mouthing him and referring to him as her “supreme friend.” Ferguson said she had sent the email following a threat from Epstein.

Other emails were also published between Andrew and Epstein, dating to 2011, just after when the image of his arm around Giuffre was first made public in the press.

“Keep in close touch,” the then-prince wrote Epstein in 2011. “and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”.
