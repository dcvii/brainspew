[AI assistants](https://lumo.proton.me/) give businesses an edge, helping teams work smarter and save time. But Big Tech AI services come with risky baggage. They log your organization’s data, can share it with third parties, and can leak it to governments and hackers.

Not Lumo.

Lumo is the only AI that gives you all the advantages and without the privacy risks. Millions of individuals are already using our AI assistant to find answers, draft documents, and get more done. Now we’re bringing that same power to organizations with [Lumo for Business](https://lumo.proton.me/business).

**Lumo for Business is a new plan that enables your whole workforce to be secure, compliant, and productive with powerful AI.** Unlike other AI services that require expensive enterprise plans, Lumo is affordable for teams of any size with no minimums.

## Boost productivity and stay in control

With Lumo for Business, you get the benefits of AI without giving up control over your business data. It’s perfect for companies that have a strict need for confidentiality, like financial advisers, law firms or tech companies with a lot of Intellectual Property.

Here’s what you can do with Lumo:

### Protect your business data

Lumo never keeps a record of your conversations, and your team members’ chat histories are stored with zero-access encryption. That means that a given user’s chats can only be decrypted on that same user’s devices using that person’s password. Since we don’t keep a record of your chats, we also can’t share them with any third parties or leak them.

**Everything you say to Lumo, whether it’s your intellectual property or information about your clients, is entirely under your control and only accessible to you.**

### Get more done

You can use Lumo to analyze datasets, summarize meeting notes, draft documents, and plan brainstorms more efficiently. Lumo integrates with [Proton Drive](https://proton.me/drive), so you can easily add PDFs or [Docs](https://proton.me/drive/docs) to your conversations for more context and better responses.

### Stay compliant, and protected by European privacy law

Because Lumo is hosted entirely in Europe, your data benefits from some of the world’s strongest privacy protections. Lumo is also GDPR compliant by design, so we are legally prevented from abusing your data. By contrast, US-based AI services retain logs for their own use and can be compelled to [hand over chats to the government](https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance). If AI is not based in a privacy-friendly jurisdiction, it is not truly confidential. The primary owner of Lumo is the nonprofit Proton Foundation based in Geneva, Switzerland.

### Trust your AI software

Big Tech AI doesn’t show you the code you’re bringing into your business. Once again, Lumo does things differently. Our codebase is open source, so anyone can trust and verify our apps are secure and do exactly what we claim. You can explore our [iOS](https://github.com/ProtonLumo/ios-lumo), [Android](https://github.com/ProtonLumo/android-lumo), and [web app](https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients/tree/main/applications/lumo) code. We also only use open-source models, which gives you peace of mind that the training data, methods, and model weights have been vetted by the public.

## Getting started is simple

Privacy and security tools should be easy enough for anyone to use. And that includes professional software. To get started, your team can simply download the apps for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumo-by-proton/id6746714949) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.proton.android.lumo). There’s nothing you need to integrate — no IT required.

With Lumo for Business, you get access to our most advanced models, the fastest responses, and unlimited responses. And you’ll be among the first to get new features as we release them.

More than 100 million people already trust Proton Mail, Proton VPN, Proton Pass, and Proton Drive to protect their most sensitive information. Lumo for Business extends that same protection to AI, so your business can embrace new technology without giving up control over your data.
