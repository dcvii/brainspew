Hi there. Welcome to another DishCast from Provincetown. I'm not leaving. They're not dragging me out of here yet. This is what they call towny summer, which is when all the ghastly tourists leave and those of us who live here, at least for parts of the year, get to enjoy it all for ourselves. It's also kind of,

it gets to be a little depressing this period because things slowly shut down. You get a sense of the whole thing dying in front of you. So it's mixed feelings, but I've had a wonderful break. And one of the fun things I've been doing is reading. I want to let you know, first of all, please,

if you haven't subscribed to the Weekly Dish, now is your chance to do so. If you don't or haven't, for some absurd reason, this conversation will peter out after about an hour. And you won't get all the juicy bits we always save till the end. Just kidding.

And we have a pretty stellar cast of upcoming guests about some pretty fun issues. We have Karen Howe is coming on to talk about AI. We have Katie Herzog coming on to discuss her book, Drinking Your Way Sober. We have Charles Murray coming on, talking about religion and why he has, in his later years,

come to see its efficacy, despite his long time as an atheist. Michael Wolff We're going to get all Epstein-y on Michael Wolff because we've been putting this off that topic. And the Epstein stuff is – I mean, I just read and looked through this book.

It's genuinely – you feel like you want to take a shower after you've read this thing. It's just too foul for words. And John Ellis – who writes a fantastic Substack, probably has the best update on all the kind of news you miss and don't see in the MSM.

And we're also going to talk to some length about the mental health of the President of the United States, which I have long worried about, as you know. But today, a book I really found fascinating and interesting over the break. Jill Lepore is a writer and a scholar. She's a professor of American history at Harvard University.

professor of law at Harvard Law School, staff writer since 2005 for The New Yorker. She's also the host of the podcast X-Man, the Elon Musk origin story, and her many books include These Truths, The History of the United States, which I reviewed in The New York Times, and her new one, which we're going to discuss today,

We the People, A History of the U.S. Constitution. Jill, thank you so much for sharing this time with us.

Oh, thanks so much for having me. What a delight.

Oh, well, our listeners are among the sharpest online, so beware. But tell us where you were born and what your parents did for a living.

I was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, and my parents were both public school teachers.

Worcester. Worcester. What did they teach and how did that affect you?

My dad started out, my dad was the first person in his family born in the United States, Italian-American family, and fought in the Second World War as a very young man, went to college on the GI Bill, hitchhiked to school in Worcester, and then taught Italian and Spanish for a while, taught English, tried to be a writer.

He was a big devotee of Ernest Hemingway.

Oh, yeah?

For the whole of his life. Really?

Yeah.

He was then, I think, a middle school principal at the time he met my mother. He hired her to be the school's art teacher in August of 1955, and they were married in June of 1956. Wow. He kept, she kept, he used to... Leave these notes in the teacher's room in the mailbox, which she kept,

and some of which were quite filthy from a 1950s vantage to Catholics, you know, as well.

Well, the Catholics are always, we're always dirty.

Yeah, I didn't want to say that, but I'm glad you put that out there.

Well, you know, we like we actually we're the sacred and the profane. We're into both, actually. Yeah.

Yeah. So so my mother was an elementary school art teacher and my dad moved into school administration pretty early in his career, did a lot of subbing. But a lot of his family worked at our school. Like my uncle was one of the custodians. I remember going to kindergarten.

My uncle was the guy who brought the cartons of milk into the room for snack break every afternoon. My mother was my elementary school art teacher. My dad was a high school guidance counselor for much of my life.

And you went to these schools?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Is that a weird thing? I mean, because, you know, you get picked on a little bit. My mom used to volunteer at our nursery school, and I used to feel really weirded out by that.

Yeah, yeah. I only ever had my mother as a teacher, and she made me call her Mrs. Lepore. And once in fourth grade, I spilled paint all over myself. I was trying to paint an orange giraffe, and I spilled the orange paint all over myself, and my mother just said, go home and clean yourself up.

And I remember walking home. It was a couple miles. I mean, I'd done it before. I was the youngest, so usually I walk to school with all my siblings. I'd never done it alone. Yeah. And I had to break into the house and do the laundry and take a shower and go back to school.

She was so mad. That was the thing I remember being roughest about my mother being my teacher. I was like, obviously, you wouldn't just tell some other kid to go. leave and to go like go take care of yourself i was nine the walk of shame covered

in orange paint i'm a very like i just i really remember how intently i was trying to do i was terrible at that kind of thing so i was really trying to do a good job because i wanted to press my mother and i'm terrible at it and i overextended and i knocked over the can

Are they still alive, if I ask? No. Okay. So what did you figure when you were going through high school you wanted to do with your life? Did you have any ideas about the future?

Yeah, I didn't want to go to college. We didn't have any money. And one of my siblings didn't go to college, the other two. At that point, my dad was working kind of part-time as an admissions officer in our local Catholic college. And so two of my siblings went there and lived at home because it was free.

And I had had a kind of crisis of faith when I was being confirmed. I didn't want to be confirmed. I didn't think I really... could swear fidelity to the church in the way that was required. My mother and I had a really tough time around that.

I didn't want to live at home and go to the local Catholic school. And there was no money. So I was like, you know what? I'm fine. I don't need to go. I'll do my own thing.

So did you get confirmed in the end or did you not?

I did get confirmed. Yeah, I have a picture with me with the Archbishop of Boston.

Who was your confirmation saint?

My confirmation saint was Mary. My middle name is Marie. Does she qualify? I don't know. I don't really remember that much about the actual ceremony.

Yeah, maybe I'm wrong then.

I mean, I can picture it. And I remember you had to go and have a one-on-one meeting with the bishop.

Mm-hmm.

And I remember saying to my mother, like, I can't lie to the bishop about my faith.

Good for you.

Anyway.

That's a very Catholic thing to say, actually.

Yeah, yes.

I mean, the deeper Catholic value, which is that you tell the truth.

Yeah. It was a real struggle.

Yeah. I remember mine, too. I went to Arundel Cathedral. Mm-hmm. And this is what I was like. Au contraire, I was not just a believing Catholic. I was a fanatical believing Catholic, age 14. And in England, my confirmation saint was Thomas More, just to say, fuck you to all the Protestants. That was where I was coming from,

which is when you grow up an Irish Catholic in England, you have a slightly different psychological response to your identity. So then, so you didn't want to go to college, but so what did you have in your back of your head of what you were going to spend your life doing? Was there anything?

I knew I wanted to be a writer. And yeah, so I just figured I'd find a way through doing that. We worked a lot as kids. We had a ton of jobs. I had saved quite a bit of money. You know, my dad made us fake work permits when we were young, when we were like 12,

saying we were 16 so we could work. So we had worked a lot.

Here I was reading your book about the child labor amendment.

Yeah, I remember there was a store detective.

Clearly, clearly the Constitution didn't prevent you from doing that.

I worked in a shoe department at a department store at one point because my sister was the manager and she hired me, even though I obviously looked like a little kid.

Your family is nepotistic beyond belief. All they do is hire family members.

I remember the store detective coming around, but I was, whatever, dealing with the inventory. And he was like, how old are you, Miss? And I was like, well, I'm obviously 16. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. I ended up, I was a big athlete in high school and I had a very strong sense of duty.

And so I applied to ROTC for an ROTC scholarship because my guidance counselor was like, if you can't afford to go to school, you can apply to ROTC. So I applied to ROTC and some kid I knew in my neighborhood was applying to the school called Tufts I'd never heard of.

I'd never been, other than my dad's college, I'd never been on a college campus. So I applied to one school. I applied to Tufts and I applied to the Air Force ROTC. And I got in and I got recruited as a varsity field hockey player and I got into the ROTC program. So I went there.

Where did your sense of duty come from?

My parents, my dad had left the church. Actually, this was a huge subjective ongoing dispute between my parents, especially in the Roe v. Wade era. My mother was very much followed the teachings of the church and my father did not. My father had gone, when he was in the service, he had gone to Protestant services and

During the war, because there was no Catholic mass. And when he came home, the first thing he did was go to his parish priest and go to confession. And he confessed that he had gone to Protestant services. And as he tells it, which is, I think, my father's colorful version of the story,

the priest hauled him out of the confessional and brought him out into the street and said, never come back here. You've spoiled yourself. And he never went back to church except for getting married or our baptisms. We had a Sunday paper route,

and my dad would take us on the paper route because it was a really long route, and the four of us would sit on the tailgate and deliver papers, and we were supposed to go to the 8 a.m. mass. And usually we did,

but sometimes my dad would pretend that he took us when we would just go out for donuts. Because he never went to church. He did not go to Mass. We just did. Why was that a story? Where were we going with that story?

Oh, duty.

Oh, yeah. So my dad, his whole thing was, I won't go to Mass, but I will do things that are meaningful in the world on that day. So when he was a young man, like before he married my mother, he would just go mow the lawns of old women in town for free.

Like, he spent his Sunday taking care of people's needs, taking care of the needs of the needy. He had a tremendous capacity for service and an extraordinary generosity with his time.

What a stupid priest. What a stupid priest.

Yeah, you know, but there's all that crazy. There's so much crazy. I remember it was a huge big deal when I was a kid. If you went to a sleepover... And your friend was Protestant or Jewish. I had a few Jewish friends in my town and then everybody else was Catholic except for a couple of Protestant friends.

It was always like, no, only on a Friday night can you have that sleepover because Sunday, you know, you obviously can't go to service with them. It was still a thing. Well, it was a thing for me.

It still is. I can't go to Anglican or Episcopalian service. I think I'd more easily go into a mosque, to be honest with you, in terms of just how I'm psychologically constructed. But anyway, history, what led you into that direction?

I am fascinated by how change happens and when it doesn't happen and what are the forces that lie behind change and also behind continuity. I'm not a historian's historian in the sense that I am not fascinated by the debates that historians have about about, you know, what we call historiographical issues, you know,

a crucial interpretive debate in which there are factions among scholars. I'm not interested in those questions. I also don't have any degrees in history. My degrees are in other things. So I am interested in the relationship between the past and the present, and I think much the same way as a novelist is, right?

Like you have characters, they begin in one place, they end up in another place. What, what, how? Is it them? Is it their circumstances? I've always been interested in those questions. I'm also keenly interested in evidence and in what survives and what doesn't survive. I've always been interested in the history of knowledge.

My grandmother didn't speak English and didn't read and write. And a lot of people in my family didn't read and write, like my uncle didn't read and write. And so this was like, as a kid, this was a bit of an issue. Like, I remember like, oh, you know,

there'd be times my grandmother was supposed to come take care of us, but there was an emergency and we had to leave, but we couldn't leave her a note. And I... It was just striking. I was a very, very bookish kid, unsurprisingly.

And just the idea of living in a universe where you were not going to leave behind a written record. It was just a kind of real thing in my life in a way that maybe it wasn't for other kids. I remember having to go do... I had a high school writing assignment.

I had this fantastic high school English teacher who left teaching and became a poet full time, a man I greatly admire, whose name is Thomas Moore, I'll just say, just to circle around. We had an assignment to find someone who knew how to do something we didn't know

how to do and have them teach us how to do it and write an account of how to do it. I just loved that because it's just an exercise in humility, right? It's just actually taking a bunch of 14-year-olds and saying, you know what? There's a lot of shit you don't know how to do.

There are a lot of people in the world who know a lot of things and you don't know everything. And it would be a nice thing to try to learn something for someone. I don't know. I just thought it was like a lovely assignment.

But it's a writing assignment. It's also interesting, isn't it?

Yeah.

You have to explain things. You have to kind of imagine. It's harder to write about reality than about abstractions.

I think that's true. Although there's the lavishness of detail that, you know, there are pegs in the wall that you're climbing. Anyway, I decided I would do... I greatly regretted that. I could never communicate, especially with my grandmother. I didn't learn Italian. Everybody spoke Italian, but the kids in my family did not.

All our cousins and aunts and uncles and everybody did. But I think my mother, because my mother was not Italian, she was like, we're not going to do this. So I decided to go spend a day with my grandmother and learn how to make meatballs.

Yeah.

And, you know, it was crazy impossible. She obviously doesn't have a recipe. She also just does different things depending on how things are in her garden. And she just was very clear. She thought I was an idiot, which I was. I was like, I don't understand.

How can you do this if you don't know how much you normally put in? She's like, well, I put in this much. Anyway, it was a really fun writing assignment.

But I want to focus on this because actually that is... is a crucial question, is it not? How does a society change? Can it be written down? You know, can you write down, this is how you make a meatball? I mean, you can, but the actual making of a meatball is a slightly different phenomenon.

I mean, very different phenomenon. The techniques required, the feel, the sense that she might have of what's in the garden, the ingredients and all the rest of it. It's a very intuitive thing. Now, I know this may sound a stretch of an analogy, but that's what I was trying to get. What is a constitution?

It's an attempt, is it not? We're going to do the meatball analogy, right? The attempt of a constitution is to write down what your grandmother did. It is to put on paper the emerging interaction of a group of people who are trying to set up a political community that already exists in a way because they're already there,

but there comes a moment in which they write it down. Now, of course, that in America happened because they started from scratch. What were they going to do? Tell me... How did the American Constitution come out? Why did they do it?

Yeah, it's interesting because, of course, England doesn't have a written constitution, and that was sort of the default. It's not that people didn't talk about constitutions. Like, the colonists kept complaining that Parliament was behaving unconstitutionally, right, that these taxes were unconstitutional.

So what did they mean by that?

They meant that it violated the constitution, the assemblage of laws that constitute the authority of the state.

Hmm.

and the rights of the people and that they are understood and that there had been historically, certainly in England, an understanding that these are essentially ethereal, right? There is evanescent, not as evanescent, there is ethereal as like a sunbeam, right? Hamilton talked about constitutional principles as like a shaft of, you know,

a sunbeam or a shaft of light. Montesquieu talked about the spirit of the laws, right? Like there are these fundamental ideas that we have to hold, right? these truths, right? Like we have to cherish these ideas because we give them spirit. But the idea that you would write them down,

there are historians and legal scholars argue about why the American Constitution is written down. And it sort of begs the question, right? The answer is really because the state constitutions were written down first. Okay, but why were the state constitutions written down first? Well, One kind of good argument is the colonies had charters.

So when you went to found, you know, Massachusetts Bay Colony or Virginia or New Jersey, you got a charter, a piece of paper from the king that they're mainly royal charters, right, that say you can have this land, you know, it's ours.

You will be English subjects so long as you live there and you have to obey or whatever. It just sets out the terms really of settlement. And when the colonies broke with England, their charters were null and void and their leaders all fled. Like the royal governors just turned tail.

Like when the colonists were like gathering their muskets and saying, we're not going to pay these taxes. The royal governors just fled. A lot of them were governed by really royally appointed councils, like an upper house of a colonial legislature. The provincial assemblies all dissolved. There was no government, but they were used to having a charter.

So this is, you know, this is really like as across 1775 is when the war starts. The fighting breaks out in April 1775. The royal governors start running away. The government. Former colonies now think of themselves as states. They have no government. By the end of 1775, the Continental Congress is like, OK, well, actually, first of all,

you need some working governments in these states. And so New Hampshire is the first in January of 1776 to say, all right, we know what we're going to do. We are going to write down. what our fundamental law and our frame of government is. We'll call it a constitution.

We know what a constitution is, but ours is going to be written down. And so partly they wanted to write it down because they were replacing a charter, which was written down. But also they wanted to write it down because the whole complaint with Parliament was you could never say to Parliament that's unconstitutional because of Article 4,

Section 2, Paragraph.

five there was nothing to point to well you you could say oh king so-and-so did this and he accepted that and we've done that for the last 50 years why are you changing it that that's roughly how you can say it but you and what army

But the Constitution, as we're finding out, do not have an army to defend them. They are in some ways a mutually agreed upon fiction in a way. They're a construction.

Yeah. But here's the other thing.

So they were trying to delineate what?

But they were trying to say, we're setting up a government. It has these powers and will work this way. And it has only these powers. They generally also included in the Constitution. They declared the rights of the people. And there had been, you know,

there had been a declaration of rights in England that came out of the English Civil War of the 17th century. So like the idea of declaring rights and constituting a government, these, they're not American inventions, but they do this in this particular way, kind of all at once.

And then over the course of that spring, you know, there's still not the United States. It's the Continental Congress. And then there are these 13 states. And so John Adams writes this. John Adams is just a very funny curmudgeon. He writes a letter. I think it's to Richard Henry Lee.

He's like, all right, look, we got to each state has to have a government. It's got to have a written constitution. They should have declarations. But also we need to declare independence. And then also we need our own like we need the Federation needs a constitution.

And well, what's the way like the order we should do these things is like ABCDE. And Richard Henry is like we were at war. We like these things are all going to happen, but they're probably not going to happen the order that you want them to happen. Right. Adams wanted he wrote this book called Thoughts on Government,

which he laid out like, here's what every state's constitution should look like, because he had been an incredibly astute student of government and the structure of government. So he was like, here's our model. And the different states are like, yeah, well, thanks, John, we'll do our own thing.

So they begin experimenting like with a different arrangement of government. Each state comes up with a different idea.

But what's new about this, is it not, is that, yes, they're setting up a government, but they're really setting up a system to limit the government. They're setting up a system of government for the first time that seeks... to restrain government from its get-go.

Monarchs, or in tradition, in old Europe, the thing was a slow surrender of powers in many ways. But here, brand new. And the point is, you start not with the authority, but the freedom from authority, which makes them a very interesting thing. What do you think, I mean, ultimately was the point... to construct a new country,

or was the point to restore what they regarded as ancient English freedoms?

The point was to restore ancient English freedoms, certainly initially. The idea of even declaring independence from England was, you know, it took more than a year from the beginning of the war, right? Imagine that, right? Fighting this war for a year with people, there's not enough support to declare independence from the mother country.

So it's quite a hard fight. I mean, this is the subject of Adams' frustration, right? Like, well, can't we declare independence already? It's really in January of 1776 is when Tom Paine, fairly recent immigrant from England, writes Common Sense, this pamphlet that is unlike Adams' thoughts on government.

Common Sense is written, you know, as is often said, in the language of the King James Bible. Like everybody can read Common Sense, and it's full of... very homegrown metaphors to get back to your sort of meatballs, you know, just the, the, the, the idea that, you know, like, you know,

it's time for us to put on our pants kind of thing. We need to stop sucking at the tit of England. Like there's, it has almost like adjacent vulgarity to it. It has a real earthiness to it. The metaphors tend to come from like animal husbandry. You know,

there's a lot about the exposing the ridiculousness of the notion of the divine right of Kings and, just sort of like look around, like, do you see any grandchildren of very esteemed men who seem to be worthy of it? No, like it's sort of like it has this very earthy colloquial quality and it

dramatically changes people's opinions across the states. And people are like, You know, this pain guy has for a long time. Common Sense is published anonymously. And for a long time, people, everyone think Adams must have written it. And Adams like, God damn it. No, I didn't write it. Who wrote that thing? He's like so jealous.

Adams cannot write that way.

No, he couldn't. That's not Adams at all.

No, he just couldn't. But it was just he, the person who had been making the argument so vehemently. And it is, you know, it's the same argument. Well, it's from a different perspective. From a very different perspective for a very different audience. It's extremely persuasive. And it's at that point that...

And one of the things that Paine says is we need to write constitutions. Like, this is our moment. And he says, and here's the thing that Paine says that is, I actually think it's sort of very beautiful. So Paine and these, they basically believed in natural law and natural rights, right? That there existed,

partly they use it as a thought experiment, but they also kind of mean it literally, that Before government, before people erected governments, they lived in chaos and they came together and decided to erect governments. And we then that that has been corrupted in that we now, you know,

we in 17 or early 1776 now live in a world in which we have not consented to the government that we have. We are at war with the government that we have. But we have the opportunity that no one since the beginning of time has had.

We can participate and bear witness to our capacity for self-government by devising constitutions that establish limited powers of government and define and delineate the rights of the people. And the state's like, OK, let's do it. I'm just like, let's do it. People start writing these constitutions. And then more than that,

the thing that happens a little bit more gradually, which I think is really fascinating, is At first, it's sort of like the who's ever kind of serving in whatever vestigial legislative body there is in the states writes the constitutions. But then the people are like, OK, wait, no, we are actually consenting to be governed.

We have to write the constitutions. And not only that, once people that we vote to a special convention to write a constitution write one, it has to come back to us to see if we approve of what they did. And then beyond that,

We're not going to approve it unless it has an amendment provision in it where if we need to change it, we can change it. So Massachusetts finally gets around to writing a constitution in 1778. It takes them a while to get it together. And people reject it. It goes to the towns. The legislature essentially writes it.

It doesn't really have a good amendment provision. It goes to the towns for ratification. And these towns are like, yeah, no, we need an amendment clause and we need to have a convention. the crucial pieces of what a constitution will have it will have a declaration of

rights it will have an amendment provision it will be drafted by a convention elected by the people and not by the legislature you don't want the legislature writing your constitution they're just going to give the legislative branch too much power and that it will have an amendment provision that will not be the where

amendment will also not be the exclusive power of the sitting government it has to sort of go back And it takes a long time for those kind of core principles of American constitutionalism to get established across all of the states. Some of the states don't have amendment provisions for a long time,

or ratification doesn't go to the people for a long time.

So you have these, what we call state rules. conventions first. Let's call them concons, because that's a state concon, constitutional convention. And they come up with, obviously, they're influenced. I mean, you don't really go into this much in the book and the political theory behind all of this. But obviously, the ideas of Locke, the ideas of Montesquieu,

the ideas of the ancients, even, I mean, many of these young founders had read extraordinarily widely and deeply about this. But then you have this being pioneered from the bottom up. Tell us about – I mean, what I was really – one of the things I learned from the book was that not only

were the state conventions incredibly popular, they popped up all over the place, but that they kept popping up. That people, once they got in the habit of conventions, these extra legislative, extra everything idea where you could throw everything up in the air and start over – Lots of people did them. African-Americans did them. Women did them.

They had their own little conventions and said, this is the way we want the world to run. Tell us a little bit about that and how that movement came about.

Yeah. So the state started practicing having conventions. And then, of course, the Federal Convention of 1787 meets and it is borrowing from the conventions established at these other conventions. But the tradition continues. And there's, you know, at one level, just a practical reason why people keep having to convene again. There are a lot of new states.

and a new state's going to write a constitution. Well, the new states are going to have new ideas, and they're going to put some new things in their constitution. And then the old states are going to be like, ah, that's an interesting idea. Maybe we'll do that. And then there's a lot of demographic change, right?

So there's a lot of movement of population, even within settled states. A lot of the population moves to the western parts of the states, or the western parts of the states become... more urban than they were before. But essentially, there are problems of representation, given the dispersal of the population, that often warrant a new convention.

But you could say, are there other ways to handle some of those things, right? And there are other ways to handle some of those things. But the practice of holding a convention... becomes, I mean, Tocqueville says this too when he's watching the 1830s. There's just so many conventions. All the states are meeting a convention by the 1830s.

These black conventions have started happening. Women's conventions don't start to the 1840s, but there are Native nations who are holding constitutional conventions by the 1830s. And Tocqueville's like, you know, it is what this is, is just these people really believe in the sovereignty of the people and they would like to do it. They want to actually embody

the their own sovereignty by coming together and deciding on fundamental matters of fundamental law, that this what is to us, I think, and maybe this is not the case of all our men, but like I think the sort of the notion that we the people choose our Constitution, I don't think feels right. A real.

It's a constitutional fiction to Americans today, right? Like, OK, we know we the people, blah, blah, blah. You can sing the preamble. I learned it in Schoolhouse Rock. But like, do you believe that you are the author of our Constitution? I don't think we have that anymore. I mean,

maybe some people have some of that about their state constitutions if they, you know, when they vote on a ballot initiative to amend the Constitution, they have some sense of that. But to gather together and to know that your fellow citizens are gathering together and you participate in electing them to decide on these crucial matters of

fundamental law, deliberate over them, bring those back to you. That's just a, it's a little bit like jury duty. Like imagine we lived in a world where we once had jury duty and then gradually we stopped bothering. Like we didn't let AI decide the guilt or innocence of people or something like that.

So now there still exists the criminal justice system and civil trials. But we just don't, none of us has ever been called for jury duty in generations. People don't know what that would require. And then if you say to somebody, look, we want to bring back jury duty, we should have random lottery and call 12 citizens,

good and true, into a room, and they're going to decide the guilt or in a sense of... accused defendants, people would be like, no, we couldn't possibly do that. That's crazy. Like, how would you trust ordinary people to make such a decision? But that's what conventions were, right? That the practice was, it's very similar.

Like, it's not just, it's a way to revise a constitution or to draft a new one. It's that is a way to renew our civil society through the exercise of our capacity for self-government. It's a muscle that, you know, has significantly atrophied, right? So it's not just that we have never had a second federal constitutional convention,

but the last full state constitutional convention was 1986, right? Decades and decades ago. No one remembers a state constitutional convention.

I just try to remember, imagine, you've lived your entire life knowing that everything that happens is coming from the king or some element of that centralized power is coming towards you. And suddenly that goes. And so you, it's thrilling. It's completely new. Of course, people are, once they start to feel their oats of self-government,

get extremely psyched about it. And you have this, what seems to me to be this unbelievable flourishing of civic... energy, civic energy, which Tocqueville saw so dramatically to, which is probably, let's ask you this, it's a functioning part of the change, exactly what you're saying with the jury.

It's like, this is new, not just, it's not something we used to do. This is completely new. We're the authors of our own identity, which is, of course, contagious. And that, of course, is why the women conventions, the African-American event, because you're suddenly like, wait, we control this country.

So that's a very radical idea for most people in the late 18th century. It really is, right? Yeah.

I mean, given what they're used to. Of course. I mean, in some parts of the country, they have precedence for it. Like the New England town meeting is a bit like that, right? The New England town meeting, people are, everyone goes, you argue it out. There's no sign of the king.

No, you go to my local province town. First of all, it's It's it's people are really rude. Yeah, it's it's a real set. You leave that exhausted. But boy, is it direct democracy? I mean, man, you see your neighbors, you bring up this, that and the other.

Yeah. And I guess it's important to say it's not it's not necessarily beautiful. Like it can be an extraordinarily ugly thing like most of what these state constitutions are. doing, they're extending the franchise. Like a big project of all these state constitutions, you know, starting in the Jacksonian era is to drop property requirements for voting so that

all white men can vote. And then that means that anybody who's dirt poor can vote. And that means that free black men can vote. And so then they all introduce racial restrictions on voting. Like they're not like, oh, everything is just everything when they get together is beautiful and perfect.

The reason that women and black people have their own conventions is that they're being systematically written out of these conventions that had kind of vague and more, you know, loosely interpretable terms.

They don't have the words white attached to names, to objects.

They don't talk about, they add white and they add male to their state constitutions. So,

you know,

women and black men have their own constitutions and it's really interesting what they do there, but they wouldn't be doing it if they hadn't systematically been being removed from essentially the protection of the laws under state constitutions.

But all of it is a kind of just agreement that we will all agree. There's no massive military force designed to enforce the constitution. It can't be, because that would be a power that would overwhelm the constitution. Now, your book has this particular focus on amendments, which I found curious.

Obviously amendments are part of the process because inevitably things change in a society and something that is constructed in 1776 is not likely, or 1789 rather, is not likely to be, is likely to have challenges in 1889, let alone in 1989, because things happen. What do you think are the most important shifts that required

some sort of constitutional adjustment. I mean, what was, what was, what was driving that? Why did the constitution have to change is what I'm, is what I'm getting at. Why were the amendments necessary?

Well, the Constitution itself was necessary because the existing pact, the Articles of Confederation, was useless and also unamendable. So during the war, the colonies had come, even before the war, had begun to draft basically a treaty among the 13 states to join together in opposing parliamentary taxation and then later fighting the war.

But all 13 states had to agree to any change to it. And so people kept trying to change it and they kept failing. So that's why we even have a constitution in the first place. So a lesson that was learned by that experience and was also learned from the early

state constitution is you really need an amendment process. Because it is very thrilling to write down a constitution and be able to hold your rulers accountable to an agreement. But it's also dangerous because then you're stuck with it. And what if it just doesn't work anymore? Like, you need what Washington called a constitutional door.

It should always be left open to the people. So they knew they needed such a thing. The trick was just also... The whole constitution was a series of compromises. So they also, the people that had made those compromises, like maybe some of these things can be amended out one day. No one was really happy with, I mean,

you know, not that they weren't pleased with, but no one was like, this is perfect. That would have been crazy, right? They all knew that it was going to need repair.

Amend is an interesting word. You delve into that a little bit, because you are... A constitution, definitionally, is the constitutive element, the thing that can't change, but... At the same time, it has to change. So there is this tension constantly, right, between keeping it as it is and adjusting to change.

So you then get this classic liberal conservative tension between people who are nervous of change and people who think change is absolutely vital. You have, on one extreme, no change ever. On the other extreme, let's just transform the whole thing overnight. When I look at the history of the American Constitution, I'm actually struck by, first of all,

how its worries about government are really quite deep. In other words, it's quite a conservative document, it seems to me, I would argue, in terms of its restrictions of things. But actually, it's done pretty well in adjusting over the centuries. Obviously, it's had amendments and other amendments, but some periods have seen push in one direction,

others in another, as the book points out. But I don't consider it a failure, but your book seems to suggest that it is.

I think the Constitution, as it was originally drafted, is strongest in establishing within its very structure checks against the abuse of power. And that is what the framers... were most worried about being amended out of it, right? That these, they considered themselves, in a sense, clockmakers, and they were very,

very carefully weighted gears and checks and balances that you just really shouldn't be tinkering with. That there was a kind of an exquisiteness to the mechanical device itself, right? Yet they were all also, to a person, unhappy with the compromises behind it, and they all worried that the mechanism would kind of drift out of joint.

You know, some were worried about judicial power, others were worried about executive power. The complicated... compromises between the slave states and the free states and between the big states and the small states, those, anybody who's paying any attention recognized, those were not going to be durable, right? The states were going to change. They didn't know how fast.

They didn't know what, you know, what the entry of new states to the union would mean to that arrangement, what changing population would mean. They just really, like nobody was happy with those compromises. And yet we're still stuck with the legacy of some of those compromises.

Well, no one was completely happy with those compromises, but were prepared to live with them, given the alternative. I think that's probably what we're saying.

Yeah, the alternative was the South was going to walk, right? Remember, 55 guys went, 70 guys were elected, 55 guys went, only 39 signed the thing. Its ratification was a very, very close call. So, you know, you can say and I disagree that it has proved extraordinarily durable.

And I think the durability is a function of the precision with which the powers of the different branches of the federal government were balanced. But it needed amending from the start. And everyone understood that.

Yeah. The question is how much and how often and how major should the amendments be? Let's talk about, and what I found fascinating was that from the beginning, there have been proposals that sound extremely contemporary, but actually were there in the 1830s, were there like direct election of senators, which was, when did that idea first come?

percolate up was that where i'm trying to think what the first when the first is

that the 1830s yeah i don't know off the top of my head it's certainly in the 1830s that the states begin revising out of their state constitutions the indirect election of their senators or in some cases the indirect election of the governor they would have the legis state legislature elect the governor um that was a a very

common late 18th century aristocratic provision and I don't think I don't there's not a lot of agitation. I think it maybe it's not till the 1850s that you see a first serious proposal introduced into Congress, because by the time that actually comes about in the 19 teens, there's a lot of discussion of how long it took.

And I want to say it took like between 60 and 70 years or something like, you know, it took decades to accomplish that once once it was first seriously bandied about as something in need of remedy.

Yeah. And that's the other thing that the Constitution, the U.S. Constitution does. It's worried also about the people. I mean, it's worried about the mob. It's worried about popular passions overwhelming societies. And as we are currently... experiencing, these things do happen. And America particularly, a quite emotionally volatile country, has a bunch of crazy stuff going on there.

So they also wanted, that was the point of the equal apportionment in the Senate in some ways, and the indirect elections, was to keep elite control, to prevent mass democracy.

Well, the point of the equal portion of the Senate was to appease the small states that were mad about the slave states getting extra representation under the three-fifths

clause. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, but they were also, you know, let's talk about the other things before I forget. The Electoral College was also this huge big issue. Now, the Electoral College is also about small and big states. It's also about slavery and slave and free states. But it's also, it seems to me, a statement that

the states still matter. We don't have a national popular vote for president. The states matter, and it matters that there's some geographical diversity. Now, in the debates over that, I mean, I come at all this in a weird kind of way because I grew up in another country with another kind of constitution,

but I can see the point of that. I can see the fact that that in many big countries with big urban centers, no one goes to the, no one campaigns in small little towns in the countryside. That you could see why the Electoral College was constructed the way it was, right?

I mean, you can see the point of it.

Sure. I mean, they had a real debate about it. And again, I don't think that there was a whole lot of like, wow, we created the perfect thing. You know, there was a proposal, James Wilson of Pennsylvania said, look, let's just have a popular vote. Like, let the people decide. People are like, yeah, no, no,

And it wasn't, you know, the part of that is for sure, you're right, like a distrust of the mob. That would be an excess of democracy.

And of demagogues. They're very worried about demagogues.

Yes, but part of that was they didn't think anybody could know anybody who wasn't from their own state. The time it takes to travel, the limited nature of communication, even just during ratification, a lot of people had never read the Constitution. It was like hard to get printed copies to them.

So we tend to forget how much that was about the... This is before the transportation revolution of the 1830s, 1840s. There's no railroads. There's no telegraphs. It's like just very hard to know canals. Like, well, how could we have a national election? Nobody's going to know the candidates. Right. Just doesn't make any sense.

So, well, OK, so then the next day is, well, let's just have Congress select the president. Those people will know the candidates because they're basically just going to be. people who are known to the most elite of the political elite. Well, that's a violation of the separation of powers. OK, so we need a third way.

And the third way ends up being availing itself because they've just come up with what is called the Connecticut Compromise, which is, you know, making this deal that the southern states get the three fifths clause so that they can have outsized representation in the lower house of this new Congress and the small

states get equal suffrage in the Senate so they can have outsized representation in the Senate. OK, we figured that out. Actually, why don't we just take that compromise and use that to construct a means to elect the president that gets us out of like we don't want the people to do it.

We don't want Congress to do it. We'll call those people. That number, that number of delegates will be who elect. So they import these compromises into this new political invention that becomes the Electoral College. And, you know, it's immediately riddled with problems because, of course, four of the first five presidents are from Virginia. Right.

both the most populous state and the state with a huge slave population. So the New Englanders are like, okay, dude, this is not going to work for us. First of all, the only reason we agreed to any of this crap was because South Carolina and Georgia said they were going to walk away.

And, you know, I've lost five sons in this war, and I'm not going to see us not have a country. But also, what kind of country is it if Virginia is just going to be electing all the presidents?

Right.

So there's already by 1803 proposals made by New Englanders. And some of them are still opposed to slave representation on principle because they're opposed to slavery. Most of them are just angry about the lack of political power.

Right. Because population becomes power. And you can see today why if... the Electoral College did not exist, there would be no campaign. I mean, now we have a sort of perverse thing in which they only campaign the seven states in the Midwest. But without that,

they'd only be campaigning in the major urban centers of the coasts or the North, right? So it's a way in which the founders were beginning to think about The expansion of this country, because that's the other thing that you're setting up a constitution for a country

that's shortly going to become about five times as big as it then was. And so you then have what we now have, which is this insane contrast between North Dakota and California, with North Dakota having two senators and California having two senators. That does seem to me to be a grotesque distortion.

If the founders saw that, they'd be like, that went wrong.

Yeah. And that also is a compromise that is so important to just holding the convention together. Like the chance that the convention was just going to disassemble itself was pretty high. But so Article 5 of the Constitution, which lays out the process for amending the Constitution, has two exceptions to it,

which are the first is a concession to the slave states that you it's a promise that you can't amend the Constitution to abolish the slave trade for 20 years. Mm hmm. Because they were all like, we know you guys are just waiting. As soon as we get this thing out there, you're going to want to, you know.

And the other is, you can't amend the Constitution to end equal suffrage in the Senate. So it was like, it was just like, okay, Rhode Island, okay, South Carolina, you guys have what you want. Now can we finally go home? It's late August. It's really hot. We miss our wives.

Like, there's just a desperation to that at the end. You're like, you can see the tenuousness of the compromises that, like, we all really believe in amendment, but some of us really don't. Some Some of us are like, we're only signing on to this if we have these two senators. God damn it.

We're only signing on to this if you're not going to end, you know, our property and people right now. So it's it is a very it's a tenuous thing. And those and those. remain problems. I mean, the three-fifths clause, of course, is voided by the 13th Amendment,

but the Electoral College is still a function of that equal suffrage in the Senate provision. And the century of representation that was skewed in that way created what abolitionists called the slave power, which led to the Civil War.

Mm-hmm.

And we still live in the shadow of that war. Yes.

The war, in some ways, resolved things the Constitution didn't. Which suggests, in fact, the Constitution couldn't have resolved them without such a conflict at some point. I want to talk about how societies adapt to change. Things change. Economies change. Climate changes. Demographies, demographics change, et cetera, et cetera.

And it's kind of interesting to think of several ways within our system in which that can happen. You can pass a law, which is by far the most common and simplest way of changing things, right? Right. Then you could have, as we're now discovering, and this is a relatively new thing, actually, executive orders,

which seem to leverage the power of the federal government as it has become to force other people to change things. Then you have... Supreme Court rulings, which, like the Dobbs thing, will dramatically change the way the country decides a question like abortion. Or you can have a constitutional convention in which you put all these stuff up and

you... So those are four mechanisms for adjusting to change. And of those, the CONCONs basically haven't really... They've failed. They haven't really... The EOs seem to be taking... considerable control at this point. Now, the problem with the con-con, let's go to FDR now. The problem with the con-con, because this is a fascinating moment, isn't it?

When FDR is confronted with the fact that he can't. The Constitution, as the founders constructed it, was not about what FDR was about to do. He was going to violate the very basic structure of individual liberty and freedom of contract and all the rest of it.

Freedom of contract is not in the Constitution, so I'm going to dispute that assertion, but you can proceed and we'll go from there. I'm going to stipulate your interpretation that FDR was voiding the Constitution.

Well, I think he was definitely trying to. You can think that. Well, I think he did. I think he transformed the Constitution into something very alien to what was originally thought. But anyway, let's go through what he was saying.

We can disagree there. I'm just laying out. We have ventured into an area of strenuous disagreement, which is fine, but I'm just not going to nod along. I know.

I know. I know. I know. You don't. You're not. a believer in that old school liberalism as is, as is, as is apparent in the book. So what are you, he, he's stuck, right? So what does he do? He has various options. He can, he can pack the court or he can propose.

There's no, that's the actual number of justices in the constitution. He can call a constitutional convention to actually put the whole new deal on a new constitutional authority and And he chooses to... What he does is something much cleverer than either of those things, actually. Walk us through what he did and what his thoughts were.

Yeah, sure. But I think you have to back up a little bit because FDR's experience with constitutional revision dates not to his presidency in the New Deal, but to the Progressive Era and the Progressive Era Amendments. So progressives aligning with populists after the Civil War had for decades been trying to establish what in other countries, you know,

are often constitutionalized by amendment as social and economic rights. Right. Our Constitution enshrines political rights and in the Bill of Rights and in the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendment, the Civil War and Reconstruction Amendments. But, you know, in the it is a consequence of the Industrial Revolution and other countries. And in fact,

most of the American states are beginning to constitutionalize social and economic rights like maximum hours and minimum or child labor amendments to their state constitutions. And along with women's suffrage and a big, big campaign. So a lot of states are doing that. By the 1890s, the Western states are granting women the right to vote, for instance.

But that's a political right, not a social economic right.

But it's often it's kind of smuggled in as a social and economic right. Like we'll be able to abolish child labor if women could vote. Like we'll be able to care for children better if women could. It's interesting, that rhetorical piece of it. But you're absolutely right. So progressives are really successful at amending the Constitution.

Four amendments are ratified between 1913 and 1920. And importantly, the long decades long campaign to constitutionalize the income tax. So progressives have are kind of riding high with like, well, you know, we're able to amend the Constitution. We have established these these new reforms, one of which is prohibition. And we're set that aside for the moment.

But in 1924, after the Supreme Court strikes down a child, federal child, child labor laws, progressives put forward. And this is not a Republican Democrat thing. Progressivism in this era is across all the party, the major parties. put forward the Child Labor Amendment to amend the Constitution to prohibit child labor.

And Eleanor Roosevelt is really involved in that. And so is FDR through, you know, during the time that he's governor of New York. So here's what seems like, oh, here's like the next, the next in a sort of inevitable new constitutional amendment. This is the way to go.

But there's a huge campaign organized really by Southern textile mill owners to defeat the Child Labor Amendment's It passes, like, the House on the day it's introduced. Like, there's huge public support for this.

But it is... Why doesn't Congress just pass a law?

Congress has passed two laws, but the conservative Lochner era court has struck them both down as unconstitutional because of your freedom of contract that you say is in the

Constitution. But a state could.

The states have. The states have. Yeah. But a lot of child labor is employed by companies that are working across states and they managed to evade the laws by working across between between states. So there's a need for federal legislation. So anyway, it looks like it still might pass. It's just really kind of delayed.

It seemed like it was going to be ratified immediately, and it doesn't happen. So by the time FDR is sitting in the White House and Congress has passed these measures for his New Deal, he's done a lot by executive order, but unlike, say, this Trump administration, most of what FDR accomplishes is,

although he uses executive order in an unprecedented way when he takes office in 1933, You know, the Congress passes, I think, 70 bills in 1933. Like most of what FDR is doing is very much with Congress. But not by 1935. The conservative Supreme Court has begun to strike these things down.

So he meets with his advisers and there really is exactly as you say, there's a real question. What what should we do? Really, in some sense, the proper thing to do would be to amend the Constitution. And you could do that. I don't think he's really thinking about a constitutional convention.

But according to you, there was no problem. the Constitution already allows forbidding child labor, right? So why do you need...

Well, he needs the court to make a different decision if that's the case,

right?

The court has already struck down, the court has overturned two congressional laws regulating, one was taxing and one was prohibiting child labor, right? So this is a point at which, you know, progresses Florence Kelly, the great labor leader says, like, I mean... Maybe we could have women on the court.

Like, do people not understand what it costs children to be employed? Like, the children don't have any choice. Like, there's just a huge, huge progressive outrage about the court saying, we can do nothing. This is just not a matter for the Constitution. We do. So after you are sort of looking at what his options are,

the court's going to strike down the New Deal. One idea would be to go for constitutional amendments. He's not going to hold a constitutional convention. There was a really important threat of a constitutional convention in the 19-teens that was very effective. Constitutional convention is generally most effective as a threat. But he didn't really have time for that.

Like, we're still in the Depression. Yeah. And he just he just says, like, it just it takes about a million dollars to defeat a constitutional amendment in this country right now. And he has the National Manufacturers Association, which, you know, Democrats call the millionaires lobby, who are really keen to undo the New Deal. And it takes time.

He just doesn't. Yeah, it takes time. He just doesn't think he's going to get an amendment through. And there seems to be another path, which is basically just to brazen it out with the court at some level. Right. He comes up with the court packing plan, which is a little bit like the threat of a constitutional convention.

It's like this is how we this is actually how we got rid of direct election of the senators. Right. The constitutional amendment to change to so the people could elect their own senators got through the House again and again and again and again, but has to be passed two thirds of the Senate.

And the Senate is like, what? No, we'll never get elected. We all want to run for reelection. And so eventually the states like nearly enough states to call a convention, get together and like we're calling a convention to get rid of you guys.

And they're like, OK, OK, OK, we'll do, you know, we'll get, you know, we'll vote for this. So there is some precedent for using a mechanism like that. But I think, you know, also kind of thinking of Eleanor Roosevelt's experiment experience has really been very active in the child labor amendment ratification process. process and its failure.

FDR is like, I'm just not going to go for a constitutional. It's quite a fateful thing. You know, there's a, you know, there's a very famous historical, legal historical argument, you know, that it is FDR that kills Article 5 because he just says, like, we're just not going to do that.

But how do you how do you muscle your way through the court? There had been a lot of competing proposals that This judicial overreach of a Supreme Court striking down not state laws, which the court, of course, can do, but striking down laws passed by Congress. needed to be remedied.

One amendment that has been frequently proposed is requiring, you know, like seven out of nine to strike down a congressional law. Like, you need like a super majority. Like, okay, if the Supreme Court wants to exercise this judicial supremacy, there needs to be a restraint on it. And that actually, there's some of the more interesting proposals.

But anyway, FTR, so essentially kind of Bullies and Brazins' way through it and the court reverses itself. And then in 1938 in the Fair Labor Standards Act, the child labor is effectively abolished and the court doesn't overturn the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Yeah, it blinks. It blinks and lets it pass. You barely mention the Prohibition Amendment in the book, which was striking to me, because wouldn't, if you were worried about amendments and that path, the Article 5 path, prohibition be a really big problem for you?

Because this is an amendment that really is not about the constitutive political entity as such. It's social policy. And of course, it was an absolute catastrophe in terms of undermining the legitimacy of the rule of law in terms of throwing the country into complete mess. Did that experience also help kill the con con or sorry,

the the amendment process as as effectively as as as anybody else?

You know, there really is tremendous scholarship on prohibition and the repeal of prohibition. My colleague, Lisa McGurr, has a fantastic book about it. It's just such a rich social and economic and political and cultural history. And it's fascinating. Like, it's truly interesting. I didn't like you're absolutely right. I don't give it.

I don't pay it a lot of either to prohibition or the repeal. But I don't pay a lot of attention really to any of the original 10 amendments either. It's like it's really not a history of the amendments that were ratified. So I agree it's really important and interesting. To the degree that I do talk about it,

I'm really fascinated by – and I don't think historians have really reckoned with the influence of this guy James Montgomery Beck, who was known as Mr. Constitution in his day. He was really opposed to constitutional change as he saw it in any form. I mean, he believed in judicial supremacy,

but he happened to live in an era of a very – really the most conservative court the country's ever had. So it was perfectly fine for him for constitutional change to come by way of the courts. But he was really opposed to the 16th Amendment, the income tax amendment, to the 17th Amendment prohibition – I'm sorry,

to the direct election of – The direct election of the Senate, he was opposed to prohibition, he was opposed to women's suffrage. So he hated all those four progressive era amendments. The only amendment he ever really liked was the repeal of prohibition. And it's kind of interesting to watch that journey because by the early 30s, Beck,

who has been enormously influential, he writes this really important, the kind of most widely read book about the Constitution in the first half of the 20th century in terms of popular readership. He believes the Constitution was perfect. Originally, it has never really needed amended.

Anything tinkering that needs to be done can be done by the nine old men. But he's really opposed to prohibition. And he's also so opposed to the New Deal that by the 1930s, he becomes... He proposes there being not a constitutional convention, but like a meeting of 200 of the most eminent men to propose amendments to the

Constitution. Because I think like he just is like people who are opposed to amendment and prefer the court to make changes. They just don't tend to really last the test of their principles when the nature of the court changes. And Beck is a good example of that.

But you also have Woodrow Wilson at the other end of the extreme, who basically becomes president saying, I don't really believe in this constitution at all.

Well, he's been a professor of constitutional law.

I know, and he hates it. He does believe in it.

He's also not keen to amend it. He doesn't support the women's suffrage amended for years and years and years until his lack of support threatens his re-election.

Let's get to the nub of this, which also gets to the question of original intent, which you also deal with, which is that if the Constitution is... There has to be some middle ground between the constitution being completely malleable and the constitution being completely unchangeable, right? So how do we measure that?

Do we ascribe to the founders of this country and to the political philosophy they adhered to and the ideas they believed in something in some ways eternal, something that represents a particular distillation of a particular form of Anglo-American liberalism that actually is the core of our country.

And you don't want to mess with it because they were geniuses. This has worked. And in fact, if we want to change it, we should ask ourselves, what were they trying to do? What were the ideas that informed them? To use William F. Buckley's analogy that you cite, if you have a will that's left by someone,

you ask, what did the person who wrote this will intend, if there's ambiguity or some imprecision? It seems to me, in this way, if you abandon any concept of that, You're kind of at sea.

That is not what they believed. I think that many people believe that in good faith now. That is a mode of interpreting and understanding and, in fact, worshipping the Constitution that has a wide purchase. I think worship's a little excessive, but respect. A sense of fidelity. I think would characterize what you've described.

I think that's widespread and I think it's earnestly felt. It is not original to the constitution. It's not what the framers thought or how they thought about constitutionalism.

They did not think that natural rights exist and cannot be violated.

They thought that constitutions are fallible.

Well, yes, but that's, that's, but no, answer my first question.

Did they think that natural rights exist? Yes. yes yes now to that from that did they also think that the mass of humanity did not possess natural rights yes but we can extend okay we can extend where you like but we but but but no because the principle is the same though is it possible

Yes, of course it is. If an individual has a right, you've come up with the idea of individual rights, and when that happened, it was in a society that was extraordinarily patriarchal, for example, you have the concept of the individual person. It hasn't yet included women, which is the biggest, but will in turn, and when it does,

it becomes truer to itself, not less true to itself. Okay, that's your understanding of constitutional change. How would you disagree with that?

First of all, I just think that they believed in renewal in a way that we do not. And they feared veneration very gravely. They had fought a very painful revolution full of suffering, especially the suffering of the weakest among them. in order to liberate themselves and found a new nation on principles that they cared about deeply,

and they feared the veneration of themselves as a consequence of the passage of time. Well, I think one should venerate their ideas. Madison says very clearly that... An old constitution will be a dangerous thing, that with the passage of time, it is natural to venerate something that has been around for a long time.

He's obviously right about that. Madison was a brilliant and astute observer of the human heart as well as the human mind. And he feared that. He was concerned about that. It was a problem for him over the course of his own lifetime. They also, you know, Jefferson expected the Constitution to need to be rewritten every 20 years.

He did not believe he fundamentally did not believe that an unborn generation can consent across time to a Constitution that they merely inherit. that that is the dead hand of history and not the consent of the living. It was a really important principle for him. A lot of states,

this is why many states in the United States have pre-scheduled every 10 years, in some cases every 15 years, the question goes to voters, should we have a constitutional convention? Because people believe in this periodicity.

So why didn't the founders put that in the Constitution?

Because they had barely held together the union through the compromises that they had achieved.

So it was impossible.

There is a 20-year expiration date in the amendment clause, right? So we should be able to at least abolish the slave trade after the passage of 20 years. You know, they also recall... They swore a vow to secrecy when they entered that Constitutional Convention in early May of 1787 through the signing day of September 17th,

which will be celebrating the anniversary of soon, 1787, that they nailed the windows shut in that convention hall, in that meeting hall, and they didn't send letters. And they vowed that for 50 years they would never reveal what had taken place there. If they believed, and they abided by that, and this was quite an extraordinary thing,

if they believed that we should be deferring to the conversations they had there that hot summer in Philadelphia, they would surely have not held the proceedings and their details of it well past the death date of most of them.

Why did they do it in private?

They did it in private because they had no authority from Congress to revise, to write a whole new constitution. They had been initially charged to meet in Annapolis in 1786 and not enough to revise the Articles of Confederation or to propose a revision to the Articles of Confederation and not enough delegates showed up.

So they went home and they decided they'd try again and that they were like, next time we're just going to actually... We're just going to go ahead and write a whole new thing. And they just felt like it would be disruptive that summer. That's different from making a 50 year vow of secrecy. Right.

Like these are people who believe in transparency in a deep way. Right. They want the House. They require House proceedings to be open to the public. They really believe in transparency. But what they're doing is unauthorized. And they did. They wanted to get through it.

But they also wanted to avoid it being completely destroyed by public dissension before they got to some compromises, right? Absolutely. Keep it within so that if they have to hammer out some very difficult compromises, their own factions aren't going to rise up against them. So it was partly that as well. Right. But they also, you know,

originalists also refer to the, you know, the records of the state ratifying conventions as dispositive and the meaning of the Constitution. Most of those weren't published for decades and decades. You know, people who were involved in the writing and ratification of the Constitution did not expect that we would be deferring to their writings to interpret it.

But we have to defer to their ideas because their ideas are what channel the thing. And the whole concept of the Constitution is a product of a certain kind of liberalism that we have to understand of the time as well in order to understand why it was done this way, what made this new and different.

And it is a new and different liberal era in which government is restrained primarily as a primary point of a constitution. And yes, that is the core of it. The constitution is preventing the government doing things. Of course, they wanted us to be deferring to that idea in 200, 300 years time, 400 years time.

Is there anyone who is questioning? I'm a historian. This is what I do every day, is try to understand the past and make meaning from it. But that means understanding the ideas. That's different than a judicial philosophy, that we can know nothing else about the world and the circumstances in which we live in order to make decisions.

But that's a strong man.

We defer to a certain set of documents and we can consult no others in order to understand the Constitution.

That's a straw man, that in fact you can give enormous weight to the text of the original text and place that as the primary source. force behind your interpretation of it, and then adjust, as opposed to the idea that every 20 years, all these ideas are up in the air again, we can just start all over,

we can decide otherwise, we want to. Surely the idea of Placing something firm that will last is exactly what they want. They didn't want us to be messing with this all the time completely. Let's have a three-person president. Let's make, you know, I mean, we could do anything.

Andrew, that's a straw man. You have somehow moved to the position of representing my position as wanting a constitutional convention every 20 years to just try anything. Yeah.

What is your position?

How is that a charitable representation? Well,

I don't think... Well, your previous discussion was not a charitable representation of the more conservative position, which is that we should deeply respect the intentions, ideas, and beliefs of the founders in constructing America while trusting them if

necessary. And we shouldn't deeply respect... And inquire into and investigate the less well-recorded ideas of people who were not part of that process, but who had constitutional views at the time and have had ever since, and yet whose political views and preferences exist in a documentary record that we

can now consult to better understand the nature of historical change.

You can better understand the nature of historical change, but you can't change the Constitution. The Constitution was written by those people, not others. And they were guided by certain ideas, not other ideas. And the fact that other people in the country may have not liked those ideas, maybe they wanted to have a new dictator,

maybe they want to have a complete random lottery democracy, all sorts of things. But no, we defer to them. They founded this country. They had a very clear idea of the dangers of government. And yes, it is our absolute duty, it seems to me, not to be obsessive, not to be trying to look into the actual minds,

but to accept the core political philosophy of those people. And that means that... We don't suddenly decide that no one's going to be able to drink in America. We don't suddenly decide that property rights can be thrown up in the air and played with. We don't decide the government can come in and simply say, well,

you can't do this or that because we don't approve morally of what you're doing. It says all those things quite clearly. And if you give that up and say it can all be changed, there has to be a middle ground here.

I just don't see why it is that you don't understand that between us lies not a middle ground, but that we both occupy a middle ground. Why am I on the other side of this cliff, the person who's in your mind saying, well, it just doesn't matter.

They're a bunch of idiots and we can do whatever we want.

Because the book is designed to say, amend, amend, amend, amend, amend, amend. No, it is not. That is a misreading. Tell me what the book is trying to say.

You're very interested in deferring to the original beliefs, commitments, and political philosophy and principles of the framers of the Constitution. And I am insisting that one of those principles was the philosophy of amendment. and that it is a principle that we have abandoned, that it is laying dormant for much of the country's history,

and that that dormancy is a pattern in American history that we should observe. Like, I don't like the Prohibition Amendment. I'm glad it was repealed. You know, it was actually democratically ratified. Like, it passed Congress and it was ratified by the states. So... You know,

there are a lot of things I might not like were people who were the amendment mechanism easier to deploy. That is the risk of living in a democracy. Right. And it is the risk of living in a democracy where we do believe that the people do consent to be governed.

And part of that consent is reserving to themselves and not granting only to the Supreme Court the right to change the Constitution.

So forgive me, because I was confused by the end of the book. What do you believe? Do you think that we should have, should we have a constitutional convention now? What are the things that, you have a final chapter which says the constitution has been made completely irrelevant by climate change. What do you mean by that?

I don't argue anywhere in the book for a constitutional convention. I think there have been really interesting historical arguments made over time for a constitutional convention. I think that the lack of convening, and I don't mean just for a federal convention, but in the states in particular—

is symptomatic of a broader kind of falling away of the practice of some really important skills of citizenship and in democracy. So I kind of I go back to my jury service analogy because I do really mean that. You know, I think if someone were to somehow manage to get enough states to call for Congress

to apply to Congress and we would have a constitutional agreement. convention, people would be rightly, I think, very worried about it. People don't know how to convene anymore. We don't sit down. But you'd be psyched. No, I wouldn't. I'd be worried. I'm not ready to run a marathon. People haven't gotten out of bed in like 50 years.

So, sure, if we'd had a kind of healthy civic culture where people were gathering frequently and your province town meetings were You know, not quiet. People should be arguing about stuff. But where there was a really like a certain amount of decency and respect. Well, there is.

There is there.

If, you know, people regularly did that. And we had a lot of institutions where there was very healthy, open and free debate. face to face in the same room. And we'd revive the practice of state constitutional conventions, even just for minor changes. I think it's like if states have a constitutional convention, they decide not to change anything.

That's a triumph, right? Like, oh, we got together. We went through this exercise. We trusted one another. We decided our constitution is actually great and we don't want to mess with it. That's great by me. My interest is in the active and the capacity of the citizenry to govern themselves.

And that requires the exercise of civic skills that are largely quiescent. So, yes, amendment is is one of them. I don't think the ballot measures, there's a lot of evidence that people often don't know what they're voting for when they vote on a ballot initiative about amending the Constitution. It's kind of quite like fine, whatever.

It's like how states work. So,

OK, so this is helpful to me because I was I was trying to understand why you wrote the book. Why did you write the book?

I wrote the book because I had written this book, These Truths, and it has a lot of constitutional history in it. And it turns out that, well, first of all, there aren't a lot of kind of sweeping accounts of the course of American history. But those that exist tend to have very little constitutional history in them.

There was a, with the kind of revolution in American history in the 60s and 70s, really legal history, constitutional history, even economic history, all moved out of history departments. Like economic historians are in economics departments now, constitutional historians. are in law schools, political historians often are in politics departments. So history, you know,

really kind of became like a lot of social and cultural history, which was a huge revolutionary change. But it meant that, like, I got a lot of email from readers and letters from readers saying, well, I never knew anything about these court cases or the role of the Supreme Court or the history,

like just didn't know anything about the history of constitutionalism. And I really care about constitutionalism and the legitimacy of our constitution. I'm sure that we share that. And so I thought, oh, well, I should do more incorporating constitutional history into my teaching. And then I wanted to think about I wanted to have a mock constitutional convention

as a pedagogical exercise, like just as a good way to help people think about, like, do we have the constitution we want or whatever? And I'm sorry, it's a very long answer, but so I wanted to give my students an assignment, which was like,

if you want to let's say you want to introduce the word God into the Constitution, you want to propose an amendment to do that or you want to ban birthright citizenship or you want to constitutionalize same sex marriage or, you know, whatever it is that you want to do.

You have to write a white paper as a delegation and you have to explain the history of similar efforts. Like how has anyone proposed the thing you want to do before? And I was like, obviously, this will be very easy. They can just go into it. There's got to be a database of every amendment attempt.

And there wasn't.

And there wasn't. So I got a grant from the NEH to build one, really, just for the sake of I figured other people would. would want this it is a middle school exercise like it is fascinating and i think

the i the concept of trying to do your own i think it's a brilliant one you should people should do it yeah it's really really interesting it requires you to think about first principles it requires you to think about where it requires you to

understand what works as well as what doesn't work right i mean i think and i think

that's where maybe there's a miss between your perception of of of my caring about a constitution or amendment or conventions is like, it's fine. It's you, if you have a constitutional convention with your students, like, like by definition, half what they're doing is arguing against change,

right?

They're going to be arguing against everybody else's trying to win theirs. So it is actually just about the, the, the, the war it's about the work, right? It's about the constitutional thinking and putting some skin in the game and being willing to defend, um, the status quo, to argue for its change.

And that is... I just think that's really important work. So I set up this database and it turned out to be really interesting. And I came across some article written by this guy who had done this like in the 1890s. He wanted to do a century of... He compiled the...

He wrote a dissertation on the century of efforts to amend the Constitution. And he says at some point, like, it turns out after having doing this work, I really feel like these this century of whatever, however many failed amendments is a sort of an index of the political desires of the American people, not necessarily the constitutional desires,

because actually often people are proposing things that are this really better achieved by legislation. You know, a lot of people's constitutional ideas are really just legislative ideas. But I actually kind of came to think that I learned a lot about, you know, over the course of the 250 years since the first state constitutions.

you can learn a lot about what people have wanted.

Yeah, yeah.

And you might say, and I think you can defend your position, obviously, that that's irrelevant to how the court should interpret the Constitution. And I think that's what originalists would say. It's very good history, maybe, or maybe it's a mediocre history, or maybe it's crappy, whatever. Or it's political theory. But it doesn't matter to me about,

it shouldn't matter to the people in the Supreme Court building. Well, I disagree with that, but the project, in any case, was it offering, trying to sort of offer up a broader history of Americans' constitutional ideas?

Yes, and I think I was fascinated. I was fascinated by the fact that many of the things we're discussing today have always been discussed. I'm fascinated by the interaction of ideas with just practical realities, compromises that people had to make. Yeah, and that really helps me understand better what you were aiming at.

I obviously think there's – when I think of, for example, where the Warren Court was, which was sort of at the far end of national legislation, really, in some respects – And then I think of the current court or the Scalia position, which seems to me to be a reactionary one, put it that way.

I do think that those two things were actually healthy to counterpoise each other, that those two things actually helped create a bit of a balance. And my reading of the last like 50 years or so is that Aren't laws in states, passing laws in states, the best way to govern ourselves?

Is going into the Constitution really something that we should be thinking about as opposed to getting on with changing things at our local level, at our state level, where we understand the world?

You know, I think there's incredible vitality in the states. And it is the close, you know, people are closer to their legislators. They know them often, right? You know the person you elect to your state legislature. You have a capacity to understand that you are part of that government. And this was always a concern, right?

This is the Federalist 10 concern. And Madison very cleverly defeats it. Like, okay, we can't have a big republic. It'll be okay. Yeah. I care about that argument, but we're living in a world where Much of what you and I have discussed here is sort of to one side,

because constitutional change is happening largely by fiat at this moment in American history, where the executive, you know, the current occupant of the White House says it's constitutional if I say it's constitutional. And nothing could be further if you care about the attention of the framers. And surely we should care.

Nothing could be further than the precision of the mechanism for separation of powers and checks and balances that is the Constitution.

And this is why, as an old-school sort of conservative constitutionalist, I'm so hostile to Trump, which I think is the coherent, consistent position. The book is a fascinating insight into how Americans have thought about reconceiving their politics and their lives. It has all sorts of things I'd never read before.

It's also a very helpful way to just get you to think through, how does change happen in America? And the idea of constitutional conventions is one of those things, one of those civic things, is something that was fresh to me and I think is really helpful. Thank you. Jill, for writing that book.

Thank you for your previous book, which I loved, as you know. And thanks for the spirited debate about the role of the founders.

Yes, thank you for that. That is always a good time. I'm glad we drew out our differences, but we also found commonalities.

We do, we do, we do. But I come from political theory, you see. So I'm obsessed with the ideas behind the founders and those ideas remaining relevant because they're about human nature. in ways that are timeless. So a historian is going to come at this from a very different point of view,

and I think both are helpful to people. Thank you, Jill. Thank you for listening. Just a reminder, Charles Murray and Katie Herzog. are coming on the show. We have many more exciting discussions, Trump's mental health we're going to talk about, and many other things to come. So thank you so much. Thanks for subscribing.

I hope you have a lovely weekend in this Indian summer, and we'll see you all next week.
