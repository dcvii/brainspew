### Day 17

I discovered Urbit today. I have always been here. I have just discovered the other people who think like me. I'm not trying to be afraid that this is very much what I've been all about for quite some time, but I think perhaps I can have some cred as these entities get to know me. This is day 17, arbitrarily, of my new engergy and dedication to building this world I have envisioned. I am so pleased to find that Urbit suits my purposes rather exactly as I had hoped someone would. So I'm there. I'll let you know what planet I'm on as soon as I understand this universe a little bit better.
