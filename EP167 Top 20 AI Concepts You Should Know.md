## WorkOS: Scoped Access and Control for AI Agents (Sponsored)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424)

AI agents can trigger tools, call APIs, and access sensitive data.  
Failing to control access creates real risk.

Learn how to:

- Limit what agents can do with scoped tokens
- Define roles and restrict permissions
- Log activity for debugging and review
- Secure credentials and secrets
- Detect and respond to suspicious behavior

Real teams are applying these practices to keep agent workflows safe, auditable, and aligned with least-privilege principles.

## The AI Application Stack for Building RAG Apps

![graphical user interface, application](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424)

graphical user interface, application

1. Large Language Models  
	These are the core engines behind Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), responsible for understanding queries and generating coherent and contextual responses. Some common LLM options are OpenAI GPT models, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen 2.5, Gemma, etc.
2. Frameworks and Model Access  
	These tools simplify the integration of LLMs into your applications by handling prompt orchestration, model switching, memory, chaining, and routing. Common tools are Langchain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, Ollama, Hugging Face, and OpenRouter.
3. Databases  
	RAG applications rely on storing and retrieving relevant information. These vector databases are optimized for similarity search, while relational options like Postgres offer structured storage. Tools are Postgres, FAISS, Milvus, pgVector, Weaviate, Pinecone, Chroma, etc.
4. Data Extraction  
	To populate your knowledge base, these tools help extract structured information from unstructured sources like PDFs, websites, and APIs. Some common tools are Llamaparse, Docking, Megaparser, Firecrawl, ScrapeGraph AI, Document AI, and Claude API.
5. Text Embeddings  
	Embeddings convert text into high-dimensional vectors that enable semantic similarity search, which is a critical step for connecting queries with relevant context in RAG. Common tools are Nomic, OpenAI, Cognita, Gemini, LLMWare, Cohere, JinaAI, and Ollama.

Over to you: What else will you add to the list to build RAG apps?

## Shopify Tech Stacks and Tools

Shopify handles scale that would break most systems.

![](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/801cc519-68cc-4e1d-88b6-b9821b5e6b52_1222x1600.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:1600,%22width%22:1222,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:null,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:null,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:null,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false%7D)

On a single day (Black Friday 2024), the platform processed 173 billion requests, peaked at 284 million requests per minute, and pushed 12 terabytes of traffic every minute through its edge.

These numbers arenâ€™t anomalies. Theyâ€™re sustained targets that Shopify strives to meet. Behind this scale is a stack that looks deceptively simple from the outside: Ruby on Rails, React, MySQL, and Kafka.

But that simplicity hides sharp architectural decisions, years of refactoring, and thousands of deliberate trade-offs.  
  
In this newsletter, we map the tech stack powering Shopify from:

- the modular monolith that still runs the business,
- to the pods that isolate failure domains,
- to the deployment pipelines that ship hundreds of changes a day.
- It covers the tools, programming languages, and patterns Shopify uses to stay fast, resilient, and developer-friendly at incredible scale.

A huge thank you to Shopifyâ€™s world-class engineering team for sharing their insights and for collaborating with us on this deep technical exploration.
