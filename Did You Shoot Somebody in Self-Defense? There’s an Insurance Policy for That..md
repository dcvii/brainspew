## Rise in gun ownership and stand-your-ground laws drives a lucrative new market to insulate shooters from criminal and civil liability

Just after 2 a.m. on a November night, police were called to the home of Joshua Huston to respond to a shooting. Huston had camped out with his AR-15 rifle on a lot he owned next to his Florida home, hoping to catch the person who had been stealing from the property.

He says he was startled awake by a man a few feet away. The man, holding something shiny, started yelling. Fearing for his life, Huston fired several times. The intruder ran away, bleeding.

What happened next shows the benefits—and pitfalls—of a fast-growing insurance market catering to gun owners who want protection if they kill or injure in self-defense.

Rushing back to his house, Huston followed the directions on a "Post Incident" card from the U.S. Concealed Carry Association. While he called 911, his wife was on the company’s 24-hour hotline.

Within an hour, a USCCA attorney called to represent him.

But after Huston was arrested and charged with attempted murder, he says the USCCA lawyer told him the case was a difficult one and advised him to plead guilty to a lesser charge. He went out and found a new lawyer, who got the charges dismissed. Even though USCCA also paid for the new lawyer, Huston quit his membership shortly after the two-year legal saga ended.

“I knew I was innocent—there was no way I was going to take a guilty plea,” said Huston, a 49-year old disabled Air Force veteran.

The number of Americans buying self-defense insurance—dubbed “murder insurance” by critics who believe it can encourage the use of deadly force—has soared in recent years.

About two million people have signed up, according to industry executives, some of whom estimate their membership has doubled in the past five years.

The insurers offer a range of services, including bail and criminal-defense lawyers. Some also cover the cost of litigating civil lawsuits brought by victims of the shootings.

The policies aren’t limited to shooting incidents; most companies will cover a member charged with other crimes, such as threatening somebody with a gun, so long as there’s a plausible self-defense claim.

Many companies offer upgraded plans that can include crime-scene cleanup costs (in-home or vehicle), TSA-violation expenses, accidental-discharge costs and coverage for spouses and minor children.

USCCA and rival U.S. Law Shield are the industry giants, but there are about a half dozen midsize and small players. They charge monthly fees ranging from about $11 to $59.

The companies’ marketing campaigns, which sometimes involve gun giveaways, include video testimonials from satisfied customers who shot in self-defense and got off, usually with no penalty. “There’s literally thousands of cases that have gone to trial that we have defended our members and exonerated them from charges,” said Tim Schmidt, USCCA’s founder and owner.

The fine print of their policies, however, shows the companies usually have wide latitude to reject a member’s claim, sometimes launching their own investigations to decide if it is legitimate. Some plans won’t cover a member who is intoxicated during an incident, or if it involves shooting a family member. Many restrict members to their own stable of attorneys.

USCCA’s policy says coverage ends if a member claims self-defense but is convicted of a violent crime. The policy also says its insurer can claw back legal fees or other expenses—although the company says it never has done so.

As for the case involving Huston, the Florida homeowner, USCCA said members have the right to choose their own lawyers, and “in Joshua’s case, he exercised that right by selecting new counsel.” USCCA said it couldn’t comment on any conversations between Huston and the first lawyer, but said plea deals by members charged with a crime are “extremely rare.”

The growth in self-defense insurance is linked to a rise in gun ownership, stand-your-ground laws and more states allowing residents to carry concealed firearms in public without a permit. The industry got a major boost when gun buying surged amid racial unrest in 2020, after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

Often falling between regulatory cracks, the fast-growing industry is governed by few rules and faces limited financial-disclosure requirements.

Several states, notably New York and Washington, have taken legal action to halt the sale of self-defense coverage, in some cases arguing the product runs afoul of laws that prohibit insuring intentional illegal acts.

Some companies say their products aren’t insurance at all, but prepaid legal plans or membership organizations that aren’t subject to the same regulatory oversight. U.S. Law Shield operates as an insurer in some states and a prepaid legal plan in others. It says it follows all state regulations.

The companies are also highly profitable, often spending only a small fraction of their revenue on defending clients, a Wall Street Journal review of available insurance filings and other industry data shows. USCCA’s owner, who lives in Wisconsin, owns three private jets, according to federal aviation records.

Some attribute their low case numbers to success in educating and training members on when—and when not—to use force.

Armed Citizens’ Legal Defense Network, based in Centralia, Wash., charges $150 annually for initial membership, with a discount for renewals. As of year-end 2024, it said it had more than 22,000 members but over the prior 17 years had covered only 35 cases costing less than $325,000 in total. It has rejected several claims.

On its website, the company attributes its low number of cases to its careful membership demographic and “vigorous member education initiative.”

Houston-based U.S. Law Shield, an industry pioneer that started in Texas in 2009 and now operates in 46 states, says it has about 600,000 to 700,000 members paying $10.95 to $54.90 a month, plus another 300,000 to 400,000 spouses and minor children added to plans by members.

The company doesn’t disclose its financials, but insurance filings for two of its entities that operate in Florida and Virginia show they spent about 15% of revenue on legal expenses to cover member claims in recent years.

Medical and professional-liability insurers, by contrast, generally spend about 60% to 75% of their premium revenue on direct claims losses, according to ratings firm AM Best.

“The number of people who ended up with charges is minuscule. That’s why they made so much money,” said Stanley Marks, a now-retired Denver attorney who was under contract to represent U.S. Law Shield members from 2013 to 2020.

Kirk Evans, president of U.S. Law Shield, said the cost of defending members in some states exceeds revenues, and when including other expenses such as member training and education the company’s loss ratio is in line with many insurers’. Even so, he said, “we’re very profitable.”

Evans said the company’s lawyers spend time and money representing members who shot somebody but don’t get indicted. About 30 to 35 members a month end up with criminal charges, he said, including incidents where a member is charged with threatening someone with a weapon. The “vast majority” of cases end in dismissals or acquittals, he said, with fewer than 10% taking plea deals.

Evans said some members have successfully filed multiple claims. “We’ve had plenty of repeat customers,” he said. Some have had three or four separate incidents, he said.

U.S. Law Shield is 100% owned by Houston attorney Darren Rice. The company says a costly criminal trial in the Houston area was a catalyst for Rice to start the company in 2009, then called Texas Law Shield. The case involved a suburban Houston retiree who went broke after paying legal fees following his killing of two men he believed were trying to burglarize his neighbor’s home. The retiree was cleared by a grand jury.

“Even if you’re totally right, and even if you’re eventually acquitted, you end up spending tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars,” said Evans, the U.S. Law Shield president.

A case involving a USCCA member in Wisconsin shows how self-defense coverage can affect the criminal-justice system.

Stanley Scott was allegedly beaten up, stunned with a Taser and handcuffed outside a Madison, Wis., bar by two men in 2019, following an altercation, according to police reports and court filings. Both men were charged criminally.

One of the alleged assailants, a security guard at the bar with a criminal record, was a USCCA member. Months after the incident, the guard allegedly told a friend of the victim that Scott was lucky he was only shot with a Taser and said a court case stemming from the incident “ain’t costing me no money,” according to a police report.

The security guard’s lawyer denies his client said that and says he had a strong self-defense case. But the lawyer also says he mentioned the USCCA insurance to Scott’s attorney, pointing out that if the security guard were convicted, the insurer per its policy wouldn’t pay any settlement in the civil case.

“This guy has no assets and my client would like to be financially compensated,” said Scott’s attorney, Jeff Scott Olson, who says he asked prosecutors to drop charges against the security guard. They did.

Nearly three years after the altercation, Scott filed a civil lawsuit seeking damages. USCCA’s insurer paid a confidential settlement, said Olson, who said it was “into six figures.”

“Was it sort of a back channel way to resolve a case?” said the security guard’s attorney, Mark Maciolek, who was paid by USCCA. “Sure.”

Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said the man’s potential insurance was brought up, but the main reason for the dismissal was video evidence showing no criminal conduct. The other defendant pleaded guilty to false imprisonment and received three years’ probation.

USCCA said criminal-defense decisions “are left entirely to the member and their defense attorney.”

### Fear factor

Controversy and civil unrest have been good for self-defense insurers, especially in 2020, a year that saw a contentious presidential election and unrest after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.

Federal data show required background checks to possess a firearm rose to more than 39 million in 2020, up 40% from the prior year.

“The whole industry exploded in 2020 and 2021, with all the social unrest and riots,” said Kent Brown, president of CCW Safe, an Oklahoma-based provider of self-defense coverage. He said his firm’s membership more than doubled in the past five years and is now between 100,000 and 150,000 members.

David Edmondson of Dunsmuir, Calif., said the post-George Floyd unrest spurred him to sign up with U.S. Law Shield in 2020. He would need the coverage about six weeks later.

Owner of a sauerkraut business, Edmondson traveled to sell his product at a farmers market in Sacramento in early July 2020 and was sleeping in his van to save money. A man tried to break in with what appeared to be a two-by-four around 2 a.m. He said despite warning the man away, the intruder busted his van windows with the piece of wood and hit him on the head with it after entering the vehicle.

“I told him I had my weapon, and he mocked it,” said Edmondson, 60. “The next time he leaned in, that was when I used my gun.”

He fired one round, striking the man in his forehead. He then dialed 911 and reported the shooting, but didn’t stay on long before calling a U.S. Law Shield toll-free number for help. The suspect, who was 32, died at the scene, according to a police report.

A U.S. Law Shield-appointed attorney represented Edmondson and no charges were filed.

USCCA, likely the largest in the industry with 860,000 members, is 100% owned by founder Tim Schmidt and his ex-wife, regulatory filings show. Schmidt’s self-published memoir says he worked as an engineer before starting “Concealed Carry” magazine in the early 2000s. The company got into the self-defense insurance business in 2011, he wrote.

The West Bend, Wis.-based company currently charges from $39 to $59 a month for Gold, Platinum and Elite membership. All levels now come with the same self-defense coverage; higher monthly fees entitle a member to more training.

Based on a membership breakdown and other information provided by USCCA, the Journal estimated the company’s membership revenue in 2024 was about $300 million.

USCCA says it spends a lot on firearms education and member training, amounting to more than $100 million in 2024. “We’re the No. 1 firearms and self-defense training organization in the country,” Schmidt said.

What it doesn’t spend a lot on is self-defense legal costs.

USCCA says members’ self-defense needs are insured through Universal Fire & Casualty Insurance, simply described on the USCCA website as “an insurance company with its principal place of business in Hudsonville, MI.”

The amount USCCA pays the insurer isn’t publicly available, but analysts looking at the insurer’s books say the maximum it could have been in 2024 was between $31 million and $47 million, a fraction of USCCA’s estimated 2024 membership revenue.

That range is actually too high, Schmidt said in an interview. “To me, that sounds excessive,” he said, while declining to provide specifics.

USCCA doesn’t disclose this, but Schmidt and his ex-wife also own 79% of the insurance company, according to a chart buried deep in the insurer’s state regulatory filings. Another Schmidt company owns three private jets.

USCCA said the Schmidts bought the insurer to protect gun owners, at a time when insurers were pulling out of the industry due to political pressure.

It says the jets were purchased as an investment and are leased out to a third party for use in charter flights, which sometimes include the Schmidt family.

### Planning ahead

Prosecutors have cited instances when defendants have purchased self-defense insurance before committing crimes. Such was the case with Kayla Jean Giles Coutee, a Louisiana mother in a contentious custody dispute with her estranged husband, Thomas Coutee, Jr.

Giles Coutee bought a gun on Aug. 27, 2018, and that same day also signed up for insurance from USCCA—getting its midlevel platinum plan, which at the time offered up to $150,000 in criminal-defense expense.

She had researched self-defense insurance online and also messaged a friend saying she’d deleted her social-media accounts, could make the news and might need a fundraiser for bail money, court records show.

Twelve days after getting the gun and insurance, she met Coutee in a [Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/WMT) parking lot in Alexandria, La., to hand off two of her children. Giles Coutee pulled out a gun while sitting in her car and shot her estranged husband in the chest. He died. She alleged that Coutee jerked open her car door, she feared for her life and shot him in self-defense, according to court documents.

While still at the scene, Giles Coutee contacted USCCA to report the incident. USCCA’s insurer at the time initially paid a $50,000 retainer for Giles’ criminal defense attorney.

But after a fuller review, the insurer denied the claim, saying the matter didn’t involve an act of self-defense. Giles Coutee filed a lawsuit to receive the remaining $100,000 in criminal-defense funding.

The lawsuit was dismissed after she was found guilty of second-degree murder and obstruction of justice. She received a life sentence plus 30 years. Her conviction is on appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court.

USCCA was criticized by industry rivals and some in the gun-owner community for dropping Giles Coutee. “People felt like it really wasn’t insurance, and they were misleading people,” said Rocky Willson, one of Giles Coutee’s attorneys.

“Out of thousands of cases, this was the only one in company history in which coverage was withdrawn during trial,” USCCA said.

In the Florida case, the man shot by Huston in his lot survived. The man, who was homeless and had a criminal record, claimed he had yelled “don’t shoot” and was turning away at the time Huston shot him. The police seemed to buy his side of the story.

Not long after the November 2022 shooting the man sued Huston and USCCA for damages.

Huston, who was sure he shot in self-defense, says he was shocked that his USCCA-recommended lawyer suggested he plead guilty to attempted manslaughter, a felony. According to USCCA’s policy that would have ended his coverage.

“I would have owed the money back for the $10,000 bond, and all the legal fees, and the civil lawsuit as well,” Huston says. “It wasn’t right.”

USCCA’s insurer rebuffed his request for a new lawyer, saying it was still investigating his claim, but later relented. The new attorney filed a motion to dismiss the charges based on Florida’s so-called stand your ground law. In December 2024, a judge agreed and dismissed the case.

USCCA said its insurer settled the civil suit on undisclosed terms, on the recommendation of Huston’s attorney.

Huston wouldn’t provide details except that “it’s a lot of money for this guy.”
