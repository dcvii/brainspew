**Jeff Bezos** @JeffBezos [2025-02-26](https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088)

I shared this note with the Washington Post team this morning:

I‚Äôm writing to let you know about a change coming to our opinion pages.

We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We‚Äôll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.

There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader‚Äôs doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.

I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America‚Äôs success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical ‚Äî it minimizes coercion ‚Äî and practical ‚Äî it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity.

I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhell yes,‚Äù then it had to be ‚Äúno.‚Äù After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won‚Äôt be easy, and it will require 100% commitment ‚Äî I respect his decision. We‚Äôll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.

I‚Äôm confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America. I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I‚Äôm excited for us together to fill that void.

Jeff

Thank you! Every op-ed page has some editorial line. There are enough sources out there to get anti-market views. The free market has proved itself time and time again, and the marketplace of ideas has not done nearly enough to give it its due.

Given the opportunity to lead an organization that comments on freedom and individual liberty...

@davidjshipley says: NO.

Because what leftist would want to discuss free markets and individual liberty?

How it started: "I promise to never interfere with the editorial decisions of the Washington Post.‚Äú

How it‚Äôs going: "If you don‚Äôt like my editorial decisions l then it‚Äôs time for you to go."

The Washington Post is the official newspaper of the government. It shouldn‚Äôt have any opinion page at all as public officials aren‚Äôt allowed to write opinions

This should be easy

1\. "What is personal liberty and why is Trump destroying it?"

2\. "Free markets: Threat or danger?"

Jeff,

The WashPost Editorial Board criticized my DOGE Dividend proposal on Monday. They have refused to give me the opportunity to respond to their largely baseless arguments. Can you help?
