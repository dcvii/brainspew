As Donald Trump assumes office today, he inherits a targeted killing program that has been the cornerstone of U.S. counterterrorism strategy over the past eight years. On January 23, 2009, just three days into his presidency, President Obama authorized his first kinetic military action: two drone strikes, three hours apart, in Waziristan, Pakistan, that killed [as many as twenty civilians](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/08/10/obama-2009-strikes/ "as many as twenty civilians"). Two terms and 540 strikes later, Obama leaves the White House after having vastly expanding and normalizing the use of armed drones for counterterrorism and close air support operations in non-battlefield settings—namely Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia.

Throughout his presidency, I have written often about Obama’s [legacy as a drone president](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/01/12/reflecting-on-obamas-presidency/obamas-embrace-of-drone-strikes-will-be-a-lasting-legacy "legacy as a drone president"), including reports on how the United States could [reform drone strike policies](http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736 "reform drone strike policies"), what were the benefits of [transferring CIA drone strikes](http://www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/p30434 "transferring CIA drone strikes") to the Pentagon, and (with Sarah Kreps) how to [limit armed drone proliferation](http://www.cfr.org/drones/limiting-armed-drone-proliferation/p33127 "limit armed drone proliferation"). President Obama deserves credit for even acknowledging the existence of the targeted killing program (something his predecessor did not do), and for increasing transparency into the internal processes that purportedly guided the authorization of drone strikes. However, many needed reforms were left undone—in large part because there was zero pressure from congressional members, who, with few exceptions, were the biggest cheerleaders of drone strikes.

On the first day of the Trump administration, it is too early to tell what changes he could implement. However, most of his predecessor’s reforms have either been voluntary, like the release of [two](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/DNI+Release+on+CT+Strikes+Outside+Areas+of+Active+Hostilities.PDF "two") [reports](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Summary%20of%202016%20Information%20Regarding%20United%20States%20Counterterrorism%20Strikes%20Outside%20Areas%20of%20Active%20Hostilities.pdf "reports") totaling the number of strikes and both combatants and civilians killed, or [executive guidelines](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download "executive guidelines") that could be ignored with relative ease. Should he opt for an even more expansive and intensive approach, little would stand in his way, except for Democrats in Congress, who might have newfound concerns about the president’s war-making powers. Or perhaps citizens and investigative journalists, who may resist efforts to undermine transparency, accountability, and oversight mechanisms.

Less than two weeks ago, the United States conducted a drone strike over central Yemen, killing one al-Qaeda operative. The strike was the [last under Obama](http://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/1048880/us-central-command-announces-recent-strikes-in-yemen/ "last under Obama") (that we know of). The 542 drone strikes that Obama authorized killed an estimated 3,797 people, including 324 civilians. As he [reportedly told](https://books.google.com/books?id=YcDiIW-5KvYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=double+down+book&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi_oI_cl9HRAhWJyoMKHRYRDvQQ6AEIIzAA#v=snippet&q=%22Turns%20out%20I%E2%80%99m%20really%20good%20at%20killing%20people%22&f=false "reportedly told") senior aides in 2011: “Turns out I’m really good at killing people. Didn’t know that was gonna be a strong suit of mine.”

Backgrounder

This week I sat down with Dr. Jason Matheny, director of the [Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity](https://www.iarpa.gov/ "Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity") (IARPA). IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research programs to address national intelligence problems, from language recognition software to forecasting tournaments to evaluate strategies to “predict” the future. Dr. Matheny shed light on how IARPA selects cutting-edge research projects and how its work helps ensure intelligence guides sound decision- and policymaking. He also offers his advice to young scientists just starting their careers.

Listen to a fascinating conversation with the leader of one of the coolest research organizations in the U.S. government, and follow IARPA on Twitter [@IARPANews](https://twitter.com/IARPAnews "@IARPANews").
