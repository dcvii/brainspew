I’m positively disposed to anything that makes the Iranian mullahs’ lives worse because of what they’ve done to that poor nation.

That didn’t mean I’m confident that Trump did the right thing. When you move into uncharted territory, the outcomes are inherently uncertain.

But there’s an old quote I wave around. Here’s John Gaddis, talking about the Cold War in his book of the same title - The Cold War: A New History, talking about Reagan’s “why not win” stance:

“A kind of moral anesthesia settled in, leaving the stability of the Soviet-American relationship to be valued over its fairness because the alternative was too frightening to contemplate. Once it became clear that everybody was in the same lifeboat, hardly anyone wanted to rock it.

The moral ambivalence was not moral equivalence. the United States never found it necessary to violate human rights on the scale that the Soviet Union, its Eastern European allies, and the Chinese under Mao Zedong had done. But Washington officials had long since convinced themselves that the only way they could prevent those violations was to go to war, a prospect that could only make things much worse.”

Diplomats aren’t immune to public-choice dilemmas.
