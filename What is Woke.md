 This is Michael David Cobb Bowen, and today I'm going to extemporaneously handle a question. What is woke ? What is woke? Woke is an aspect of social justice movement, and the social justice is crowdsourced. , which is the whining little sister of mob rule. So let's get behind this and get into it and understand my particular angle of opposing, excuse me, at the woke.


First of all, let me say that I am very well persuaded and in 90% agreement with the two following experts when it comes to opposition to woke activism. The first is John McWhorter, and the second is Helen Pluckrose of Counterweight.

  

I believe somewhere around five or six years ago. Their aim was to combat the double speak of post-modernists. And I'm an engineer and I have spent a lot of time trying to understand the arts.

  

And I would say that temperamentally I'm a scholar. , but I chose not to go into academia. I chose to go into science and technology because I understood that I'd be on the cutting edge of discovery of new things, and I didn't like the idea of art criticism where I would be debating old things.

  

understanding there are new things like films and sculptures and production of art that's happening all the time. But my temperament led me more towards the sciences and technologies. Even as an engineer, I wanted to understand the logic and the frameworks of the arts and letters.

  

And so I spent a lot of time, having mastered what I needed for my profession, to join what I call the chatting class. And I did so in a novel way which is I wrote on the internet. So rather than writing for, let's say, the three penny review or trying to get a poem of mine in the New Yorker, I wrote blogs and formed blog leagues that were notable, et cetera, et cetera.

  

Helen Pluckrose and her fellows were able to use their double speak to, to beat the editors of this academic journal. It was clear to me that there was some crisis in reason in American universities, and this was something that piqued my interest.

  

Because in general, I have noticed the decline of civility and the marginalization of highbrow in the American Arts and letters. And so I say, does this threaten me? And in a way it does. I'll just say in one way, I don't like the idea of being misrepresented.  as someone who listens to gangster rap or who sees that lifestyle as something attractive in any particular way.

  

So nobody wants to be stereotyped, but also nobody wants to to. Lowbrow, vulgarity. So I conceptualized that the counterculture of America accepted this vulgarity. . And it's interesting that I would go and reference because we've been thinking about this recently. Norman Mailer's essay, the White Negro.

  

So basically Mailer stereotyped the Negro in America. This was published in 1957 as this kind of low life degenerate sexual brute and characterized the dharma bums and the counterculture hippies of the movement as the white Negroes. They were trying to be the lowbrow lowlife non-intellectual that he perceived the American negro to be.

  

And so this is, an old trope about black culture. At any rate if. For myself and for my family. We never lived like that and we we didn't embrace any of that culture, but that kind of thing goes on and you can expect that there is this kind of lowbrow black culture that some black Americans actually love and participate and they're doing what they want to do.

  

So the question.  in the university setting where people are supposed to be scholars, where are the artistic scholars that are saying we clearly understand that black Americans have done more than just this lowbrow stuff. But there are others, who, who would want to make the case that pig meat Markham, with his sexual double entendres or Redd Foxx with his double entendres were just masking what everybody knows about the Negroes and their sexuality. And you can you can like Pig beat Markham and be titillated by if you can understand his accent, cuz I I have some trouble listening to him and moms maybe.

  

But I get it. My point is when we talk about the woke, I think they are being essentialist. And I think they are doing this for the cause of social justice because they perceive the black community as all of an oppressed piece. And they believe that they're doing something in favor of the black community without really understanding who black Americans are in their own diversity.

  

I'm talking about black American diversity. In, I like to quote that in, in 1960 there were 20 million Negroes, and most of them were.  And now it's 2023, almost 70, 73 years later, or 63 years later. And or 46 million African Americans or black Americans would, I prefer the term black Americans.

  

And the majority are middle class. And so the question is if. Black Americans or African Americans throughout history have strive to be recognized as the diverse individuals that they are, rather than chunked into a class. Then you have to respect them as they represent themselves. And the problem of course has been that when it comes to matters of cultural product the large mainstream media companies and anyone who's in the business of cultural production can certainly have more power than an organic organization.

  

So if, for example,

  

you're August Wilson and you're writing plays about black life in the forties and fifties, And they don't get produced to the mainstream television audiences until who knows when. I guess when did Denzel Washington do fences finally this century. Certainly not last century when it was written.

  

If there's a 40, 50 year lag between. When the writer creates an artifact of cultural production and it actually gets into the mainstream that's a big gap. And so you have to assume that the class differences within Black America are not gonna reach the public. And since we're a smaller number of people, what's the opportunity for the average American to understand something about Black America and the various classes and distinctions between them?

  

That's my angle and my angle comes from a personal kind of thing, understanding that I grew up in Los Angeles and I was nothing like boys in the hood. And so here you have a singular.  Black graduate from the USC Film School, who gets the opportunity to make a film and the biggest stars that come out of there, aside from Denzel Washington and Angela Bassett and those of that stripe, including I would Courtney Vance Courtney b Vance and several others that I could name, but don't think about that much.

  

is that you have this cultural production of quote unquote the black culture that comes out gangster and Ice Cube would be another one. Dre, Snoop Dogg. All these guys who are, millionaires in their fifties. So the question.

  

How do bad ideas, how does vulgar culture become the pre dominating view of a segment of America and where you could look in other cases, for example, like the armed forces where black Americans are overrepresented it shows their interest. And what I want to talk about is the disjoint between

  

what essentialist projections dominate the woke view of black America versus who Black America actually is. And it's relatively easy for me to do so and see that because I've been a black conservative I've gone to Catholic school. I'm an engineer. I come from a family that is part evangelical.

  

I would say my mother  on my mother's side, she's a lapsed. . And then if you are a lapsed Catholic, you could go anywhere. And she's gone through the four Foursquare evangelicals. She was a Seventh Day Adventist, and now she just joined a new church and I'm not exactly sure which one that is. And then my father who grew up in the Episcopal Church not the African Methodist, Episcopal, the Straight Episcopal Church in New England.

  

And then let that aside for a while, then rejoined it. So for me I grew up in a what they call unequally yoked family of Christians. And we have people who in the family who lived abroad. So it's easy for me to see a different side of black.  than most people see, and it's difficult.

  

Reflecting on what I've been talking about, cultural production for every other Americans to understand this particular niche I like to say that for example, if you know anything about the author John Cheever, then you could say there. Call me the Black John Cheever. It's weird because I haven't read John Cheever, but I understand he talks about the dysfunctions of the upscale WASP community that we don't talk about anymore.

  

We don't talk about wasps of New England.

  

But certainly they still exist. They may not be as influential as they once were, but there are people who. . And I know because my, my, my sister has worked at Brown University and lives in Providence, Rhode Island right now. And a significant, I have a cousin and an aunt who live in New Haven, Connecticut, not far from Yale where my grandfather worked.

  

So there. Real black diversity in America among the 46, nearly 50 million of us that, that are here. And there is no single perspective that defines that. None. Because you have to understand on the third part that race is a fiction and that it is an unscientific fiction. It is. Something that can find sustainability within a post-modern discourse where people want it to have meaning and then imbue it with meaning.

  

So you could say that there's like a cryptocurrency called blackness and there's no real value behind it. But if people want to have value behind it, you can play that suckers game. And there's a lot of PT Barn.  in the race game in America. And it's exacerbated by this era of woke in which corporate entities can decide to market themselves as esg and they can put together haphazardly a d EI program.

  

Which, which  attempts to to put lipstick on a corporate culture, which may or may not be inclusive enough. But what I so I came to this controversy from the perspective of what is rational in society and what is. And that had to do with the candidacy and presidential administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump.

  

And as much as I have gone back and understood the philosophy of Western thinking in America as illustrated by a book by Cornell West called the American Invasion of.  I found in Emerson particularly every value that I wanted. So I could read Emerson through Cornell West and say, oh, yeah, this is what I want, and I could read the life of John Brown and a Frederick Douglass and say, yeah, that's the vision of America that I believe.

  

and I don't have to go to Africa or Europe or anyplace else to find what it is that I really want to, what I really believe in and what I would put my life behind. So I didn't get into, even though members of my family certainly entertained the possibility of leaving America because they felt that there was no hope for the Negro.

  

And certainly we embrace certain Pan-African ideas. You look at the ideas, you see how they work and you make a choice. But I looked at the American invasion of philosophy and I said, okay, yeah, this is this makes sense. Not all the way through, not everyone was as appealing to me.

  

Particularly Emerson, but it made sense with my understanding of Christianity. It made sense with my understanding of liberty. It made sense in terms of what I thought the American dream should be. And so again, I did that. I read the Declaration of Independence and I said, oh, I understand the. , I understand the complaint, and I think that if there had been a black writer, a negro writer, or a colored writer in that process, then racism in America would be as prohibited as monarchy in America.

  

And it was a complaint against monarchy. For what it was an excellent document. There's no doubt about that. But you can see the idea of a complaint of the things intention there. And I says, okay, that, that makes sense as well. And then I understood quite clearly that in delineating the rights of man, as such as you can understand them, that someone like John Brown understood very clearly as.

  

Most the agri the educated colored people as well as people in bondage. You don't have to tell a slave that he's a slave. He understands that, and he certainly understands the notion of freedom. So within the moral universe, America provided all that I needed. The question then was, , it's a method of how, it's a question of how do you secure these liberties?

  

And

  

I recognize that within a countercultural movement of America, this was a rejection of America. And it was a rejection of its society. It was a rejection of its culture. It went to some other source than I. The Declaration of Independence and Emerson to say, this place is immoral and cannot be saved.

  

And so our job is to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted, and that is essentially what I believe the role of social justice is to be in opposition, excuse me, in oppos. To the justice system in opposition to institutions to claim that all American institutions are irretrievably corrupt and that all of the productions of those American institutions are poison fruit.

  

And I don't buy that. I don't buy that. I don't suggest that nothing is reform.  And no improvements can be made. If I believe that then I probably wouldn't be in science or technology or in engineering. Certainly they do, but you have to use the tools of reason. You have to brainstorm, you have to have a sense of humor, and you have to have, have to keep your hubris at.

  

and certainly you can't just be revolutionary and say, we hate everything. We all have to burn it down and start all over. I know it made for a good Tracy Chapman song, but this is reality. So who are the woke? The woke are the people who, in my estimation, are incapable of. Enough democratic representation to get the Congress of the United States of America to revoke the titles of the Civil Rights Movement because the civil rights movement was a clarification and a reform to everyth.

  

that would embrace and include all persons in the United States regardless of their race, color, creed, sexual orientation, gender, sexual preference religion national origin, et cetera, et cetera. All of those attributes of human beings we have. And it takes time in a peaceful legal policy way to reform and ensure those things are clear.

  

Okay. And the woke are those who have become hard multiculturalists to say there should be no integration. There should be separate but equal, and. , every institution up until this point is corrupt to the extent which we can't find value in them. They must be infiltrated and subverted because they're not paying enough attention to race, color, creed, national origin gender, sex sexual preference et cetera, et c.

  

and they're doing so in an illiberal way. Okay. So basically you basically have people who are patriotic reformers, and you have people who are seditious revolutionaries.  Let's just put it bluntly that way. And the woke are the seditious revolutionaries who cannot reform. Who have who've demonstrated themselves incapable except at the margins for the past two, two years of implementing the kind of Marxist historicism and revolutionary hijacking of history such that the average Joe in.

  

Feels like they should vote such a person into Congress, and then we should start all over. So to the extent that awoke is a social movement rather than a coherent political movement, I have some hope. But that's not to necessarily say that politics in America are not populist, that are not subject to wild swings of irrational.

  

And exuberance and PT Barnes game playing. I don't have a lot of faith in that. In fact, I'm thinking about the limits of political power. And then I'm rather glad that we have power in America that is not so consolidated such that a political.  can really take over America.

  

I think we came close with Trump and I think we're still hurt from that. But really the question is what is the fate of a settled, rational person with a sense of humor that's not trying to remake the entire world? What is the fate of any. Of any progress or e even maintaining a decent status quo.

  

It's not like we have to have a genius like Jonas Salt born every generation, but we certainly do have to inoculate all the babies. But then if you can enter post-modern bullshit such that people can be sustainably anti-vaccine. Then you are looking at the crumbling of your civilization.

  

So I come at it from the point of view of someone who is misrepresented as a monolithic ethnic minority with the false premise of race. Someone who isr.  and defends liberty from the tradition of the Enlightenment and the philosophy of science. I'm a big fan of Carl Popper

  

and I want to be on the side of where there are constitutional guarantees of liberty and justice for all institution.  with, regardless of race, color, creed, et cetera, et cetera. And I don't want some populous blowhards saying right now we have to deal with transgender especially and say that special care and special recognition.

  

multiple standards must be upheld in in, in multiple tiers where the government has to be in favor of, special dispensation. Yeah I don't want a multi-tiered society in recognition of unchangeable attributes of human. , that is, that's the destruction of liberty. So I come at this from a civil libertarian perspective, which is saying that the woke people are doing it exactly the wrong way.

  

That they have poisoned the idea of diversity and harden the lines where they talk about different kinds of,  rather than different sorts of people. I can be one sort today. I can be sorted another way tomorrow. But if you accept an essentialism that says I am a kind of human being and that kind of human being has to be recognized in law, in society all the time, then I'm not gonna play that game.

  

So social justice can be.  And again I've done Catholic social justice. I've understood those teachings, but nobody is mandated to be Catholic. And so I am concerned about the political escalation that would ratchet this into law. And I live in California. I know what the California state legislature has tried and they have tried crazy.

  

And if that kind of posturing continues, then we're not gonna be able to trust just about anybody. And the question is, can we even depoliticize the judiciary? And that's really the scary question behind all of this.

  

So what is woke? Woke is social justice. It's an attitude within social justice that says, that takes us an assumption, the fundamental corruption of American institutions by a hard multicultural standard. And so they're saying, integr.  And

  

integration is not worthwhile, and that meritocracy is not worthwhile. That there are kinds of human beings that cannot mix without social assistance, without government assistance, without legal assistance without a changing of their. In public perception and in law, and that goes against the fundamentals of civil liberty as established in enlightenment liberalism.

  

So they are the enemies of liberalism and one can see that their divisiveness is clear. And I would like to offer a Conor example. That, that I'm familiar with, and that would be sports. I grew up in the time where heroes were like Mickey Thompson, like Dan Bricklin, like evil can evil and like ums, skateboarders who expanded the notion of sports, finding new ways.

  

Put sportsmanship in places that had never been before. And the attitude of surfers has never been a threat to society. They've never tried to take over society. They have just said, this is what we do. And we are willing to risk our lives for this sport. And nobody thinks that surfers are divi.

  

and they expanded the possibilities for everyone. And so they're a different sort of people and they have changed and enriched all of our lives by challenging the boundaries of sport and expanding them beyond what anybody thought before. And so I think we have all of extreme sports for that.

  

And hats off to the late Ken.  As the modern example, contemporary example. So you can expand the dimensions of American society without this revolutionary exclusiveness takeover kind of attitude. And that's the problem with the wilkis and good intent is destroyed by their horrible methodology.

  

that's what has to be fixed. And I think it will be I'm not fear, afraid of that. I'm more afraid of what their influence in the mainstream does by people who are not as detailed

  

as they could be. And, the power plays that have been successful on university campus. . It's frightening, but frightening in a way that, you say that, that youth and students are not being served and they're gonna wake up and say, oh my God, everything they taught me was a lie.

  

And that's coming. Anyway. This is my completely extemporaneous background about the framework of under. Why I, and I think many Americans should be against the woke, their hard, non-integrated multiculturalism and their illiberal methods. That's all.
