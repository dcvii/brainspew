## Lexus has a new supercar on the horizon dubbed the LFR. Here’s what we know about it so far.

Toyota is building a new race car. We saw the first GR GT3 concept at the Tokyo Auto Salon in 2022, and all the spy videos and patent images since then preview a vehicle similar to that original concept. But it won't be limited to the track.

Toyota will offer a road-going version of the GR GT3 that will almost certainly wear a [Lexus](https://www.motor1.com/lexus/) badge in the US. It will likely be called the LFR, with the race version expected to debut early in 2026 and the road-going model to follow shortly thereafter.

Lexus has been dropping subtle hints over the past few months, which means the car isn't a complete mystery. And recently, Lexus debuted the new Sport Concept in Monterey—which looks *suspiciously* similar to many of the prototypes we've seen already.

With that in mind, we've rounded up as many of those details as we can; Here's everything you need to know about the upcoming Lexus LFR.

## What Will It Be Called?

The GR GT3 name comes from [Toyota's 2022 concept](https://www.motor1.com/news/559184/toyota-gr-gt3-concept-teaser/), but the official name should change when it launches. The road car should [wear a Lexus badge](https://www.motor1.com/news/673248/toyota-gr-gt3-lexus-road-car/) in the US, and it will likely be called the LFR—acting as somewhat of a successor to the beloved LFA.

The LFR will also fill the gap left by the RC and LC coupes, which are both likely to be discontinued after the 2025 model year.

## What Will the Lexus LFR Look Like?

Our best look yet at the upcoming Lexus LFR happened at this year’s The Quail show in Monterey. Lexus quietly introduced a new prototype called the [Sport Concept](https://www.motor1.com/news/769120/lexus-sport-concept-monterey-car-week/), which had similar front-engine, rear-drive proportions to the earlier concepts we’ve seen testing. The rendering pictured here is based on that concept.

In a press release, Lexus said:

> *'The progressively styled, future-focused yet truly authentic sports car signals the way forward for Lexus design. This inspiring concept car features a wide, low-profile two-door form that blends dynamic and emotional elements into a vision for a next-generation sports car.'*

Prior to the Sport Concept’s debut, [spy videos](https://www.motor1.com/news/763506/lexus-lfr-california-spy-video-colorado-spy-photos/) and [patent images](https://www.motor1.com/news/594710/toyota-gr-gt3-patent-images/) (below) showed a long, sleek coupe similar to the GR GT3 concept. The test vehicles in those videos featured massive lower bumper openings with aggressive splitters, canards, wings, and a huge hood vent with radiators—all the necessary hardware for tearing up the track.

The patent images, uncovered in June 2022, make no direct mention of the GR GT3. But it's hard not to believe that they preview the production model. It looks like what one would expect of a street-legal version of the concept.

The car retains the front splitter and hood vent, which are much less aggressive. The racer's big wing is missing from the car in the patent, but it still has a sizeable rear diffuser, taillights with triangular accents, and vents reminiscent of the LFA.

It's also long, with the cabin pushed back on the body just ahead of the rear wheels; It looks like a Mercedes-AMG GT with a squished roof and body kit in profile (fitting, given that the company is testing the LFR alongside the AMG GT). The massive front fenders, with vents, appear to house side-exit exhaust tips that are well out of the way of burning anyone's calves.

The rendering pictured here imagines what the LFR could look like when it reaches the road.

## What Engine Will the Lexus LFR Have?

![](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/E6WpLz/s5/lexus-rc-f-enthusiast-and-emotional-touring-jdm.webp)

Lexus hasn't provided any hint as to what might power the LFR. However, a [recent spy video](https://www.motor1.com/news/721512/toyota-gr-gt3-spa-francorchamps/) captured the car's exhaust note, and it sure sounded like a V-8—at least on the track. It could use an evolution of the naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V-8 engine that powers the Lexus RC F GT3, which makes over 500 horsepower.

The [Lexus RC F](https://www.motor1.com/lexus/rc-f/) you can drive to work every day also has a naturally aspirated V-8 engine, but it only displaces 5.0 liters while making 472 hp. That's enough power to get the RC F Track Edition to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds, but it's unclear if a V-8 will power the production car. There's certainly enough room ahead of the windshield for one.

While the hard-hitting F-badged version of the car will likely have pure combustion power (and hopefully eight cylinders), the model's more pedestrian trims could adopt smaller engines and even hybrid setups. Lexus offers the 2024 RC with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 241 hp and a naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V-6 with 260 hp.

But, it all depends on where the car will fall in the lineup.

## When Will the Lexus LFR Debut?

Toyota Racing President David Wilson suggested earlier in 2024 that the GR GT3 race car could debut at the 2026 Daytona 24 Hours in January. But the road car won’t show up until later.

The Lexus-badged sports car is one reason we won't see the GR GT3 race until 2026. It was supposed to be ready for the 2025 season, but Toyota reportedly had to delay it by a year due to hurdles in developing the road-going model homologation. We expect Toyota to introduce it in mid-to-late 2025 before going on sale the following year.

How Much Will It Cost?

The outgoing Lexus RC F Final Edition starts at $94,120, while the entry-level RC with the turbocharged four-cylinder costs $46,915 (both prices include the destination fee). Lexus's current lineup also consists of the [LC500](https://www.motor1.com/lexus/lc-500/), which has a $101,200 starting price for 2025.

That said, we expect the LFR to be pricier than both of those models still. Lest you forget, the LFA started at a whopping $375,000 when new, and cost up to $445,000 for the Nurburgring trim. The LFR likely won’t be that expensive, but we’ll have to wait and see.
