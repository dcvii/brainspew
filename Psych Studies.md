To provide a summary of the psychological studies and their conclusions based on the image you uploaded, I will perform an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the text in the image. Hereâ€™s a brief description of the studies and their main findings based on the extracted text:

1. **Disgust & Homophobia (Inbar et al., 2009)**: This study investigates the relationship between feelings of disgust and homophobic attitudes, suggesting a potential link where disgust can amplify negative attitudes toward homosexuality.

2. **Assimilation & Contrast (Schwarz et al., 1991)**: This research explores how individuals' perceptions are influenced by contextual factors, leading to assimilation (conforming to surrounding opinions) or contrast (differentiating from them).

3. **Correspondence Bias (Miyamoto & Kitayama, 2002)**: This study examines how people tend to attribute others' behaviors to their dispositions rather than situational factors, known as the fundamental attribution error.

4. **Intentional Side-Effects (Knobe, 2003)**: This study delves into how people perceive the intentionality of side effects, with findings suggesting that negative side effects are more likely to be perceived as intentional than positive ones.

5. **Trolley Dilemma 1 (Hauser et al., 2007)**: The study explores moral decision-making in the classic trolley problem, highlighting how people weigh the ethical implications of harming one to save many.

6. **False Consensus 1 (Ross et al., 1977)**: This research looks into the false consensus effect, where individuals overestimate the extent to which others share their beliefs and behaviors.

7. **Moral Typecasting (Gray & Wegner, 2009)**: This study suggests that people tend to categorize others as either moral agents (capable of good or bad actions) or moral patients (deserving of moral consideration), but not both.

8. **False Consensus 2 (Ross et al., 1977)**: Similar to the first study, this examines how people incorrectly assume that others share their attitudes and behaviors.

9. **Intuitive Reasoning (Norenzayan et al., 2002)**: This study explores how intuitive thinking influences decision-making and how different cultures may rely on intuition versus analytic reasoning.

10. **Less is Better (Hsee, 1998)**: The research suggests that people sometimes prefer less over more when the smaller option is presented in isolation, highlighting inconsistencies in human preferences.

11. **Framing (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981)**: This famous study demonstrates how the way choices are framed (e.g., as gains or losses) can significantly impact decision-making.

12. **Direction & SES (Huang et al., 2014)**: This study investigates the relationship between social class (SES) and directional preferences, suggesting that higher SES individuals might have different spatial and directional biases.

13. **Moral Foundations (Graham et al., 2009)**: This research examines the moral foundations theory, which posits that different cultures and individuals prioritize different moral values (e.g., harm, fairness).

14. **Tempting Fate (Risen & Gilovich, 2008)**: The study explores the belief in tempting fate, where people feel that taking unnecessary risks increases the likelihood of negative outcomes.

15. **Trolley Dilemma 2 (Hauser et al., 2007)**: Another exploration of the moral dilemmas presented in the trolley problem, focusing on different variations of the ethical scenario.

16. **Priming Consumerism (Bauer et al., 2012)**: This study looks into how consumerism primes can influence people's attitudes and behaviors, possibly leading to increased materialism.

17. **Incidental Anchors (Critcher & Gilovich, 2008)**: The research investigates how unrelated anchors (numbers or information) can influence people's judgments and decisions in an unrelated domain.

18. **Social Value Orientation (Van Lange et al., 1997)**: This study examines individual differences in social value orientation, which describes people's preferences for distributing resources between themselves and others.

19. **Moral Cleansing (Zhong & Liljenquist, 2006)**: The study explores how people engage in moral cleansing behaviors, such as physical cleansing, to alleviate feelings of guilt after unethical actions.

20. **Position & Power (Giessner & Schubert, 2007)**: This research investigates the relationship between physical position (e.g., height) and perceived power, suggesting that higher positions are often associated with greater power.

21. **Direction & Similarity (Tversky & Gati, 1978)**: This study examines how the perceived similarity between objects or concepts can influence directional preferences.

22. **SMS & Well-Being (Anderson et al., 2012)**: The study explores the relationship between social media use (specifically SMS) and individuals' well-being, highlighting potential negative impacts.

23. **Priming Warmth (Zaval et al., 2014)**: This research investigates how priming warmth (e.g., through physical warmth or warm imagery) can influence people's social judgments and behaviors.

24. **Structure & Goal Pursuit (Kay et al., 2014)**: The study explores how structural factors (such as societal norms) influence individuals' goal pursuit and achievement.

25. **Incidental Disfluency (Alter et al., 2007)**: This research examines how disfluency (difficulty in processing information) can lead to more deliberate and careful thinking, potentially improving decision-making.

26. **Choosing or Rejecting (Shafir, 1993)**: The study investigates how the framing of choices as either accepting or rejecting can influence decision-making, with people often finding rejection easier than acceptance.

27. **Affect & Risk (Rottenstreich & Hsee, 2001)**: This study examines the role of affect (emotions) in risk perception, suggesting that emotional responses can heavily influence risk-related decisions.

28. **Actions are Choices (Savani et al., 2010)**: This research explores how the perception of actions as choices influences people's satisfaction and sense of control, with implications for well-being.

Each of these studies represents a significant contribution to the field of psychology, offering insights into human behavior, cognition, and decision-making processes. The image contrasts the effect sizes of these studies across WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) and less WEIRD populations.
