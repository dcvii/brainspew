Investors haven’t just been selling tech stocks in recent weeks. They’ve also been selling the bonds of big tech companies.

The extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to hold Oracle bonds due in 2055 was recently hovering around 1.77 percentage point, according to MarketAxess. That was up from 1.2 percentage point right after the bonds were issued in September.

The spread for Meta Platforms bonds due in 2054 was recently around 1.01 percentage point, up from 0.78 percentage point less than a month ago.

Tech companies like Oracle and Meta in the bond market to fund investments in artificial-intelligence infrastructure. The increased supply of new bonds has helped drive up spreads, with investors demanding higher returns to hold a larger quantity of debt.

The debt-funded spending is also hurting the credit metrics of the companies, raising the risk of ratings downgrades and providing another reason for spreads to increase. Not all companies have been equally affected, with the spreads of triple-A rated Microsoft bonds only moving marginally higher.
