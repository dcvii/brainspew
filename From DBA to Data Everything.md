Lessons From a Career in Data

---

---

In this episode of the Data Engineering Central Podcast, I interview a Data OG, someone who’s been around the data space forever, and we talked about all things data, past, present, and future.

> *I’m joined by [Thomas Horton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-horton-475a4453/) a longtime friend and one of the most well-rounded data professionals I know. Over the course of his career, Tom has worn just about every hat in data: developer, DBA, analyst, and everything in between. He’s lived through the era of on-prem databases, the rise of analytics, and the constant reinvention that defines modern data engineering today.*

We talk about what’s changed, what hasn’t, and why many of the “new” problems in data feel oddly familiar. We also dig into lessons learned the hard way, lessons that are just as relevant for early-career data engineers as they are for seasoned practitioners navigating today’s ever-expanding stacks.

On a personal note, a huge portion of what I know about relational databases and analytics can be traced back to Tom. This conversation is part reflection, part history lesson, and part reality check on where the data industry is headed next.
