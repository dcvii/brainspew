***Welcome to “Things Worth Remembering,” in which writers recall nuggets of wisdom from history that we should commit to heart. This week, after Donald Trump spoke of securing a peace deal in Ukraine, [Peter Savodnik](https://www.thefp.com/w/peter-savodnik) remembers a [great speech](https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/3267) given by George H.W. Bush in that same country in 1991. Back then, it was seen as controversial, but the “Chicken Kiev” speech, as it came to be known, is now a blueprint for how America can support democracy abroad without becoming the world’s policeman.***

In honor of Presidents’ Day Weekend, I’d like to recall the last full-fledged adult to occupy the Oval Office: George H.W. Bush.

All five presidents who followed him—six, if we count Donald Trump twice—don’t really seem like presidents as much as *simulacra* of presidents. They all knew—or know—how a president is supposed to sound and act and gesticulate, and tried their best to do that.

But Bush Sr. was not a simulation of anything.

He had an ease, a conviction, a noblesse oblige coupled with an aloofness that only a member of the (now mostly extinct) White Anglo-Saxon Protestant species could pull off. His aura was made all the more mystical, paradoxically, by his awkwardness, which seemed to hide something. He was a former CIA director and longtime pol who had jostled his way to the acme of the global structure. He seemed to traffic in subtext and the art of omission. In what was not said.

Which brings us to the so-called Chicken Kiev Speech.

It was August 1, 1991—a few weeks before Ukraine, one of the remaining republics of the rapidly crumbling Soviet Union, would declare independence—and the American president was in the Ukrainian capital to celebrate democratic reform and national sovereignty.

This is worth recalling today, given [President Trump’s announcement](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1889722028120285217) that he spoke last week with Russian president Vladimir Putin to jump-start a negotiation to end the Ukraine war.

Not a man of subtexts or subtlety, our president has exhibited many of the misunderstandings that characterize current right-wing thinking about the former Soviet Union. The glossing over of the Russian past. The belief that even though the U.S. had the power, in the 1990s, to choreograph massive, historical developments—the breakup of an empire, the expansion of the NATO alliance—it somehow lacks the power, in 2025, to repel a weakened Russia that the entire civilized world is against.

In the summer of 1991, I was camped out on Chappaquiddick, in Martha’s Vineyard, the fertile crescent of the old Democratic Party, staying in a house near the water, where there was no television. The morning after the speech, I pedaled over to the general store and picked up *The New York Times* and *The Wall Street Journal*, and spent the better part of the day poring over a transcript of what Bush said, and absorbing the commentary.

I read about how he took the podium at the Ukrainian parliament, which was, for the time being, Moscow’s controlling authority in Kyiv, [and said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkjxf76xRTw), “Every American in that long motorcade, and believe me, it was long, was moved and touched by the warmth of the welcome of Ukraine—we’ll never forget it.”

Then, Bush said something that would have been unimaginable for an American president to say a year or two before, when the demise of the Soviet Union was not yet evident.

“Centuries ago, your forebears named this country Ukraine, or *frontier*, because your steppes link Europe and Asia. But Ukrainians have become frontiersmen of another sort. Today, you explore the frontiers and contours of liberty.”

By the time the president had arrived in Kyiv, it was obvious that the Soviet empire was coming undone. This had been happening ever since Mikhail Gorbachev took power in March 1985. Gorbachev wanted to reform the beast, but the beast could not be reformed. It could only be toppled. Now the spiraling was ratcheting up: The Baltic states had declared independence, the [Warsaw Pact](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/warsaw-treaty) was dead, a war had just started in the former Yugoslavia.

In Washington, they worried about what would happen if the whole post-communist world was gripped by ethnic nationalism. It would be horrific. And there were nukes—35,000 [of them](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/what-happened-soviet-superpowers-nuclear-arsenal-clues-nuclear-security-summit) scattered across 11 time zones.

There were fears then, as there are now, about America overextending itself. Paul Kennedy’s *The Rise [and Fall of the Great Powers](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780679720195)*, which warned that the United States could cease to be a superpower, had come out just two years earlier. It was being talked about and debated in the media, and read on campuses nationwide. But many Americans, including the president, also appreciated what might happen if the U.S. abandoned its role as a global leader.

The real question for Bush was *how* to lead. How to peacefully expedite the unwinding of the Soviet Union.

In his elegant speech, he managed to communicate support for the democratic cause without encouraging Ukrainians to revolt against the regime. “For years, people in this nation felt powerless, overshadowed by a vast government apparatus, cramped by forces that attempted to control every aspect of their lives. Today, your people probe the premise of freedom. In cities and republics, on farms, in businesses, around university campuses, you debate the fundamental questions of liberty, self-rule and free enterprise,” he said. “Americans, you see, have a deep commitment to these values. We follow your progress with a sense of fascination, excitement, and hope.”

Throughout the nearly 22-minute address, he celebrated the rights of Ukrainians without celebrating a future Soviet crack-up.

“We cannot tell you how to reform your society,” Bush said. “We will not try to pick winners and losers in political competitions between republics or between republics and the center. That is *your* business.”

After that, he said: “Do not doubt our real commitment, however, to reform.”

But also: “Do not think we can presume to think we can solve your problems for you.”

In the Ukrainian parliament, they greeted the speech with sustained applause and a standing ovation. They understood what Bush understood, which was that there was nothing to be gained from embarrassing or antagonizing Gorbachev. Gorbachev was the way forward. What would happen if something happened to him? What would happen if he were replaced by a brutal tyrant, someone like Slobodan Milosevic, the new president of Serbia?

Meanwhile, the American right, which was different from the one we have now, thought the speech wasn’t tough enough, that Bush lacked the manly strut of his predecessor, Ronald Reagan. They wanted a “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall” [kind of speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX00QkvK-mQ). They wanted Russia put in its place. In fact, it was *New York Times* columnist William Safire [who dubbed](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/29/opinion/essay-after-the-fall.html) Bush’s address the “Chicken Kiev speech,” lamenting it as cowardly and in keeping with Bush’s “giveback of Iraq” after the Gulf War. (Safire noted [in 2004](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/06/opinion/putins-chicken-kiev.html) that Bush had been so “infuriated” by his characterization that he hadn’t spoken to Safire since.)

Safire was wrong about the speech because he was stuck in the partisan muck. The partisan wants pyrotechnics and drama. He forgets that the drama is not the point. Ending tyranny, or upholding the principle of national sovereignty, is the point.

The art of being the American president in 1991 was knowing what not to do, what not to say. We need more of this. The dangers we face now are not as clear now as they were then, but they are proliferating, and coming at us from Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang, Tehran, and elsewhere.

Bush’s speech is a reminder of how a great leader acts under enormous pressure, of how he walks a very fine line.

He had always been a Cold Warrior, and toward the end of his speech, he seemed touched and even a little overwhelmed to be there. “The peoples of the U.S.S.R. have entered a great enterprise, full of courage and vigor,” he said.

“I have come here today to say we support those who explore the frontiers of freedom. We will join these reformers on the path to what we call, appropriately call, a new world order.”

And then: “You’re the leaders.”
