My suggestion would be  
  
1. Figure out how long you gonna speak (1 min, 5 mins, etc)  
  
2. Define if it is a speech on a subject, or opening / welcoming remarks, or some other type of speech  
  
3. Use Bing, ChatGPT or Bard AI to enter your parameters (i.e. tell one of these tools to “act like you are the world’s best speech writer and write a (2) minute speech to be given at the World Bank office. The purpose of the speech is to (FOR EXAMPLE: share the importance of providing funding for art exhibitions around the continent showcasing African Artists living on the Continent of Africa). The speech should include expounded information around the following points (FOR EXAMPLE: the difference in African art, why financing is crucial to helping these artists tell their story, and how attendees benefit).  
  
4. Take what’s generated and do additional queries to hone in on particular points or details not presented in the results from the initial query.  
  
5. Massage all of that to what makes sense and seems right for you  
  
6. Read your final version out loud 20 times at least 10 days before your speech and then sit it aside for 2-3 days.  
  
7. Read it again after 3 days and make whatever additional adjustments you feel it needs  
  
8. Read it 20 more times and then record it  
  
9. Listen to it over and over and over for the next two days while driving, working out, using the toilet, etc., until it becomes second nature, like your favorite song that you sing now with out looking at the words.  
  
10. Two days out, make you a little card of very short 2-3 words bullet points that you refer to only if you get off track for some reason while speaking  
  
11. Finally, OWN it, speak as if what you are speaking about is second nature to you! (And it will be because you are so familiar with the content of the speech at this point.)
