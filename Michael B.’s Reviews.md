	Everything you want in a Poke place. They're getting harder to find. Plenty of parking, plenty of food. Absolutely fresh, and friendly service.

	This is a great place for some of the best takeout Mexican food you're going to get in LA. Their shrimp quesadilla is just perfect. So is their ceviche. If you're not sitting down in a fancy restaurant and paying top dollar, you're not going to get any better. When you go to a place like Miches, you just know that trucks are overrated. This is the perfect blend of fast, good and inexpensive. Only one downside. No Grubhub.

	I went all the way to New Orleans from Los Angeles to get myself a stingy brim. I was originally going to go to that shop downtown, which is rather legendary, but it turned out that this shop had exactly what I was looking for.

	Ahh they used to be great. And then in about 6 months, they went totally down the toilet. They got rid of their best people. They got stingy with the portions. They tried to sell ramen. And now they got shut down by the Health Department. What a waste. I wonder if the one in Torrance is still any good.

	So I'm watching that legendary dude who runs The In Groove out of Phoenix list out his top 100 vinyl albums in print on YouTube. Once again I'm entranced by the entire vinyl magic. Even though I'm primarily digital first, I have a reasonable little collection of vinyl. So I've got the bug to get some more records and what's this I find? Boogie Maru. Actually right in the next block from my favorite ramen house. (Josui). This I got to see.  
	  
	It's a super cool hole in the wall. Racks of retro components including Krell and Sansui are spinning vinyl. They've got some tube amps behind the counter too. I immediately recognize there's a man my age behind the racks working on something and I already love it. This is legit old school. There's about a half dozen or so bins of Jazz so I go straight to it and let my fingers do the walking.  
	  
	I found two prize LPs, one of Coltrane's Ballads (which was in the top 100) and a live recording of Yellow Magic Orchestra (Public Pressure). I got six more plus a T-shirt. When I'm checking out, I realize I hadn't even looked up to see some more extraordinary collectable albums behind the counter.  
	  
	I'm really happy to have found this place. Great selection. Excellent JP imports. I had to stop myself. Next time I'm coming back for some Cibo Matto and Naganuma. Fingers crossed.

	I have found some of my favorite vinyl here. Specifically a Glenn Gould selection of Bach.  
	  
	As a collector with a digital first inventory, I come out to record stores for very specific reasons. First is to find copies of albums you simply cannot find on streaming services (especially imports). Secondly to find high quality pressings of all-time great albums, or even mediocre ones if they're rare enough. Thirdly to shop.  
	  
	Like libraries, art galleries and antique stores, record stores are sacred places. I can tell that there are young people around who don't understand the hierarchy of things. A record store employee is like the king of the pickup court. You don't walk up to them and start spewing out a bunch of newbie questions and get pissy. They're not baristas. They are historians and curators and collectors of the highest order. But also, unlike librarians and college professors, every item in their music library is owned by them. You are walking through their record collection. They're not just sitting at the front desk to answer your stupid questions, you have to come up with a very good one that shows you've got game. That's where the respect comes in.  
	  
	So to shop in a record store, you have to take your time and walk your fingers through the bins and let every album cover take you on a journey of memory with sparks of curiosity. It sucks when you don't have memory or curiosity. I know. I was young once and only knew a couple dozen bands and what was hot on the radio. The more you know music, the more you can discern the flavor of the collector whose inventory you are browsing. That's the personal touch and the difference between record stores and the Costco approach of Amazon. Those with wisdom recognize the beauty of shopping many different record stores in appreciation of their diversity of selection. Shopping is learning. It's reading. If you are not in the right mindset, you will be disappointed. Get thee haste to YouTube Music.  
	  
	I'm very happy to see that Dudley's has survived the Pandemic and I will be back to round out some of my collection. There have always been enough bargains as well as high quality vinyl to satisfy me. Respect.

	Staying consistent with my reason for giving a five star review, a restaurant has to show me something I haven't seen before, which is excellence from a new perspective. I'm pretty sure I haven't given five since my discovery of Little Sister almost six years ago.  
	  
	So I'm at the Long Beach Grand Prix and I've been drinking hard seltzer all day with my cousin and my nephew. We're having a good old time watching cars burn rubber and trucks fly. Typically, I had a monster bacon wrapped hotdog with peppers and onions. Once the carnival is over, two of us headed over to Ellies about an 8 block walk away.  
	  
	Our reservations were ready and we were immediately seated in this small Italian restaurant. By the time I get my reading glasses on and take off my jacket, I'm starting to notice something about the coziness here. It's as if there's something magic about the sound. You can hear a little bit of music, but it disappears as soon as we start talking. The place is not quiet but there's no strain in conversing between us. I can hear people at other tables in the small joint, but nothing disturbing. I'm already liking this clean, well-lit place.  
	  
	Next, comes the menu. Two cards. One for food, the other for drink. Simple yet ample. Plenty of choices, and we get medium sized plates so this is going to be a sharing experience. Perfect. The cloth napkins have a stripe of color, and the tables are white with a sprinkle of color. It feels like a cafe, but something in it reminds me of Brooklyn. It's bright and intimate. Then it hits me. Our waiter is upon us, without long introductions or pretense he says what he's going to do and then he does it. Sharply. He's all in black with a polo shirt. Over to my right is a short bar where several folks are all busy also in the same black uniform, but all unique. The staff is young and energetic, all handsome but most of all, purposeful. They move with practiced ease, sometimes balancing several plates with up to 10 or 12 stacked glasses. It is like a ballet.  
	  
	I'm a foodie primarily because my wife did her undergrad in Hotel & Restaurant Management. We are practically pros when we go out to eat. Plus I've travelled around the country on business with a nice expense account. I know a good restaurant when I'm in one. This one is especially great for being in LA County. No pretense, swift, attentive, expert service.  
	  
	We went all out. We got the Steak Tartare, which is amazingly different. Two words: caviar aioli. Wow. The Ceasar with crisp and tasty and the Brussels Sprouts were completely unique from the new trend of crispy ones served all around LA. The secret? Pork belly and Bleu cheese. By the time we got to the Meatballs, we were starting to need a break.  
	  
	Sure enough our main courses were late. Next thing we know, Evelyn comes by and apologizes for the delay and offers up more goodies. I resist but then she offers another glass of Sauvignon Blanc, which was super tasty. I take another glass. This is first rate service, bar none. Not fussy, not trying to be impressive, just workmanlike. The people of this restaurant understand this is a craft. They move with expert grace and it shows. And I'm comparing this to some of the best LA has to offer, like 71 Above. And yet it echos of old Italian restaurants I remember from Brooklyn in Park Slope. It's a neighborhood place where you could get to know and ask things of the chef. I could tell the girl in the next table got to decide what went into her spinach salad. Nicely done. Here's the thing. I had the nerve to ask if Evelyn would charge my iPhone as the favor. Bam. She does it without a thought. I went from 3% to 35%. That, my friends, is real service.  
	  
	We get our mains, I got the Lasagna and Phil got the Pappardelle. First bite I realize that in consideration of the Steak Tartare and the Meatballs, that our chef knows how to make Italian sausage. I'm convinced he made ours from scratch. The flavor is just that clearly fresh.  
	  
	I've got to go back. Of course.

	One look at this mom and pop shop and you know you are dealing with the real deal. How did I know? Because he was asking pointed technical questions even before I got my dad's generator in the door. He knew how to fix it before even looking and was giving me good advice between the truck and the shop as I wheeled it over.  
	  
	Just looking inside reminded me of when I had a 3hp Cat minibike, back when go-kart racing was the coolest thing ever at Lonnies on Crenshaw. The State of California makes it hard on small businesses like this who deal with gasoline engines. Now it costs $700 for a permit to dispose of oil. It used to cost $25. Remember when we were told not to water our lawns? This is the kind of honest business that gets squeezed out of existence. It ain't right.  
	  
	I just want to find more ways to support this particular guy. You should too.

	This is, bar none, one of the greatest hole in the wall restaurants I have ever been to. When you have a monstrous appetite, like on the day you're standing in line for BBQ at a picnic and you want to grab a plate before everybody else - this is where you go.  
	  
	Get the Wednesday Worker plate. You have to go on a Wednesday. Get the Tri-tip. Get the Elote. Get the Gouda Mac. You will be stuffed and happy.

	It's weird that people are so touchy about bikes. And I get it. There's a weird middle ground where you don't want a Walmart bike but you don't really know much more than that. So you find yourself talking to somebody who has been working bikes for years and years and it's not an easy conversation. So everybody who gives this guy 1 star, you can blame me.  
	  
	I'm the jerk who used to ride 70 miles a week (which is a little below average for a serious cyclist), and knows more than a little bit. So when I go to a store I'm ready to plunk down $750 without thinking much about it, and without a long drawn out investigative interview. Bike guys love a jerk like me, because if I'm not happy, I'll blame myself.  
	  
	Anyway. Brian served up just what I liked. It took me about 7 minutes of thinking over the course of two trips, and boom I had the bike I like. Also, I'm just stupid loyal to the shop since back to 1990.
