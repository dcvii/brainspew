### A simplified RDF-XML Structure For Today

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lky8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35bcfa40-f770-4264-95e7-1716ce4be9d9_2688x1536.jpeg)

I frequently use SPARQL CONSTRUCT statements (and increasingly SHACL 1.2 node expressions and rules) to generate RDF graphs for output - sometimes to Turtle, sometimes to JSON-LD, and surprisingly often to RDF/XML. However, I think it fair to say that there are very few people who actually *like* the RDF/XML format. There are several problems with it:

- **Long URIs everywhere.** People who are finally getting comfortable with the JSON-LD context format find the use of long URIs in attributes and the difficulty of accessing namespaces in XQuery and XSLT to be a real pain. It’s also hard to read.
- **Normalisation.** RDF is normalised - you have blocks with references that point to other blocks in Turtle, but you end up having to write a lot of id/idref code to convert these structures into trees, which are far more natural in XML. This plays a big role in the complexity of both XPath and XSLT**.**
- **Lists, Collections and Obsolete Structures.** RDF-XML was one of the earliest serialisations of RDF, at a time when the RDF specification itself was still relatively new, and as such, there were a number of constructs such as rdf:partType, collections, and linked lists that heavily influenced the XML structure. Many of these are now fairly obsolete.
- `rdf:Description`**,** `rdf:about`**,** `rdf:resource`**, etc.** The enveloping mechanism for RDF/XML was just awkward. You could simplify it a bit, but the reality was that much of the language's human readability was lost.

This has been bothering me for a while, because to be perfectly honest, I did want to use XSLT more closely with RDF but it was such a pain to write it that it wasn’t worth the effort.

Finally, I bit the bullet and put in some time (and some coding work with Claude) to create **RDF-XSimple**. The code and specification are available at [https://github.com/kurtcagle/rdf-xsimple](https://github.com/kurtcagle/rdf-xsimple).

## Design Goals

When I was designing RDF-XSimple (RDF-XS), I turned those pain points into code requirements. Specifically:

- **Curies.** Just as the context section has made JSON-LD much more useful, there needs to be a way to reduce the need for long IRIs within XML files that identify local resources, replacing them with curies when prefixes are defined.
- **Tree Structures.** When there is only one reference within a dataset to a given entity, it should be possible to make this a subordinate child of that entity, making the output (mostly) hierarchical, simplifying XPath expressions.
- **Simpler Lists.** XML handles lists easier than RDF, so turning the rdf:Collection, rdf:Bag and rdf:Seq into attributes can simplify structures.
- **Support for Reifications.** Reifications are becoming more important in working with RDF, and capturing them consistently should be a high priority for an XML format.
- **Round Tripping.** Any serialisation format should be capable of round-tripping back to RDF with no lossiness or spurious additions.

## RDF-XSimple Format

The RDF-XSimple format is standard XML, but designed for RDF production. The following provides a number of examples illustrating the difference between RDF-XML and RDF-XSimple:

## Example: Namespace Declarations

### Traditional RDF/XML

```markup
<rdf:RDF 
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
  xmlns:schema="http://schema.org/"
  xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">
```

### RDF-XSimple

```markup
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
  <rdf:context>
    <rdf:prefix name="schema" uri="http://schema.org/"/>
    <rdf:prefix name="foaf" uri="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"/>
    <rdf:prefix name="ex" uri="http://example.org/"/>
  </rdf:context>
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ All prefixes in one place
- ✅ Easy to add/modify
- ✅ Can be externalized/reused
- ✅ Consistent with JSON-LD `@context`

## Example: Resource Identifiers

### Traditional RDF/XML

```markup
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/people/alice-smith">
  <schema:worksFor rdf:resource="http://example.org/organizations/tech-corp"/>
</rdf:Description>
```

### RDF-XSimple

```markup
<schema:Person rdf:about="ex:people/alice-smith">
  <schema:worksFor rdf:resource="ex:organizations/tech-corp"/>
</schema:Person>
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ 70% shorter URIs
- ✅ Easier to read and type
- ✅ Namespace changes only affect context
- ✅ Matches Turtle/SPARQL syntax

## Example: Datatypes

### Traditional RDF/XML

```markup
<schema:age rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">32</schema:age>
<schema:height rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal">1.68</schema:height>
<schema:birthDate rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date">1992-03-15</schema:birthDate>
```

### RDF-XSimple

```markup
<schema:age type="integer">32</schema:age>
<schema:height type="decimal">1.68</schema:height>
<schema:birthDate type="date">1992-03-15</schema:birthDate>
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ 75% shorter datatype declarations
- ✅ More readable
- ✅ Matches common programming languages
- ✅ Still supports custom datatypes

## Example: Structure (Denormalization)

### Traditional RDF/XML (Normalized)

```markup
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/people/alice-smith">
  <schema:address rdf:resource="http://example.org/addresses/addr-1001"/>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/addresses/addr-1001">
  <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://schema.org/PostalAddress"/>
  <schema:streetAddress>742 Evergreen Terrace</schema:streetAddress>
  <schema:addressCountry rdf:resource="http://example.org/countries/usa"/>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/countries/usa">
  <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://schema.org/Country"/>
  <schema:name xml:lang="en">United States</schema:name>
</rdf:Description>
```

### RDF-XSimple (Smart Denormalized)

```markup
<schema:Person rdf:about="ex:people/alice-smith">
  <schema:address>
    <schema:PostalAddress rdf:about="ex:addresses/addr-1001">
      <schema:streetAddress>742 Evergreen Terrace</schema:streetAddress>
      <schema:addressCountry>
        <schema:Country rdf:about="ex:countries/usa">
          <schema:name lang="en">United States</schema:name>
        </schema:Country>
      </schema:addressCountry>
    </schema:PostalAddress>
  </schema:address>
</schema:Person>
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Hierarchical structure matches data relationships
- ✅ Single-reference resources automatically inlined
- ✅ Preserves resource identity with `rdf:about`
- ✅ Easier to understand data model
- ✅ Still produces identical RDF triples

## Example: Lists

### Traditional RDF/XML

```markup
<rdf:Description>
  <schema:skillRanking rdf:parseType="Collection">
    <rdf:Description>
      <schema:name>Python</schema:name>
      <schema:proficiencyLevel rdf:datatype="...#integer">5</schema:proficiencyLevel>
    </rdf:Description>
    <rdf:Description>
      <schema:name>JavaScript</schema:name>
      <schema:proficiencyLevel rdf:datatype="...#integer">4</schema:proficiencyLevel>
    </rdf:Description>
  </schema:skillRanking>
</rdf:Description>
```

### RDF-XSimple

```markup
<schema:skillRanking rdf:list="true">
  <schema:Skill>
    <schema:name>Python</schema:name>
    <schema:proficiencyLevel type="integer">5</schema:proficiencyLevel>
  </schema:Skill>
  <schema:Skill>
    <schema:name>JavaScript</schema:name>
    <schema:proficiencyLevel type="integer">4</schema:proficiencyLevel>
  </schema:Skill>
</schema:skillRanking>
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Clear `rdf:list="true"` attribute
- ✅ Also supports `rdf:bag="true"` and `rdf:seq="true"`
- ✅ More XML-idiomatic
- ✅ Distinguishes ordered vs. unordered collections

## Example: RDF-star (NEW!)

### Traditional RDF/XML

```markup
<!-- NOT SUPPORTED -->
```

### RDF-XSimple

```markup
<ex:EmploymentClaim rdf:about="ex:claims/claim-001">
  <rdf:quotes>
    <rdf:QuotedTriple>
      <rdf:subject rdf:resource="ex:people/alice-smith"/>
      <rdf:predicate rdf:resource="schema:worksFor"/>
      <rdf:object rdf:resource="ex:organizations/tech-corp"/>
    </rdf:QuotedTriple>
  </rdf:quotes>
  <ex:verifiedBy rdf:resource="ex:hr-database"/>
  <ex:verifiedDate type="dateTime">2024-01-15T10:30:00Z</ex:verifiedDate>
  <ex:confidence type="decimal">1.0</ex:confidence>
</ex:EmploymentClaim>
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Make statements about statements
- ✅ Track provenance and confidence
- ✅ Support temporal validity
- ✅ Critical for knowledge graphs

Note that while the RDF-XSimple spec supports RDF-Star reification, RDF/XML doesn’t yet. RDF-XSimple should (soon) support Turtle 1.2, which does have reification capabilities.

## Using RDF-XSimple

RDF-XSimple is intended principally as a target format for RDF-XML (and vice versa) - once you generate the RDF-XML from a SPARQL call, then you can transform it into RDF-XSimple in a number of different ways:

```markup
# Using Saxon
saxon -s:input.rdf -xsl:xslt/rdfxml1-to-rdfxml2.xsl -o:output.rdf

# Using xsltproc
xsltproc xslt/rdfxml1-to-rdfxml2.xsl input.rdf > output.rdf
```

where the transformations are contained in the GitHub project listed above.

Transform RDF-XSimple back to standard RDF/XML:

```markup
saxon -s:input.rdf -xsl:xslt/rdfxml2-to-rdfxml1.xsl -o:output.rdf
```

### Schema Validation

Validate documents against the XSD schema:

```markup
# Validate single file
xmllint --schema schema/rdfxml2.xsd examples/simple-person.rdf

# Validate all examples
./validate-examples.sh
```

Using Python:

```markup
from lxml import etree

schema = etree.XMLSchema(file=’schema/rdfxml2.xsd’)
doc = etree.parse(’examples/simple-person.rdf’)

if schema.validate(doc):
    print(”Valid!”)
else:
    print(schema.error_log)
```

### Node.js

```markup
const { transform } = require(’saxon-js’);
const fs = require(’fs’);

transform({
  stylesheetFileName: ‘xslt/rdfxml1-to-rdfxml2.xsl’,
  sourceFileName: ‘input.rdf’,
  destination: ‘serialized’
}).then(output => {
  fs.writeFileSync(’output.rdf’, output.principalResult);
});
```

### Python

```markup
from lxml import etree

# Load XSLT
xslt = etree.parse(’xslt/rdfxml1-to-rdfxml2.xsl’)
transform = etree.XSLT(xslt)

# Load RDF/XML
doc = etree.parse(’input.rdf’)

# Transform
result = transform(doc)
print(str(result))
```

The resulting XML can then be used more effectively within an XSLT toolchain, with XQuery, or with XProc.

## Caveats

I’m working on direct Turtle2RDF-XSimple and JSONLD2RDF-XSimple projects related to this.

RDF-XSimple is a work in progress and should definitely be considered alpha software at this point. Please contact me at kurt.cagle@gmail.com with bug reports, questions or comments.
