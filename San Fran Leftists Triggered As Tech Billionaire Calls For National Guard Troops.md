**A long-left-leaning billionaire philanthropist has triggered San Francisco politicians** by praising President Trump's performance in office -- and even more so by **urging Trump to deploy National Guard soldiers** to suppress the city's rampant criminality.

**"I fully support the president,"** **said Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff** in an interview with the *New York Times. "* I think he’s doing a great job." That puts Benioff at stark odds with his fellow San Franciscans: In a June Public Policy Institute of California poll, [77% of Bay Area residents disapproved](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html) of Trump's performance. Benioff recounted his recent honor of sitting across a table from Trump at a state dinner hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle, and said he used the dinner to tell Trump “how grateful I am for everything he’s doing.”

The [*Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html)  notes that Benioff, a major benefactor of San Francisco, has leaned toward the left side of the spectrum -- for example, urging other business leaders to help the homeless rather than gripe about their existence. Now, however, as homeless, drugged-out criminals are destroying San Francisco, **he's ready for soldiers and Humvees to pour into the city he says is woefully under-policed** \-- figuring it needs another 1,000 cops on top of the 1,500 that are currently on the force.

The situation has compelled Benioff to take matters into his own hands, where his upcoming Dreamforce conference is concerned: **He's hiring hundreds of off-duty cops to secure the area around the San Francisco convention area.** “You’ll see. When you walk through San Francisco next week, there will be cops on every corner,” Benioff said. “That’s how it used to be.” Until the city's police force is beefed up, **Benioff endorses the use of National Guard soldiers.** “We don’t have enough cops, so [if they can be cops, I’m all for it](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html),” he said.

That's a particularly interesting stance, given **Benioff is close friends with California Gov. Gavin Newsom** -- so close, in fact, that [Benioff is a godfather to one of the Newsom's children](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/11/slap-in-the-face-marc-benioffs-trump-turn-stuns-san-francisco-00604421). As Benioff endorses Trump deployment of National Guard troops to San Francisco, Newsom is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of Guard soldiers to Los Angeles. Benioff's left-leaning resume also includes **his hosting of a major 2016 fundraiser for Hillary Clinton** at his $31 million mansion alongside the Presidio, and his personal bankrolling of a city ballot measure to raise taxes on businesses to fund welfare for the homeless.

**"This is a slap in the face to San Francisco,"** Matt Dorsey, a member of the city's Board of Supervisors, wrote on X. "It’s insulting to our cops, and it’s honestly galling to those of us who’ve been fighting hard over the last few years to fully staff our \[police department\]...[We don't NEED the National Guard here](https://x.com/mattdorsey/status/1976842793265119244)." State Sen. Scott Wiener, who's best known for pushing the LGBTQ agenda, chimed in, saying " [We neither need nor want an illegal military occupation](https://x.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1976807377929486639) in San Francisco.” **Assemblyman Matt Haney decried Benioff's "support \[of\] a direct assault and occupation of our city,"** while the *Times* described San Francisco DA Brooke Jenkins as "livid" over Benioff's stance on troops.

It's safe to say **a Benioff aide anticipated the backlash**: The *Times* story about the phone interview with him aboard his private plane concludes in amusing fashion:

> *At the end of the interview, he turned to a public relations executive. He could be heard asking why her mouth was wide open and if he had said anything he shouldn’t have. “What about the political questions?” he asked. “Too spicy?” Then he hung up.*

In August, [Trump teased the possibility of sending troops to San Francisco](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/us/politics/san-francisco-trump-cities.html?searchResultPosition=2), telling reporters in the Oval Office, **“You look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco — they’ve destroyed it..**.we’ll clean that one up, too.”

**Show Me The Bubble**

While investors debate whether the AI boom is a replay of 2000, fundamentals keep saying otherwise. Earnings, margins, and free-cash-flow yields all suggest that this market is priced for strength, not fantasy — making the bubble narrative itself feel overheated. Let's have a look.

Can’t keep a good man down — gold continues surging, trading at the most overbought levels since July 2020 (RSI at 87!) and overshooting the upper trend line. With ETF inflows sticky, price decoupled 25% above its 200-day, and GVZ still calm, upside risks remain firmly in play.

**Japan just elected their own Trump.**

Japan’s 30-year yield is breaking out with one of the biggest up candles in years, eyeing a decisive move above 3.3%. With “Japan’s Trump” Takaichi taking the helm and sticky inflation persisting, Japan’s bearish shocks could ripple across global long-end rates.

The froth is visible. MoMo baskets ripping, CTA length high, and hedge-fund nets near recent peaks. Yet several anchors keep the tape grounded: DB’s “overweight but not yet stretched” GS sentiment subdued, and BofA's sell-side indicator stubbornly unchanged. We have a hard time compartmentalizing the backdrop but the best we can come up with is that the stretch has slack.
