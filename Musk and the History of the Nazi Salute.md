Elon Musk allegedly giving the Nazi salute is a perfect example of the boy who cried wolf. Or rather, the leftist who cried Nazi. We heard it for years. All white people are racist. America is a white supremacy. Trump is a literal Nazi. Now Musk is a Nazi.

Hours after Trump was inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States, the tech billionaire hailed the outcome as “no ordinary victory.” Speaking to the crowd at the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, he added, “This was a fork in the road of human civilization. This one really mattered. Thank you for making it happen!”

Musk then slapped his right hand on his chest, right over his heart, and extended his arm up and out with his palm down and fingers together. This _does_ unmistakably resemble the Roman salute. But that doesn’t make Musk a Nazi.

The Roman salute originated with Jacques-Louis David’s 1784 painting _The Oath of Horatii_, in which the three Horatii brothers pledge their lives to Rome and volunteer to fight three brothers from the opposing army, thus sparing a costly battle between their two peoples. Later, this symbol of masculine self-sacrifice was adopted by Italian fascists, and then famously the Nazis.

Because the Nazis adopted the Roman salute, Americans decided to change their own flag salute, which was identical. When I was a kid, the Pledge of Allegiance was accompanied by the hand-over-heart salute. But this wasn’t always the case. The original salute for the Pledge of Allegiance was known as the Bellamy salute, named after the author of the Pledge itself, the socialist and Baptist minister Francis Bellamy. Yes, the Pledge of Allegiance was written by a socialist.

The gesture was officially changed when Congress amended the _Flag Code_ in 1942, in order to distance ourselves from what had become known as the “Nazi salute.”

But what has happened since 1942—or rather, since 2022—is exactly what I have longed warned would happen. The word no longer turns heads. The accusation doesn’t cut. Being called racist, sexist, or even fascist no longer has power, thanks to overuse and abuse of these terms by the left.

Ironically, the very people who claimed to oppose fascism have helped pave the way for it by desensitizing the public to these labels. Yes, as I [recently wrote](https://www.theradicalist.com/p/elon-musk-and-the-afd), Musk supports AfD. But awkwardly throwing his heart to the crowd is not reason enough for such claims. Yet respectable people on X can’t help themselves.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University, [wrote](https://x.com/davidvolodzko/status/1881509824703447318), “Historian of fascism here. It was a Nazi salute - and a very belligerent one too.” But it’s not 2020, and we’re not falling for this again. We are, however, starting to notice that despite their _democratic_ defeat, these guys are still running the same playbook.
