### Free speech begins at 'fuck you'.

**I understand what it feels like to need a nation.**

I could have called this ‘A’ Black Nationalist Defense of Israel, but fuck you. That’s how I was raised, for better or worse. I can say that dispassionately because at this stage of my GenX life, I have enjoyed all the things my young, gifted and black life imagined. I still haven’t raced Porsches and I still have no big house in Pasadena nor have I gotten to the head of Rolex’ ridiculous waitlist. But all those are *desires* (from my teenage years) and my *needs* have been fulfilled. I am the black man I always wanted to be and America didn’t stop me. I have come to understand myself, my faith and my family. Most importantly on this particular subject I understand what it’s like to feel the need for a new nation, not to get that new nation and to find a home in this old nation as crazy as it sounds, but I reiterate as Danny DeVito, fuck you.

**Pegging Morality**  
The reason American and UK conservatives say ‘under God’ is to assert a supernatural sovereignty above the national interest. I think every human being has that god-shaped hole that requires transcendence. As soon as you are given a reason to believe some authority wants you to wager your life for any reason outside of what you imagine your life direction is worth, the proper response for a whole person is, once again, fuck you. The polite way to do that is to invoke the name of god, the word of god, the spirit of god. Whether you say ‘God’ or some version of Humanism or Gaia or Truth or Justice or the Laws of the Universe, it’s all the same.

***What matters is the transcendent rejection** **of any price put on your life.***

This is the fundamental question of anchoring your morality, or pegging your moral currency to a recognizable standard. Everybody cares about their own life, but when you are negotiating the value of your life, strangers need to understand your recourse. If I kill you, who is going to come after me? Karma? Gangbangers? Troops? Zealots? Naked blue haired pierced people on bikes? A cabal of influential programmers? The Dread Pirate Roberts? It’s not enough to be a goddamned individual. It’s you and what army?

This is the dilemma for anyone who rejects paternalism and condescension, both of which are a passive-aggressive sort of bullying. So do you punch them in the nose? Only if they get physical with you. If, your hostile encounter is on the interwebz and it takes the form of some sort of smug sophistry pushed into your face, fuck you is the appropriate non-lethal verbal response. Free speech starts at fuck you.

Who amongst us peasants can really afford much beyond the middle finger? Do we have time in our lifetimes to figure it out — to think our way around and outside of the box of our social identities? Well it was almost trivially easy for the Negro to assume the worst things about his commoditized state-granted identity. We were in a superposition of citizenship states, you simply needed to observe where we were and take some temperature or assess some measure of momentum. So we weaponized asymmetrically. Trickster blackfolks have often been that elusive; we learned not to be where we were assumed to be or where somebody else thought we ought to be. It’s not a lesson we taught the world, but the more I’ve studied the world and its people, the more common this tale sounds to me. Sometimes you feel like a nation. Sometimes you don’t.

**Pivot 1966**  
It’s hard to say exactly when the Negro decided to be Black Nationalist, because to my reckoning it was an intellectual and psychological advancement to simply be Black. No nation necessary. I keep telling that to people through [the poem of Nikki Giovanni](https://notegpt.io/share/22a9ca0ad) and I still never got a fraction of the backsheesh of Black Lives Matter while I held a much clearer grip on the truth. Nevertheless you can pretend they all arrived at the same time, even though they subatomically spin different. Let’s pretend it’s 1966. Years just after the Civil Rights Acts. Years just before Burn Baby Burn. Either way the bottom line for the nation was that the USA was presumed hostile, perhaps not to all of us with some final solution in the works, but with a clear and present Back To Africa refrain to the lyrics of struggle and complaint.

*I’d like to be your brother  
I’d like to live the same  
I want the level playing field  
So I can win the game*

*Oh why don’t you go back to Africa?  
Why don’t you go, black, to Africa?  
We don’t serve your kind  
Around here.  
  
*Brothers of my brothers in all the black tribes of America dreamed of the Promised Land. No money. New money. Old money. Our distinctions mattered like the difference between Peter and Paul, yet followers all. All we wanted was a deluxe apartment in the sky, the same sky everyone else could see. We didn’t trust ourselves so desperately to build a Mafia. We were too spread out. We were too many. Some of us looked too black. Some of us looked too white. So we glommed on, deciding to forge some kind of handshake natural dashiki Africanesque brotherhood simulacrum to nationhood in anticipation of a worldwide decolonized Marxist revolution. It might have been Super Fly. It might have been Shaft in Africa. It might have been Sounder. It might have been The Learning Tree. It might have been In the Heat of the Night, or Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? There were too many angles and flavor of black freedom, so I guess we had to call it a nation. Before WW2 there were as many Negros in the US as Jews in Europe. We weren’t reduced so much. We were as much a separate and unequal people as any. Some of us went to Africa, as with Liberia before.

**Pivot 1976**  
We, the black people of the United States of America, decided, not all at once, but you can pretend we did, that we were going to play it every which way instead of just one Black Nationalist way. We did so despite that thing that lead us to consider ourselves Black and to consider ourselves a nation of millions. There was that singular irrevocable force of alienation. We didn’t feel safe away from home. We felt like we were on borrowed time on borrowed territory when the demographic wasn’t majority minority. We pretended that ypipo were all still waiting for us to slip, like nobody really took integration seriously. We wore a mask beneath our mask. We still pretend it even in our diverse black and black-adjacent multitudes. What’s new about the pretense of unity? What’s new about the pretense of aggregated power? ‘Black’ still means what it meant even though blackness has changed.

That’s why, despite our multifarious actual ways, the echoes of Black unity remain. The rearguard has not died. They still revere Assata Shakur. They still focus on the hypersegregated. They still offer us Shaquanda Cotton and Trayvon Martin. And a new generation raised on Jordans and hoodies are in communion through an angry gangsta hiphop nation. Even as the [bourgies still boogie in Bamff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Brotherhood_of_Skiers), in declining numbers. Really? Skiing? Is that all? It never gets to be as exciting as Huey Newton. So you get the poster right next to your Eames chair.

**Nationalism**  
What is nationalism? It is a formalized generalization. It is sovereign even without a standing army. It is a tangible polity with a fluid fungible majority. But most of all it is a rejection of any non-self-determinism. To the external voice that puts a price on your freedom, it says fuck you. It refuses to be judged. It says I am that I am. Deal with me.

Once upon a time there was Zionism. Once upon a time there was Black Nationalism. The people and their dreams are here, now today. Constantly moving in the flow of history, sometimes cascading, sometimes eddying, sometimes catching others in their turbulent whirlpools.

If you know what it feels like to need a nation, even if you don’t get one, then you are a brother in that disparate brotherhood of aspiration. Somebody asked you a question but you heard an insult. How dare you say there is a Jewish question? How dare you say there is a Negro question? How dare you say there is a Palestinian question? What is constant is the rejection of the reductionist context. We will be what we’re going to be. What you think about that, we will consider tomorrow, maybe. In the meantime, fuck you.

Why do I say ‘fuck you’? Because nationhood is not necessarily noble. It is not necessarily well-considered. It simply demands the irrelevance of any external consul. It establishes a ‘we the people’ regardless. It might be good. It might be evil. It might be redundant. Nationhood is born when the people captivated by that idea get to that point at which they say your law is bullshit, here comes my law. Next comes the movement. It might just look like a migration. It might just look like a minority coalition. It might just look like a tottering Jenga pile of blockheads. It just might be hiding crazy glue and staples, but it just might demand ballots or bullets. Time will tell.

I would venture to say that 85% of black Americans have no interest in Black Nationalism. Black racial unity perhaps, but only within the context of American citizenship. Four out of five could not name the Nguzo Saba or sing more than one verse of the so-called Black National Anthem. Speaking for ‘us’, we ex-Black Nationalists were in many ways our own ‘Greatest Generation’, those that bore the idea that American law might just be bullshit. There are very few left the likes of Thurgood Marshall or Fannie Lou Hamer — men and women in their prime crushing the bones of racial segregation. Those of us who tired of hearing about the Negro Question. It turned out that we needed was the intellectual and psychological more than the land. It turned out that European Jews needed the land more than the intellectual and psychological. What the Palestinians need is their own Obama, but I’m not sure one is in the offing. They are way past needing the intellectual and psychological. The way it looks like from over here is they need to stop pretending anybody is going to give them a nation, or that they can win one in a war. I know. I recognize the fashion of ‘fuck you’. You can’t keep saying that for 70 years when you still don’t have a nation. Posters of Yasser Arafat, Assata Shakur, Mumia Abu Jamal. All propagandized ancestor worship.

I could go at length to describe the 1000 cuts that eliminated the landed part of the black nation — more accurate were 1000 redistricting gerrymanders. The creation of majority minority districts is the Affirmative Action nobody really wants to talk about. It created ‘the black community’. It is the actualization of that tangible polity with a fluid fungible majority. Black Americans made it a political rejection of any non-self-determinism. It comprised ‘the black vote’. It was the kind of deal that we took. But we didn’t let killers run the joint. We didn’t take money and guns from foreign countries. It didn’t take so much for us to get the picture. We wanted in. We didn’t want out. We wanted the ability to say ‘fuck you’ like a red-blooded American, by god Americans respected that. I don’t believe that the Gazans want to simply become Arab Israelis. I pity them for the leverage they get from radical outsiders.

**The Radical Outsider**  
As an American nationalist who respects the ‘under god’ transcendent exception to being 100% gung-ho, I’m in a position I’m not sure many Arab Muslims in Gaza and the West Bank understand. That’s because I recognize the reality of Christian practice that respects secular authority. It’s not clear to me that either of their territorial claims respect our concept of freedom of religion. I’m not sure that in their hundreds of mosques as in our thousands of black churches, that they had a spiritual rock that didn’t require armies of god. I’ve never sung “Onward Christian Soldiers” in any black church. That wasn’t the need.

I know that there are over 2 million non-Jews who are citizens in Israel. It might be that they live in their own virtual Jim Crow state of mind, but I can’t have much sympathy for that. Our movement really ended with Civil Rights, then we had to get our Negro minds right. Some never did, some broke themselves working for radical outsiders.

But you want to know who is the American domestic radical outsider? Brace yourself. It’s the black radical violent Nigger. And asymmetrical calling of his name invokes the dark-skinned boogie man that you are afraid of. Why, because you implicitly accept your political investment with race, and you’re not the right race. It’s that simple. If you are white, or white-adjacent or honorary white, then you are forever bound to the ‘original sin’ of American slavery, and the Niggers are forever bound to the existential threat of Nat Turner. You are defined in your politics to that myth-making.

**Links and Parallels**  
The Arab radical outsiders are just as easily bound to the existential threat of Saladin’s conquest of Jerusalem as black Americans are to our blackity-black rebels. Surely as there were radical scholars between the era of Crusades and Saladin’s conquest of Jerusalem we’ve had ours from 180 years or so since **Nat Turner** and **Cinque** became the boogiemen of this hemisphere. It’s less than period of time between the **Battle of Hattin** (1187) and the establishment of the **Ottoman Empire** (1299). The it took the Ottoman Empire more time to take over Gallipoli than for Barack Obama to take over the White House after the passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964. In short, a lot of change can take place driven by myth, ambition and cant.

My take is that, aligned with the premises of Walter Williams, there will be a black on black political war, perhaps with a division as clear as Shia vs Sunni with those who call upon the boogie man and those who call upon the acts of **Bayard Rustin** and **A. Phillip Randolph**. Nothing new about that division. Who is Drake and who is Kendrick Lamar? Some of us are not like us. This should be obvious to those who have disposed with racial mythology. I’m sorry if you’re not one of those people, but one doesn’t simply walk into Enlightenment.

The point here is simple. Blacks who want power can be split into factions, just as Muslims have. Who wants what kind of power? Well, the Black Nationalists wanted a certain kind and their myths are still with us today. Minding Malcolm X’ dictum of “By any means necessary”, some of the DEI contingent are indeed Critical Race Theorists and some are not. Race hides a lot of payloads, as does religion. Obviously not all black Americans play such trickster games, but we do have our Nationalist diehards.

**A Tearful Conversation  
**You may not know this about me, but when I engage someone in verbal combat, I tend to get teary eyed. I spent a couple hours having such [an extended battle of wits](https://github.com/dcvii/brainspew/blob/main/Before%20the%20PLO.md) with Grok and it was a doozy. In the end, I come out with some manner of pitiful sympathy for Palestinian Arabs whose own Great Migration was an order of magnitude less successful than our own from the South to other non-slave states here in America.

Yet at the same time I have a realistic eye for radical demands for power, and I think it has to be said more clearly than ever that Gazans have truly overplayed their hand. There is a certain dainty softness that black Americans have, never having truly taken up arms against this nation for our radical aims. We may have had gladiatorial martyrs like **Fred Hampton**, but in the end, he was no Colin Powell. Just another Nat Turner.

We really don’t compare in anything but abortive sentiment. Our willingness to co-opt the suicidally sympathetic in the broad diversity of American (and anti-American) pool of domestic sentiments is about as far as it goes. Really, little more than a couple Public Enemy albums full of ‘fuck you’. But I can say that at the beginning of this essay, and in my formative years I felt it slightly more than symbolically. Yet once again, never enough to take up arms. Never enough to start chopping heads for 40 lousy acres and a mealy mouthed mule.

In my extended conversation I never ventured much prior to WW1. There was quite enough catastrophe in the fall of the Ottoman Empire to negate all transcendent ambitions that may have lived through Muslim mythology back to Saladin, so yeah sorry about that. In the end I still think a two state solution is all but impossible.

Here’s what’s new in my understanding.

1. al-Husseini, most definitely predates all of the political groups and must be said to be the father of Palestinian nationalism.
2. King Abdullah, leader of the Hashemites in Jordan basically didn’t give two shits for al-Husseini and his cause because.  
	A. al-Husseini was a Nazi sympathizer  
	B. Abdullah had his own land-grab planned for ‘Greater Syria’  
	C. He cut a deal with Golda Meir.
3. Husseini was in competition with another putative leader, Nashashibi. It was a family rivalry.
4. Egypt has done the Palestinians no favors whatsoever. They are the original occupiers of Gaza.

I am wanting to, for a stretched sort of parallel, think of Palestinians as Blacks, and the pre-Nakba Arabs as Negroes. But it doesn’t really fit. Their nationalist impulse was born out of a failed coup attempt aimed squarely at Zionists, who were just nationalist Jews. Nationalist Jews are no more or less deserving than Nationalist Arabs, but the Jews were simply better organized by the end of WW2. Our Black Nationalist impulse was not so very militant that we would let half of our population be annexed and absorbed into another country like Jordan, discounting the small role of the **American Colonization Society** and their little boat trips to Liberia. Ours was only symbolically revolutionary. So I’m still convinced as I have been for a couple decades, that black Americans have simply never suffered enough to arm up and go to war since 1863. So our Black Nationalist impulse was a bourgie blip.

Again, I cannot get any handle on the extent of the alienation and hatred felt by those Palestinians who suffered their own version of Jim Crow. But Jim Crow ain’t slavery. So were we Coloreds too weak? Well, not with the 14th and 15th Amendments.

Ultimately my aim was to identify Arab agency, see how they split up and joined up among those Arab states, politics and sentiments that left some deciding to become Israeli citizens, some to leave for the diaspora, some to follow Fatah / PLO et al. The P Arabs seem to have been co-opted and tried to join every anti-Zionist bandwagon rolling through the desert. And why wouldn’t they if they already gave up on Transjordanian citizenship? No love from the Hashemites who cut deals with the Brits.

Some went to Syria and Lebanon. Syria gave them what amounted to a phony “Right of Return” residency green card that turned out to be worthless when that nation fell into civil war and starvation. Egypt literally commandeered them into forced labor in Gaza, worse than sharecropping. It’s practically a perfect storm of abuse - as much as just about any nation can get away with. Then again in it’s own way it was like some refusing to raise stakes out of Mississippi or temporarily moving to Kentucky and actually expecting those 40 acres. That’s a kind of soul destruction.

Buffalo?  
A closer parallel might be more like Buffalo Soldiers out to grab land at the end of the Indian Wars, then finding themselves stranded in Kansas for 100 years until today. Or maybe in California with the 49ers. But we have been citizens

In the end, we have free speech and we can say ‘fuck you’ to anyone and everyone, but nobody is going to make a new nation on the North American continent. Nobody has enough he gripe, guts or guns.
