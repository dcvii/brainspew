There has always been a fundamental problem with SPARQL: you need to understand the data model to use it. This can be a major limitation, especially when your data model consists of many OWL models constructed from different subordinate ontologies written by various standards bodies. I would also argue that because OWL is built on logical relationships, this process requires a deep understanding of the problem domain.

There are a few solutions to this - one is to provide a limited subset of queries that can be parameterised (as I’ve discussed in a recent paper). There are benefits to doing things this way, with the SPARQL being very general but constrained in such a way as to provide a certain degree of abstraction of the underlying graph. However, you still need to have someone write those queries.

A second alternative would be to use SHACL 1.2 node expressions, as discussed in my recent series on the capabilities of that language, but by itself, that specification is still in its infancy. There are some interesting design patterns and methodologies that can emerge from this approach, but this doesn’t necessarily resolve the natural language query aspect.

## Generating SHACL from Data

A final alternative would be to GENERATE SHACL 1.2 (or even just 1.1) from a known data graph from the source data via AI, modify it as appropriate, then use the SHACL to generate the SPARQL queries. I’ll discuss this approach in this post.

SHACL does not provide a logical inference schema (not directly, anyway); instead, it is primarily structural in nature and typically deals with lower-level classes, properties, and constraints. It is foundational, with OWL systems or others providing a higher-order reasoning capability, when utilized correctly. However, with the structural underpinnings in place, you have what’s needed to provide better queries.

Note as well that there is nothing keeping you from having both an OWL and a SHACL schema for a given dataset. This is fairly important, because it means that even if you do have an existing RDF database, a SHACL schema can be turned on or off without impacting the dataset. Finally, those SHACL graphs are likely to be very tiny compared to most data graphs. Tiny is good when dealing with AI because a SHACL schema can readily fit into an AI context whereas storing the entire database into the context will likely be unworkable.

*In the examples discussed here, I used Anthropic’s Claude Model Opus 4.5. As a caveat, this was not vibe computing. At every step you should review the artefacts produced, just as you should with any AI generated content.*

## Building a Data Source

The first step involved data acquisition. You do not need the entire dataset that you’re working with, but you should obtain a sufficiently large sample to see patterns; as a rule of thumb, a spreadsheet is probably ideal for that. If you’re building a dataset from scratch, you can also generate such a dataset from a prompt. For instance,

```markup
create a dataset in Turtle showing fifteen DC superheroes (male and female) and supervillains (male and female) showing their gender, relative age, appearance, superpowers, where located, and their primary love interests, principle antagonists, and associated organizations. For gender, superpowers, locations love interests, antagonists and organisations, make each of these IRIs with corresponding entries rather than literals.
```

After thinking for a it, the AI generates a file (here with about 800 lines, a few of which are shown here):

```markup

A few quick notes - the namespaces largely align with classes, which works very well with a structural approach to schemas. Almost all connections that describe relationships are to IRIs rather than strings. The more that you can do this, the richer your dataset will be. Most of the relational code is in RDFS, which provides domain and range information but little else. There’s also very little in the way of an upper ontology, because that requires inferencing along subdomains. If you have these, you can likely obtain richer, more conditional SHACL, but the above is a reasonable bare minimum.

Once you have this sample (as a turtle file or similar resource), then you can generate the SHACL via an AI with the following prompt:

```markup
# Claude Prompt

For this dataset, construct  a SHACL schema. All node and property shapes should have understandable IRIs and be given by reference.
```

The output of this property is a SHACL 1.1 schema (change to SHACL 1.2 in the prompt to get a more refined version of same).

This is a sound skeletal schema. It infers cardinality relationships, establishes constraints about what is allowed vs non-allowed enumerations, incorporates appropriate metadata, including error messages, and uses SHACL-SPARQL constructs that can in turn be used to inform SPARQL queries down the road.

It is worth taking the time to check these validations. This provides a considerably richer schema and can also be used to validate the broader dataset.

If you have a SHACL 1.2 validator, it may be worth generating SHACL 1.2. A sample of this can be seen as follows (for a node expression):

```markup
dcsh:HeroHasVillainAntagonistExpression a sh:NodeExpression ;
    rdfs:label “Hero Has Villain Antagonist Expression” ;
    rdfs:comment “SHACL 1.2 node expression: checks that heroes have at least one villain antagonist” ;
    sh:message “Hero should have at least one villain as antagonist” ;
    sh:severity sh:Info ;
    # sh:exists returns true if the nested expression yields at least one node
    sh:exists [
        a sh:NodeExpression ;
        # sh:nodes navigates from focus node along a path
        sh:nodes [ sh:path dc:hasAntagonist ] ;
        # sh:filterShape filters to only nodes matching the shape
        sh:filterShape [ sh:class dc:Villain ]
    ] .
```

If you have the information in files or a triple store that supports validation, you should test it against your dataset to determine whether any violations occur. Note that the goal here is not to test the dataset itself, but rather to calibrate the schema so that it validates properly.

## Creating SPARQL from SHACL and Claude

Once you are comfortable with the SHACL, you use it with Claude to generate a SPARQL statement from a prompt:

```markup
Based solely on the Dc characters SHACL, create a SPARQL query that will answer the question: “Which character has the greatest number of connections, either as a love interest, a foe, or a member of the same organizations as the character?”
```

This generates the following SPARQL file:

```markup
# =============================================================================
# SPARQL Query: Character with Greatest Number of Connections
# Derived from: dc-characters-shacl.ttl
# =============================================================================
#
# Property paths derived from SHACL PropertyShapes:
#   - dcsh:CharacterShape-hasLoveInterest → dc:hasLoveInterest → dc:Character
#   - dcsh:CharacterShape-hasAntagonist   → dc:hasAntagonist   → dc:Character
#   - dcsh:CharacterShape-memberOf        → dc:memberOf        → dc:Organization
#
# Connections are counted as:
#   1. Love interests (bidirectional - either direction counts)
#   2. Foes/antagonists (bidirectional - either direction counts)
#   3. Co-members of shared organizations (other characters in same org)
#
# Each unique connected character is counted once per relationship type.

        }
        GROUP BY ?character
    }
}
ORDER BY DESC(?totalConnections) ?characterName
LIMIT 20
```

This query can then be applied directly to the triplestore or to a file. For the sample dataset, this might produce a result like the following:

## Summary

There are several points worth noting.

- You develop the SHACL schema once (though you may augment it), in effect by training it with the raw data coming from the data set.
- You create a SPARQL query with the SHACL once for every AI prompt. In this case, the SHACL tells the LLM the structure of the knowledge graph, and can use that information to then create a prompt that matches the output.
- The SPARQL can then be applied procedurally to the broader graph, bypassing the AI.
- At no time is the knowledge graph itself loaded into the AI context via LangChain; only the query results are. This keeps the active context small and manageable, and significantly reduces the overhead for RAG.
- Once you have the SHACL, the source data can be anything - a table, a PDF file, an LLM, an image, etc., because you can use the SHACL to create an intermediate RDF turtle file that acts as your triple store source.
- Note that if you have an existing SHACL file that you want to map to, this can go a long way toward building a general queryable system: the data file can be converted into RDF using SHACL and uploaded to an existing triple store. The SHACL can be used to generate a relevant query across the entire data store to identify additional connections.
- Because you’re not actually querying the LLM for data, the token cost is pretty minimal - a one-time cost for the schema, a cost for translating non-RDF data into turtle using that schema (if necessary), and a one-time cost per query (part of which may be recouped if you can parameterise that query).
- Finally, if the output of this is a data graph or table, there is no need to transform the production through the LLM; what is returned is a high-accuracy data structure. Certainly, you can apply post-transformers (such as JSON filters, XSLT converters, or, of course, LLMs) to the resulting data, but this is likely to yield data with very good fidelity compared to an LLM, with a predictable structure and a mechanism for structural validation.
