BARCELONA—Power began to return to parts of Spain and Portugal as nightfall approached after a major electrical outage caused widespread disruption to the Iberian Peninsula.

Businesses, hospitals and other critical infrastructure in Spain and Portugal were forced to rely on backup generators and homes were without electricity as authorities scrambled to identify the cause of Monday’s blackout.

Big power swings caused Spain’s system to disconnect from the European grid, said Eduardo Prieto, head of operation services at [Red Eléctrica](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ES/XMAD/RED), the country’s grid operator.

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Monday evening power had been restored in parts of the north and the south with the assistance of authorities in France and Morocco.

Roughly half of the power capacity on the Peninsula had been restored by late Monday, [Red Eléctrica said](https://x.com/RedElectricaREE/status/1916964594066628845).

Luís Montenegro, the prime minister of Portugal, [said work was under way](https://x.com/lmontenegro_pt/status/1916918762441216120?s=46&t=mc2vHozZJYYzru9DdSGqTQ) to restore full power to the nation.

The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity said initial investigations pointed to a technical or cable issue, adding that it was monitoring the situation closely. António Costa, president of the European Council, said there were [no indications](https://x.com/eucopresident/status/1916859055546544517?s=46&t=mc2vHozZJYYzru9DdSGqTQ) of any cyberattack at this point.

Sanchez urged citizens to avoid speculating about the cause of the outage and to turn to official channels for information.

Portuguese grid operator [Redes Energéticas Nacionais](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PT/XLIS/RENE) said changes of temperature in Spain affected the frequency on power lines. That can damage equipment and cause generators to be cut off automatically, potentially leading to widespread outages, said Victor Becerra, a power systems expert at the University of Portsmouth in the U.K.

“The loss of large generators can create a sudden and significant imbalance between power supply and demand in the power grid, potentially escalating into widespread outages,” he said.

Europe’s highly connected power grid, designed to pool power between countries and increase resilience, can be a double-edged sword, he added. “This interconnectivity also means that disruptions can spread quickly across national borders,” Becerra said.

Over 150 flights in and out of Spain and Portugal were canceled on Monday, with hundreds more delayed due to the outage, according to flight tracking specialist, FlightAware.

In Spain, airports were operating with power from backup generators, with the number of takeoffs and landings reduced by as much as 30%, the government said. TAP Air Portugal, the country’s flag carrier, said operations were “very limited” and was advising customers not to travel to the airport for their flight until notified.

Adif, the operator of Spain’s railway infrastructure, said all train services had been suspended until further notice, and subway service was halted in major cities. By Monday evening, authorities were still working to evacuate passengers from 26 stalled trains.

In central Barcelona, trams stood frozen on their tracks on Monday afternoon and people formed long lines to board buses, which were still running. Foot traffic was high on pedestrian streets.

Many bars and coffee shops in the city were closed. Kiosk workers said they had no way to take payments.

Ice cream shops were doling out cones as fast as they could before their wares melted. People raided the few supermarkets open for water, bread, candles and other supplies in case the outages lasted through the night.

Achille Donato, a manager at the Four Points by Sheraton Barcelona Diagonal hotel, said the hotel was fully booked but expected many cancellations. It was unclear how many people would cancel, however, since their phones were down, he said.

Spanish authorities advised drivers against using the roads, saying traffic lights and other signage weren’t working due to the outage.

Cellphone signal was disrupted in parts of the country. Vodafone Spain said its network was 70% active with the use of generators, while Orange, another operator, asked customers to use their phones to communicate only if strictly necessary to avoid overwhelming the network.

ATMs have been disrupted by the outage but online banking and payments systems are working, Sanchez said.

A spokesperson for Spain’s stock-exchange operator said markets were operating as usual despite the outage. Carmaker Seat, owned by [Volkswagen](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW3), said it had halted operations at its plant in Martorell, Spain, due to the outage.

By mid-evening Monday, power had come back for parts of the Basque region, Madrid, Catalonia—home to Barcelona—and La Rioja, according to Red Eléctrica. Electricity service also resumed in parts of Aragon, Galicia, Asturias, Navarre, Castile and León, the grid operator said.
