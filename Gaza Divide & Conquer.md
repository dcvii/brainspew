TL;DR: Hamas is militarily exhausted and unpopular; Israel is mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists to finish retaking Gaza, carve it into controlled zones that strip Hamas of its civilian shield, and negotiate piecemeal capitulations for remaining hostages. The endgame seems to be a partitioned, demilitarized Gaza run by local administrations under enduring Israeli security oversight.

q/What's the endgame in Gaza?![ðŸ§µ](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t3f/2/16/1f9f5.png)

The IDF is drafting 10,000s as operation 'Gideon's Chariots'. It's a long time since Gaza posed a strategic threat, but it still exists as a festering sore, holding 24 hostages & 35 bodies. So what will the endgame be? Divide and conquer: (1/12)

In the six weeks since the end of the ceasefire, which lasted two months from January 19 to March 18, the IDF has been slowly reoccupying the buffer zone between Israel and Gaza, widening it and clearing it of buildings and shrubbery, and carefully reoccupying the Netzarim Corridor.

The 60-day ceasefire allowed Hamas to reestablish traps and mine tracks and roads the IDF had been using, and so what is essentially a skeleton force has been working methodically, re-clearing areas from which it withdrew for the ceasefire.

Only a handful of IDF troops have been killed in action during these six weeks, and apart from a few ambushes and incidents where troops triggered booby traps, Hamas seems to have largely melted away from direct confrontation. (2/12)

There is little remaining of the pre-war Hamas force: Of around 30,000 trained fighters they had in October 2023, at least 21,000 are dead, at least 4,000 are in Israeli detention, and by battlefield logic alone, thousands more are wounded to the point of no longer being fit to fight.

Claims of Hamas recruiting tens of thousands of new troops seem dubious and likely just Hamas propaganda laundered through their allies. These lies get repeated since they serve the goals of people on all sides. Even if true, Hamas has no way to train them, and so they will be little more than "one-way attack troops", running at tanks with IEDs. (3/12)

Hamas is also profoundly unpopular among the population of Gaza.

As people survey the rubble and the desolation Hamas brought upon them for no discernible results, they can't believe that for the sake of keeping 20-24 living hostages in tunnels beneath themâ€”to protect and keep in power their Hamas tormentorsâ€”they will be forced to endure a second hot summer in tents, eating rations. (4/12)

For every Gazan willing to march in protest against Hamas, risking their lives and facing arrest and torture, there are ten Gazans willing to share information in return for lucrative rewards and tickets to a new life in the West.

This is no doubt why, when Israel ended the ceasefire on March 18, it was able to immediately eliminate senior Hamas operatives who had previously eluded the IDF. (5/12)

It was clear for a long time, even before the ceasefire, that the IDF knew where nearly all the hostages were, sometimes precisely. It's even possible Hamas telegraphed their locations to the IDF to use a perimeter around the hostage sites as safe zones for their activities.

The daring and near-miraculous raid that freed Noa Armagani, Shlomi Ziv, Almog Meir Jan, and Andrey Kozlov on June 8 was always going to come at a cost: Security for the remaining hostages was stepped up significantly. This became clear from the execution of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, and four others on August 30. (6/12)

The Gazans have had enough, and polls show most want to leave their ravaged coastal strip to start anew elsewhere. They are currently trickling out in a slow but largely unpublicized exodus via Ramon Airport and the Jordanian border. Some are genuine humanitarian cases, but others likely betrayed Hamas, and their ticket out, along with a visa to a foreign nation, is part of the quid pro quo Israel has offered them.

Hamas is hopelessly depleted, entirely cut off from resupply for 19 months now. There is no celebratory gunfire in Gaza, not just because they are losing, but because every bullet is precious. From firing off hundreds of rockets a day, they now manage perhaps one a month or fewer. They are a spent force, entirely outclassed and surrounded. (7/12)

So what's next? The IDF is calling up large numbers of reservists, the largest mobilization in a year (and despite calls from the far-left for service refusal, the response rate has been 102%). With the northern front pacified and the West Bank situation under control, these troops are heading for Gaza. The cabinet has approved a plan to conquer all of Gaza.

It's certainly not a problem for the IDF to do this. At various points, the IDF has occupied nearly all of Gaza, avoiding parts like Deir el-Balah and certain neighborhoods in central Gaza City where it knew hostages were held. (8/12)

These reservists serve a double purpose: Pressuring Hamas into a hostage deal by signaling the current skeleton force that has been reshaping the battlefield will soon be reinforced with serious firepower, and also becoming that firepower to begin a final assault on Gaza.

But how could Israel conquer Gaza, paving the way for a "day after" plan while giving the hostages a survival chance? The answer will involve a form of "divide and rule," or rather, "divide and let others rule."

The major push by the IDF into previously unoccupied territory over the last six weeks has been into the "Morag Corridor," named for an Israeli village that once stood along the route. Previously, it seemed the IDF would use this corridor to divide Rafah from Khan Yunis. However, with Rafah almost entirely ruined, the Morag corridor will instead form the eastern perimeter of an IDF-occupied zone reaching to the Egyptian border, comprising about 10% of Gaza's territory. (9/12)

Rumors suggest Israel is planning a large refugee camp in this area, completely separating a large part of Gazaâ€™s population from Hamas.

The pre-war population of Gaza Strip was variously reported as 1.9â€“2.1 million but was certainly overstated. Multiple lines of evidence point to a real pre-war population of about 1.5 million. Palestinians had reasons to exaggerate births and suppress death and emigration numbers, with little incentive for Israelis to contradict these claims. Evidence from early in the war, when many with travel documents or means left for Egypt, shows around 100,000 to 200,000 Gazans exited. (10/12)

Thus, Hamas can be isolated in two ways, both pursued by the IDF: Firstly, removing its human shield population, leaving them vulnerable to conventional warfare. Hamasâ€™ war strategy relies on these human shieldsâ€”the thinner the population they hide among, the weaker they become. Losing the population also deprives Hamas of income, meaning less ideologically driven recruits will leave as resources dry up.

Secondly, Hamas can be isolated from itself. Negotiations with a centralized Hamas have proven largely fruitless, particularly since Hamas knows releasing hostages removes their leverage. However, if Gaza is divided into parcels, isolating Hamas divisions, each can be dealt with individually. In the past, entire Hamas divisions surrendered under pressure rather than face inevitable death. Even death cults have limits. By isolating Hamas strongholds, Israel can negotiate directly for hostage releases, bypassing Hamas leadership. (11/12)

Once isolated, Hamas leadership effectively loses control, ceasing to exist as an organization. Israel can make individual deals with division commanders, arranging safe passage to third countries.

Those claiming Israel canâ€™t occupy Gaza short- to medium-term ignore history. Israel has held up to 50% of Gaza with minimal troop numbers sustainably.

Once Gaza is partitioned, and the IDF has established bases enabling access to Hamas-free towns, arrangements for Gaza's long-term governance can begin.

Most likely, each city will gain self-governance under a fully demilitarized arrangement, surrounded and bisected by Israeli buffer zones, similar to the West Bank. (12/12)/q
