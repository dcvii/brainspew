None of us—not even Peter Thiel—will live to be 250. But the polities we create can last a very long time, if they do not expire in their infancy.

In 2026, the United States will celebrate a quarter of a millennium since the [Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript). Many people since Donald Trump’s return to power have taken to worrying that it will not last much longer. “I think this is how a republic dies,” [Andrew Sullivan](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-permanent-stain) wrote back in August. Substack probably runs one essay a day on this theme. A month later, [Zack Beauchamp](https://www.vox.com/politics/462076/trump-democracy-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk) gave us “This Is How Trump Ends Democracy,” an essay notable for the sentence “Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension... has shown us how authoritarianism can come to America.” He added, in the style of an indignant teenager: “I mean this literally.”

I have [argued elsewhere](https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/no-liberals-donald-trump-us-dictatorship-09n72dgd7) why I continue to regard such fears as hyperbolic. But how surprising would it be if the American republic really did die on our watch? To address that question, it helps to know something about the history of republics.

The American colonists were not the first people in history to replace a monarchy with a republic. The northern provinces of the Low Countries had rebelled against Spanish rule in 1568, and 13 years later established the Dutch Republic. The United Provinces prospered and grew mighty.

The English had overthrown and, in 1649, executed King Charles I, instituting a Commonwealth of England—also a republic, which later added Scotland and Ireland to its domain. This one had less happy results. The Commonwealth lasted only 11 years and from 1653 was a dictatorship under its Puritan Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell. In 1660, the monarchy was restored under King Charles II.

It wasn’t until much later, in 1795, that the United Provinces vanished from the historical scene, defeated by the armies of another revolutionary republic: France. Having successfully struck a balance between Protestants and Catholics, Amsterdam and the agricultural provinces, bourgeois frugality and imperial ambition, the Dutch Republic had lasted 214 years.

The Founding Fathers of the United States thus understood very well that they might build as mighty an empire as the Dutch Republic—but they might also fail as ignominiously as the English Commonwealth. That they triumphed was not a result of “manifest destiny.” It was more the result of applied history. For the authors of *[The](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9798217154555)* *[Federalist Papers](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9798217154555)* —Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay—consciously sought to learn the lessons of previous failed republics.

“It is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece and Italy,” wrote Hamilton in *Federalist No. 9*, “without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy.”

The authors of *The Federalist Papers* —Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay—consciously sought to learn the lessons of previous failed republics.

Republics had other recurrent maladies, too. In *Federalist No. 10*, Madison saw “faction”—we would now say partisan politics—as a source of “instability, injustice, and confusion.” And both Madison and Hamilton saw confederal structures as too weak to last, due to their lack of a dominant central authority. As Hamilton argued, the key to avoiding these pitfalls lay in exploiting the insights of the new “science of politics” that had flourished in Europe in the Enlightenment. That meant designing a constitution based on the separation of powers, an independent judiciary, and representative rather than direct democracy. The constitution hammered out at the Convention in Philadelphia deliberately combined the best elements of democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy to make sure the republic had a Dutch rather than an English lifespan.

Much ink has been spilled over the question of “American exceptionalism.” As we have seen, there was nothing especially novel about the republican form of government *per se*. Nor, despite the distortions and misrepresentations of The 1619 Project, was there anything exceptional about the existence of chattel slavery in the southern American states. The phenomenon of unfree labor had been common in most regions and most centuries up until that time.

Rather, the exceptional character of the United States lay in its constitutional solution to an age-old problem: how to have a republic that provided its citizens not just with security, but also with liberty and prosperity. That was the goal set by the Declaration of Independence: to secure for “the People... certain unalienable Rights... among these... Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”

It took a Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, to appreciate how remarkable this achievement was—the subject of his classic *[Democracy in America](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780226805368)*, published in the 1830s. French history, after all, is American history as it might have been, but for the exquisite design of the Constitution. There have been five French republics since 1792. The first lasted 12 years, the second 4, the third 70, the fourth 12, and the latest will turn 68 in 2026.

Will a French republic ever celebrate its 250th anniversary? I would doubt it. The authoritarian and egalitarian temptations will always be too strong. And the same could be said of all the Latin American republics, which have had so many different constitutions over their lifetimes that it is hard to keep count. The characteristic feature of both Portuguese-speaking and Spanish-speaking republics has been their susceptibility to revolutions and coups, veering between chaos and caudillos.

The exceptional character of the United States lay in its constitutional solution to an age-old problem: how to have a republic that provided its citizens not just with security, but also with liberty and prosperity.

Yet, as the Dutch case illustrates, the history of republics isn’t exclusively one of failure. In truth, Hamilton was a trifle harsh about ancient and medieval republics. Some were exceptionally durable. Carthage was a republic; it lasted more than six centuries before being destroyed by its Roman rival. Rome itself managed nearly half a millennium (482 years) as a republic before the emperors took charge. Athens nearly made it to 200. The republics of Genoa, Novgorod, and Ragusa all lasted many centuries. And *La Serenissima*, Venice, survived more than a millennium as a republic.

Nor should we overlook the remarkable success of Switzerland, despite its having ignored everything Hamilton ever wrote about the need for a federal government with strong central institutions. The Swiss have been running a confederal republic with highly decentralized politics for half a millennium. They don’t even have a proper president—just a Federal Council—a seven-member committee, no member of which you would recognize in the street. And their cantons continue to enjoy powers that the more disgruntled American states would kill for.

If anything, it has been more recent republics—those born in the 20th centuries—that have been subject to, in Hamilton’s nice phrase, “a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy.” The case most commonly cited by today’s compulsive worriers is the German Weimar Republic, which lasted from 1919 to 1933. The Spanish Republic of 1931 to1939 was even more fleeting. And, of course, a very significant proportion of the republics formed in the age of decolonization have been afflicted by bouts of both tyranny and anarchy. Of the 142 new sovereign states established after 1945, more than 100 started out with republican constitutions. Today nearly all are republics, but it cannot be claimed that many of these post-colonial republics have done much for the liberty of their citizens.

For all these reasons, I remain skeptical about all the warnings of excitable journalists and professors that the American republic faces a mortal threat in the person of Donald Trump. For 10 years, I have been reading that he is the reincarnation of either Julius Caesar or Adolf Hitler. I have consistently taken the other side of the bets that we are either Rome or Weimar. My reasons for optimism are twofold.

First, the Founders saw Trump coming and designed their constitution accordingly. “It is only to consult the history of nations,” [Hamilton wrote](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-18-02-0305-0002) in 1795, “to perceive, that every country, at all times, is cursed by the existence of men who, actuated by an irregular ambition, scruple nothing which they imagine will contribute to their own advancement and importance.” Republics, he argued, were especially vulnerable to “fawning or turbulent demagogues, worshipping still the idol power wherever placed... and trafficking in the weaknesses, vices, frailties, or prejudices” of the people. That was precisely why the Constitution had to be designed to limit the power of the president, as sooner or later such a man was certain to attain that office.

Nothing we have seen in the past year indicates the imminent breakdown of the system of checks and balances Hamilton and his contemporaries devised. People in Cambridge or Berkeley may fantasize that they are living In *[It Can’t Happen Here](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780451465641)* (1935), *[The Handmaid’s Tale](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780385490818)* (1985), or *[The Plot Against America](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781400079490)* (2004), but they really aren’t.

The website [Just Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/) tracks legal challenges to Trump administration executive actions. Of 552 cases, the plaintiffs have won 186, the government has won 113, and the remainder are either awaiting a court ruling, closed, or temporarily blocked. And this is Trump’s fifth year in government. Rest assured, this was not how German courts worked in 1938.

In the same way, it is too early to write Congress off as a mere rubber stamp for the White House. The Republican majorities in the Senate and House alike are wafer-thin. Trump’s current polling is strongly reminiscent of other second terms as they approach their second year. The consensus view is that the Democrats will regain the House next November. This is not the crisis of the republic. It is politics as usual.

My second reason for optimism is the observation that, if republics get through their infancy, they can last a remarkably long time. A great many republics last fewer than 20 years. But most of the rest last more than a century, with two (Venice and obscure little San Merino) exceeding a millennium. In other words, the lifespans of republics are not normally distributed along a bell curve—rather, the tails of the distribution are flat. My hypothesis is that, after a certain point, perhaps after a couple of generations, the institutions of republican life bed down and become the familiar norm: In short, they become traditions.

This reflection is the result of listening to the wonderful archive of Alistair Cooke’s *[Letter from America](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f6hbp)*, a weekly BBC radio show that ran from March 1946 until February 2004—a longer lifespan than achieved by many 20th-century republics. Each week, Cooke would spend 15 minutes reflecting on American life, in his mellifluous transatlantic accent—a mix of Lancashire, Cambridge, and Manhattan—for an audience that extended far beyond the British Isles.

I grew up hearing Cooke regularly, as my grandfather—a journalist of a slightly earlier vintage—admired his wry style. Revisiting the Cooke archive from the 1970s, I am struck again and again by his skill at capturing the seasons of the United States: from the frigid winters of that era, especially in the Midwest, to the cherry-blossom spring in Washington; from July 4 through the sybaritic summer of New England to Labor Day; and on to Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s. The political and sporting calendars are interwoven, most obviously when an election coincides with the World Series, but also when the football and primary seasons overlap.

Listening to Cooke, you see history unfold in weekly installments, each presidency beginning with lofty aspirations and invariably ending in sad disillusionment if not abject ignominy; each new social movement—“women’s lib,” “black power,” “homosexual rights,” as they were originally known in Cooke’s time—crashing like a wave on a vast beach. America evolves, yes. But it also endures, its perennial rhythms passed lovingly from generation to generation.

July 4 is half a year away, it’s true. Perhaps in the coming six months, the Cassandras will be vindicated: The courts will capitulate, the Congress will burn, and the republic will succumb to the tyrant Trump. But I wouldn’t bet on it. History suggests that, so long as it doesn’t lose a major war (a subject for another column), a republic that has lasted 250 years has a good chance of lasting at least another few hundred.

So happy birthday, United States, when it comes. Here’s to the next 250 years—indeed, to the next 750. Eventually, no doubt, your vast empire will wane, as Venice’s did, and your magnificence will be, like the Piazza San Marco, that of a mere tourist destination. But that fate still seems distant. To paraphrase [Benjamin Franklin](https://constitutioncenter.org/education/classroom-resource-library/classroom/perspectives-on-the-constitution-a-republic-if-you-can-keep-it?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21525850510&gbraid=0AAAAADl4wpOS72lxjKWxE9li3E_qn6drG&gclid=Cj0KCQiAx8PKBhD1ARIsAKsmGbeqAV1O7GiqynKOJDjJVPvfosDj7m3pS3EucStN4VgEKbjv_i6h60saAuOTEALw_wcB), it’s a republic—and we’ve kept it. Now it’s just a case of not throwing it away.
