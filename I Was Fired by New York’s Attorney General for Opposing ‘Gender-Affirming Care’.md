On January 15, New York attorney general Letitia James—who was, at the time, my boss—accused me of engaging in “disruptive public speech.”

What had I done to deserve this charge? I had repeatedly spoken and written about my concerns regarding pediatric gender medicine—that is, the practice of blocking children’s puberty, administering cross-sex hormones to teens, and subjecting them to breast and genital surgery.

As a lesbian, I care passionately about the safety of gender nonconforming youth. I am also experienced in identifying consumer fraud, and I am troubled by how vulnerable patients in psychological distress are being misled.

When James leveled her accusation at me, I’d been working as a lawyer in the New York Attorney General’s office for four years. In that time, I’d watched her file amicus briefs in support of pediatric gender medicine and battle against restrictions at both the federal level and in other states.

When I expressed my concerns about such full-throated support, I was at best ignored, at worst threatened. Last April, when I was trying to discuss my views, a colleague told me: “If you say one more word on this subject, I’m calling HR.”

And all this came to a head that day, January 15, when I was told that, unless I resigned—or agreed to “cease from engaging in any unapproved, disruptive speech immediately”—I would be fired in a week.

As a lawyer who knows my constitutional rights, and as an advocate for gay youth, these terms were unacceptable.

So last week, on the afternoon of January 22, I rescued my space heater from the office and rode the subway home—awaiting dismissal. At 5.08 p.m., the email came through. My position had been “terminated effective immediately” and I was “barred from entering the premises.”

I began as an assistant attorney general in James’s consumer frauds bureau in January 2022. My work there focused on protecting low-income New Yorkers; I held debt collectors accountable and sued a furniture finance company for violating usury laws.

Around the same time, I began looking into the issue of pediatric gender medicine. I’d become concerned after hearing a lesbian detransitioner on a podcast explain the disturbing side effects she’d suffered: painful [vaginal atrophy](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8814107/) caused by taking testosterone and permanent [nerve damage](https://www.cancercenter.com/cancer-types/breast-cancer/life-after-breast-cancer/postmastectomy-pain-syndrome) from her double mastectomy that limited her range of motion.

I wanted to make sure I understood both sides of the story, so I began researching the explanations of gender doctors. What I found shocked me: The explanations were incoherent. The definition of gender identity seemed circular: “A man is someone who identifies as a man.” And the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) repeatedly [implied gender identity](https://www.aclu-ia.org/press-releases/aclu-iowa-statement-protections-transgender-iowans-after-july-1-law-change/) has a [biological basis](https://share.google/18DHzxlC60KCZUdsI), yet it couldn’t back that up with studies. I later learned why—because it’s [false](https://www.city-journal.org/article/transgender-brain-sex-studies-flawed).

Despite growing evidence that the practice was unsafe, the attorney general continued to side with providers of pediatric gender medicine*.*

I felt compelled to do something, so I decided to research and write about the issue on my own time. In November 2023, I started a blog called *Bad Facts*. In one piece, I [analyzed](https://badfacts.substack.com/p/the-trans-child-media-blitz) the flood of pediatric gender medicine puff pieces published between 2006 and 2008, around when America’s first [gender youth clinic center](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/health/transgender-youth-st-louis-jamie-reed.html) opened. In others, I debunked gender doctors’ pseudoscientific claims (that [gender identity is biological](https://badfacts.substack.com/p/the-aclus-big-lie); that their practices are “ [evidence-based](https://badfacts.substack.com/p/can-evidence-based-medicine-take) ”) and latent homophobia (psychologists are taught that a patient’s “ [discordant” feelings](https://badfacts.substack.com/p/the-psychologists-role-in-transitioning) about their homosexuality could mean they are transgender). By the time I was fired, I had published 60 essays there.

Initially I wrote under a pseudonym to preserve my career as a progressive public interest lawyer. But as time went on, that felt more and more ridiculous. By October 2024, I was writing under my own name.

Around the same time, I proposedjoining a multistate fraud investigation into the American Academy of Pediatrics, one of the biggest boosters of pediatric gender medicine. Given my research, I felt New York should examine whether the organization promoted interventions using deceptive language. But when I presented the issue to my boss,she barely said a word. I gave up when I couldn’t stand the awkwardness anymore.

A few months later, in February 2025, the office sent out a [press release](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-and-coalition-13-attorneys-general-issue-joint-statement) denouncing President Donald Trump’s [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/) opposing pediatric gender medicine. James’s statement referred to these chemical and surgical interventions as “lifesaving.” I knew this wasn’t true—even the ACLU had [acknowledged](https://www.city-journal.org/article/aclu-attorney-confesses-transgender-suicide-claim-is-a-myth) as much a few months earlier before the Supreme Court—so I emailed the press office and civil rights bureau chief to alert them to the falsehood. They never replied.

Despite growing evidence that the practice was unsafe, the attorney general continued to side with providers of pediatric gender medicine*.* Heramicus briefs could have persuaded judges to protect the practice. Her press releases contributed to a feeling, among Democrats, that this topic wasn’t up for debate.

During one meeting in April 2025, a co-worker slammed girls who oppose biological males in women’s sports as “anti-trans.” I’d always gotten along with him, so I hoped we could have a constructive conversation if I reached out privately.

But when I later swung by his office and shared how many boys had recently won state titles in girls’ sports, he accused me of being uncivil. He’s the one who threatened to call HR.

Two weeks later, the Office of General Counsel reached out to say my blog may be violating the office’s “outside activities” policy—whichthreatens discipline, including dismissal, for any employee who comments publicly on a subject related to office business without seeking permission 21 days in advance. Since we were a large, generalist law firm, the rule applied to just about everything an engaged citizen might want to speak about.

I knew that my speech was constitutionally protected.Government employees are entitled to speak freely outside work, particularly on matters of “public concern,” so long as the value of the speech outweighs any disruption to the office’s day-to-day functioning. The foundational Supreme Court case is *[Pickering v. Board of Education](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1967/510)* (1968), which found a teacher’s letter to the editor criticizing his district’s school board was protected speech.

Still, within a few weeks**,** I submitted a formal “outside activity request”—even though I thought the demand on me was inappropriate—asking for permission to post on my blog.

When the form asked if my activity constituted a public service, I wrote: “Many gay people are skeptical of the ‘LGBTQ’ movement, especially pediatric gender transition. But they lie low because the gender-critical viewpoint is stigmatized. I seem to be the only gay lawyer in New York speaking out, and one of about three gay lawyers nationwide.” (I’ve since met more). “It’s important for all viewpoints to be heard in this high-stakes public discourse.”

Weeks went by, and I received no response from my bosses. I continued posting on my blog.

Then, in June 2025, theFederal Trade Commission (FTC) invited me to speak at its workshop “The Dangers of ‘Gender-Affirming Care’ for Minors.” Again, I asked for permission, making clear I would be speaking in a personal capacity. But my bureau chief and deputy bureau chief denied the request in writing because the talk would address consumer fraud, the legal area in which we worked.I requested a meeting to try to change their mind.

“I’m a consumer fraud attorney alleging that pediatric gender medicine could be a consumer fraud,” I said. “Doesn’t anyone in this office care?”

A long silence followed. They said I could discuss the matter with the deputy attorney general in charge of our division. In an email exchange with him, I told him that he and his colleagues should watch the FTC event to understand the full story of pediatric gender medicine.

By now, the workshop was days away. I put the finishing touches on my remarks for the FTC and boarded a train to D.C.

A few weeks later, the general counsel and her deputy hauled me in for an interview to help them decide whether to discipline me, and whether to let me blog. They asked me to name every podcast I’d spoken on and every journalist I’d talked to, what I’d said to the journalists, and whether I thought I had been authorized to speak to the FTC.

Throughout the interrogation we kept going round in circles. They’d say I’d violated the “outside activities” policy. I’d explain why I thought the policy was unconstitutional.

I chose progressive lawyering as my career because I wanted to fight for vulnerable people. It’s ironic that my career on the left may be over because I did exactly that.

These attorneys struggled to explain why my public statements were problematic. It was as if they hadn’t even read what I’d written. When the general counsel finally identified, in a letter to me in August, an objectionable line in my blog, it was where I’d referenced the Supreme Court’s holding that banning pediatric gender medicine “is not discriminatory.” The general counsel wrote that it contradicted James’s legal position. Indeed.

In September, James’s ethics committee granted me permission to post on Substack but forbade me to “take public legal positions that conflict with those of the” office of the attorney general, among other strictures. The memo claimed that publicly disagreeing with James violated attorney ethics rules—a frivolous argument that I read as an attempt to bully me.

I was determined to keep speaking about pediatric gender medicine. So when the ethics chief suddenly emailed me earlier this month to forbid me from speaking on an X Space hosted by [Democrats for an Informed Approach to Gender](https://www.di-ag.org/), I did not follow his order. Then I wrote him a memo about some of the false claims the lawyers for the attorney general’s office had been making in court about pediatric gender medicine. He should investigate whether they had violated attorney ethics rules, I wrote.

It was a few days later that I was accused of engaging in “disruptive public speech.” But in reality, I didn’t disrupt anything. The Democratic elite’s zombie-like devotion to pediatric gender medicine is as obstinate as ever.

For 15 years I worked as a public interest lawyer in civil legal aid and Democrat-run government agencies. I chose progressive lawyering as my career because I wanted to fight for vulnerable people. It’s ironic that my career on the left may be over because I did exactly that.

As I consider my legal options, I can promise this much—Letitia James may have fired me but she hasn’t shut me up.
