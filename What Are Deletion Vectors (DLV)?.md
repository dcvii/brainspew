Deletion Vectors are a **soft‚Äëdelete** mechanism in Delta Lake that enables **Merge‚Äëon‚ÄëRead** (MoR) behavior, letting update/delete/merge operations mark row positions as removed without rewriting the underlying Parquet files. This contrasts with the older **Copy‚Äëon‚ÄëWrite** (CoW) model, where even a single deleted record triggers rewriting of entire files [YouTube +8 docs.delta.io +8 Medium +8](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-deletion-vectors.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Supported since Delta Lake 2.3 (read-only), full deletion vector support for DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE appeared in later versions: DELETE in 2.4, UPDATE/MERGE in Delta 3.x [Miles Cole +4 docs.delta.io +4 delta.io +4](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-deletion-vectors.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## ‚úÖ Why Use Deletion Vectors?

- **Faster small changes**: Only binary bitmap metadata is written, rather than rewriting large Parquet files.
- **Write efficiency**: Particularly efficient when changes affect sparse rows across many files [Medium +11 delta.io +11 Towards AI +11](https://delta.io/blog/2023-07-05-deletion-vectors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **ACID semantics preserved**: Readers still get the correct view by merging with DLV metadata at read time.

However:

- **Read-time overhead**: Filtering DLV metadata adds overhead during queries.
- **Maintenance needed**: Unapplied deletion markers build up until compaction or purge [Medium +6 japila-books +6 Towards AI +6](https://books.japila.pl/delta-lake-internals/deletion-vectors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How They Work Under the Hood

### Enabling

On Databricks, settings can also auto-enable deletion vectors for new tables [YouTube +8 Databricks Documentation +8 Data in Action +8](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/deletion-vectors?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Write-Time

When you delete rows (e.g. `DELETE WHERE`), Delta writes a **deletion vector file or log entry** ‚Äîa bitmap of row positions using RoaringBitmap‚Äîwithout touching Parquet data files [Databricks Documentation +8 delta.io +8 Medium +8](https://delta.io/blog/2023-07-05-deletion-vectors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Read-Time

Delta reads the base Parquet + DLV metadata, applying filters to hide soft-deleted rows during query execution.

### Physical Cleanup

To remove soft-deleted rows physically:

- Run `OPTIMIZE` to compact affected Parquet files.
- Or use `REORG TABLE ... APPLY (PURGE)` to force rewriting files with DLVs applied [Medium +8 docs.delta.io +8 Towards AI +8](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-deletion-vectors.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- Then `VACUUM` can remove old files beyond retention threshold.

## üìä Copy-on-Write vs Merge-on-Read with Deletion Vectors

| Feature | Copy‚Äëon‚ÄëWrite | Merge‚Äëon‚ÄëRead (Deletion Vectors) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Write/Delete cost | Rewrites entire files | Writes small metadata only |
| Read-time cost | Minimal | Additional filtering overhead |
| Best for frequent updates | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Best for read-heavy workloads | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs compaction) |
| Compaction required | Less often | Yes (OPTIMIZE/REORG) |

That heatmap in the image above illustrates how deletion vectors provide faster DELETE performance as file count and changes grow [Microsoft Learn +2 docs.delta.io +2 Databricks Documentation +2](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-deletion-vectors.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [Data in Action](https://www.datainaction.dev/en/post/databricks-deletion-vector-photon-predictive-io-comparing-performance?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [Medium +6 delta.io +6 delta.io +6](https://delta.io/blog/2023-07-05-deletion-vectors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [Towards AI +4 delta.io +4 Medium +4](https://delta.io/blog/2023-07-05-deletion-vectors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## üí° Best Practices for Data Engineers

1. **Enable on high-write tables** (Bronze/Silver layers) where DML is frequent [Data in Action +7 Reddit +7 delta.io +7](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFabric/comments/1gjvig1/blog_unlock_faster_writes_in_delta_lake_with/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
2. **Plan regular maintenance**: schedule `OPTIMIZE`, `REORG TABLE APPLY PURGE`, and `VACUUM`.
3. **Monitor read latency**: as DLV files accumulate, query performance may degrade.
4. **Be cautious with compatibility**: older clients or Delta sharing may not support DLV-enabled tables [Medium +5 Databricks Documentation +5 Microsoft Learn +5](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/deletion-vectors?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [Medium](https://ange-kouame.medium.com/delta-lake-deletion-vectors-a-complete-overview-bf1b2dd3a7c0?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/workspace-settings/deletion-vectors?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
5. **Enable workspace auto‚Äëenable** options on Databricks to enforce default usage for new tables [Databricks Documentation +2 Databricks Documentation +2 Microsoft Learn +2](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/workspace-settings/deletion-vectors?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
6. **Consider using Photon + Predictive I/O** for further acceleration of deletion/update workloads in Databricks Runtime 14.x+ [YouTube +7 Databricks Documentation +7 Microsoft Learn +7](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/workspace-settings/deletion-vectors?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## üßæ Summary

Deletion Vectors mark a big leap forward in efficient data mutation workflows within Delta Lake. They give you **low-latency deletes and updates** without immediate file rewrites, ideal for high-change tables‚Äîbut they need **thoughtful maintenance** to keep query performance sharp. Choose wisely: use them where writes dominate and compaction is part of your data ops routine.
