NEW YORK CITY — Michael Macko hasn’t been a New York City voter for about a decade. But if he were, he said, he probably would have voted for front-runner Zohran Mamdani. Then he saw the photo that Mamdani [posted of himself](https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1979353018589237717) grinning next to Siraj Wahhaj, the imam of a Brooklyn mosque with “historical ties to terrorism,” according to a New York City [federal court filing](https://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/pr/raza_et_al_letter.pdf).

“I was shocked,” said Macko, 61, about Mamdani’s photo on Friday. “If I were going to vote, he would’ve just lost my vote.”

To Macko, a fashion stylist living in northern New Jersey, this wasn’t just a political miscalculation by the democratic socialist. It was personal. Thirty-two years ago, Macko [dropped off his father](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1B5sdnZzy6/) for work at the World Trade Center only to never see him again. That afternoon, Islamist extremists [detonated a bomb](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/27/nyregion/blast-hits-trade-center-bomb-suspected-many-are-trapped-for-hours.html?searchResultPosition=2) in an underground garage, killing six people, including his father, [William J. Macko](https://voicescenter.org/living-memorial/victim/william-j-macko), then 48 and a supervisor for the Port Authority.

A few years later, after authorities foiled a separate “Day of Terror” plot to bomb New York landmarks, federal prosecutors filed a list of people who they said “may be alleged as co-conspirators” in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center attack. Among them was Wahhaj. He has never been charged with any crime related to the attack, but his name has repeatedly surfaced alongside those who were.

“How can this do anything other than infuriate me?” asked Macko, who keeps two items from his father in the top drawer of a dresser: a Mickey Mouse watch frozen at 12:18—the exact time the bomb exploded—and a ring, which Macko described as “bent from the impact of the blast.”

“It certainly changed my thoughts on him,” he said about the photo of Mamdani and Wahhaj. “When I saw him in the debate, he was very smart and even funny—but all of that changed when I saw that photo.”

Macko is one of four New Yorkers I spoke to whose lives were forever changed by the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. They used words like *saddening*, *insane*, and *dangerous* to describe Mamdani’s photo opp.

Since then, Mamdani has drawn condemnation from his opponents in the mayoral race, plus Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, who [called the kinship](https://youtu.be/fLOSrAxssx8?si=L-U4Japr9lTsXDnf&t=30) between Mamdani and Wahhaj “a shame.” Yet many supporters of Mamdani, elected to the New York State Assembly in 2020 and known for his anti-Israel activism, seem oblivious about the controversy. As he has risen in the polls, his political coalition, once derided by critics as “ [downwardly mobile elites](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/downwardly-mobile-elites-love-zohran-mamdani-37729120?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcg8QkJPFRXZ-fDi1qerd_FJBBGFUVoFMIFBI2MMe8ns3lQ_2pRf4nvIWPVZDA%3D&gaa_ts=68f80647&gaa_sig=10CwnccX4M8OtRDzpS_yPq9x05P942yZURBv8XasTJfvf2h10n1wf-B7wM-CGK3PsvsPSps1HLfzKHZJj4S0xQ%3D%3D) ” and fueled by “ [Gen Z’s misplaced doomerism](https://nypost.com/2025/07/10/us-news/zohran-mamdanis-feeding-off-gen-zs-misplaced-doomerism/),” is encroaching on territory long thought to fall behind former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Those groups include , [financiers](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/21/business/zohran-mamdani-voters.html), and even [Jewish New Yorkers](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/mamdani-poll-nyc-mayors-race-cuomo-sliwa/).

Survivors and family members of victims of the 1993 World Trade Center attack told me that they do not understand why a relationship that would have sunk most candidates in the past seems to have done little or no political damage to Mamdani. The imam previously [donated $1,000](https://www.nyccfb.info/FTMSearch/IndependentSpenders/Contributions?ec=2025&rt=ind&ir=Unity%20%26%20Justice%20Fund&indId=Z196) to a super political action committee backing Mamdani. The Mamdani campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Cory Cuneo, a retired NYPD lieutenant who responded to the World Trade Center attacks in 1993 and 2001, told me that when he saw the photo of Mamdani and Wahhaj plastered across the front page of the newspaper, he took the paper inside and said to his wife, “You’d better see this.”

“When I saw him in the debate, he was very smart and even funny—but all of that changed when I saw that photo.” —Michael Macko

Cuneo and his wife then called the local Republican Party headquarters on Staten Island, where they have lived since the late 1980s. “We were begging them. Sliwa’s got to get out of the race,” said Cuneo, 66, referring to Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder. “He doesn’t have a chance in hell.”

Even though Cuneo called Cuomo, who is running as an independent, “scum of the earth,” Cuneo said he will vote for the former governor in hopes of helping him beat Mamdani. This will be the first election in Cuneo’s lifetime in which he doesn’t vote Republican, he said. And if Mamdani wins next month, Cuneo and his wife might move to Florida.

“I’m just tired of the winters,” he said. “And the politics are better down there.”

Mitch Silber, the NYPD’s former head of intelligence analysis, told me that his “jaw dropped” when he heard about Mamdani’s visit to Masjid At-Taqwa, the mosque led by Wahhaj. Mamdani, 34, is “just being brazen,” said Silber, who now runs the Community Security Initiative, a service that helps monitor threats against thousands of Jewish institutions across New York City. “He thinks his lead is so insurmountable that he wants to put a flag in the ground and say, ‘Listen, I’m ideologically comfortable here with these people and history and this location.’ ”

Wahhaj’s supporters have dismissed news coverage of the event as “ [dangerous](https://x.com/CAIRNational/status/1979749341201137753) ” and “ [Islamophobic fearmongering](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17Pj62Nx1J/).” On Sunday, Mamdani, who is Muslim, said that the controversy was “because of the fact of my faith and because I’m on the precipice of [winning this election](https://nypost.com/2025/10/19/us-news/zohran-mamdani-silent-when-questioned-over-terror-linked-brooklyn-imam-siraj-wahhaj/).” He said that Wahhaj also met with previous mayors Michael Bloomberg and Bill de Blasio, and campaigned with current mayor Eric Adams. “The only time it became an issue of national attention was when I met with him,” Mamdani said.

In 2021, de Blasio, a progressive Democrat often compared to Mamdani, [appeared at the mosque](https://a860-gpp.nyc.gov/concern/nyc_government_publications/rj430649c?locale=en) to promote the city’s mental health services. In 2015, Adams, then the Brooklyn borough president, [posted a photo](https://x.com/BKBoroHall/status/672508962143641600) of himself with Wahhaj, the [recipient of an award](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Cornerstone-Award-2017/ajh7-4wqg/about_data) meant to celebrate long-standing [Brooklyn residents](https://brooklynreporter.com/2016/07/three-longtime-sunset-residents-receive/). In 2009, a Bloomberg aide suggested that [it was a mistake](https://nypost.com/2009/11/12/1993-wtc-plotter-in-mike-meet/) to have invited Wahhaj to join a group of Muslim leaders who met with the mayor. “If we were aware of his full background, it would have been done differently,” the aide [told reporters](https://archive.is/XNQ3S).

On February 26, 1993, Tim Lang, then 32, had just parked his car when a 1,200-pound car bomb tore through the World Trade Center’s underground garage, [sending shock waves](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/27/nyregion/blast-hits-trade-center-bomb-suspected-many-are-trapped-for-hours.html?searchResultPosition=2) all the way to Ellis Island. He crawled over debris, cinder blocks, and even a dead body in search of an exit. Realizing that he was trapped, Lang began to pray, with a line from Genesis on his mind: *Do not be afraid.* He asked God for “the courage to die.”

That is when Cory Cuneo, the NYPD lieutenant, spotted Lang’s boot. As Cuneo pulled him out of the rubble, Lang shouted: “There’s another guy! You’ve gotta go back and get the other guy!” That man was [Wilfredo Mercado](https://timeline.911memorial.org/timeline/10691/images/161/222), 37, a Peruvian immigrant, but he died that day. So did Monica Rodriguez Smith, 35, a secretary who was [seven months’ pregnant](https://timeline.911memorial.org/timeline/10691/images/163/178) and eating lunch in a nearby basement. It was her last day before maternity leave.

Lang survived. But he sometimes wonders if anyone even remembers what happened. “After 1993, I knew they would come back,” he told me.

“The enemy, as far as I’m concerned,” Tim Lang said, “is about to be elected mayor of New York.”

On September 11, 2001, he raced back into his office building in lower Manhattan after American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center to call his sister, who [worked as a trader](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/26/nyregion/world-trade-center-1993.html) in the building. She didn’t answer. Neither did his nephew, a construction company project manager who died in the collapse of the south tower.

“I realize many years have passed,” Lang told me from his current office across the Hudson River in New Jersey. “But you know—the enemy has not made peace with us.”

Then he drew a breath and paused for four seconds. “The enemy, as far as I’m concerned,” he said, “is about to be elected mayor of New York.”
