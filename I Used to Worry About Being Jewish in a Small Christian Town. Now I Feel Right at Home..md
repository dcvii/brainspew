A woman reading a book with a Star of David on it while resting comfortably surrounded a church.

Robert Neubecker

When I was 30 years old, my oldest child came home from his first day of kindergarten talking about Jesus. Our family was Jewish and this was public school in Boone, N.C., in 1984. The mixing of church and state struck me as inappropriate and possibly unconstitutional, and I wrote a newspaper column about the incident that hit a nerve with Jewish readers around the country.

I imagined years of stifled conflict before my three children all graduated from high school. But my husband was settling into his teaching career, and moving wasn’t an option, so I decided not to bring unwanted pressure on my children by complaining.

Forty-plus years later, I regularly attend the monthly town council meeting in our adopted hometown of Fries, in southwest Virginia, and my favorite part is the opening invocation. All seven council members and the mayor are devoted Christians, and they invariably begin by thanking “Our Heavenly Father” for allowing us to be together in such beautiful surroundings. It reminds me of the Jewish prayer in which we thank God for bringing us to this day.

Then the speaker asks for wisdom and compassion to guide the council members toward actions that benefit all residents of the town and move the community forward. What marvelous sentiments, so simply stated. After the concluding “In Jesus’ name we pray,” I join in saying “Amen.” Then the people’s business commences.

I love how the invocation sets a calm, cooperative, even loving tone at a time when too many civic gatherings in this country are torn by ill will, short tempers, sometimes violence. At the first council meeting after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel, our town prayer leader added, “And we pray for Israel,” and I was blinded in a mist of tears.

My road from resisting public expressions of religion to embracing them took many twists and turns. Along the way, I discovered and began to practice the day-by-day rituals of Judaism, which helped me understand the larger fabric that clothes all religions: faith.

My husband and I moved to Fries after a decade in Asheville, N.C., a hipster hub bursting with creative energy. But the more seriously I took Judaism, the less attractive the city became. People seemed so judgmental and intolerant (“Anyone who votes for Trump is trash”), so quick to hurl f-bombs and other offensive language (do we not speak and pray from the same mouth?), so pessimistic (will climate change really kill us all in a few years, or can we hope for innovation?). Then there was the light pollution, worsening crime, and, strange to say, a lot of black bears roaming the city streets.

In 2018, looking for a calmer life, we moved to the country, deep in Appalachia. The very air became music, the fields and forest a pageant of color and motion. Human life shrank to a dust mote.

As in the foxhole, there are no atheists in the country. In effect I’ve moved to a faith community, where church provides the foundation of social life. But the fact that I attend a synagogue instead doesn’t seem to matter. I get nothing but understanding when I explain to a repairman that he can’t work on Saturdays, because that’s my Sabbath.

It’s been easy—uplifting—to make friends. One acquaintance always answers the question “How are you?” with “Richly blessed and highly favored”—not “Everything sucks.” No one says “Goodbye”; it’s “Have a blessed day.” I enjoy having earnest conversations about religion with my new neighbors. We all learn something of value: humility, generosity and acceptance.

If Jesus gets the credit at the town council meeting, well, that’s the price of the ticket. And I’m happy to pay.
