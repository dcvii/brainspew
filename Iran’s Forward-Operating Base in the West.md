During its nearly 27 years of power, the Venezuelan regime of the late Hugo Chavez and then Nicolás Maduro has made their country a key ally of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Aligning Caracas’s policy to the theocracy’s radical global agenda has included letting Hezbollah operate freely in Venezuela. With Nicolas Maduro now incarcerated in New York, his regime’s survival uncertain, and the Caribbean nation’s future hanging in the balance, Iran and Hezbollah have much to lose from a major foreign-policy realignment in Caracas. For Iran and Hezbollah, Venezuela held high strategic value—it was a means of evading sanctions; a gateway to Latin America where terror plots could be hatched against the United States and Israel; an ideological fellow traveller that would join the battle against the West at the UN and in other international fora; a partner in illicit business activities; a base to spread Iran’s radical ideology; and a facilitator of Hezbollah’s drug-trafficking and money-laundering activities. Losing all this now will not be the end of Iran’s and Hezbollah’s adventurism in the region, but it would be a significant setback.

First, there is terrorism. The foremost state sponsor of terrorism and its proxies have found in Venezuela a friendly nation that lets Iran’s terror operatives go in and out of Latin America. Last November, the [*Daily Mail* reported](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15267157/Irans-Plot-assassinate-Israeli-Ambassador-Mexico.html?ref=quillette.com) an Iranian plot to assassinate Israel’s ambassador to Mexico. The plot was hatched in Caracas, probably at the home of an Iranian cleric who is the [permanent representative in Venezuela](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2025/12/analysis-irans-al-mustafa-university-is-a-terror-front.php?ref=quillette.com) for Al Mustafa International University. Al Mustafa is under sanctions from both [the United States](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1205?ref=quillette.com) and [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/10/canada-imposes-new-sanctions-against-iranian-regime.html?ref=quillette.com) but it is free to operate in Caracas. It is not just a multinational propaganda tool for Iran’s regime, but according to both US and Canadian designations, it also provides material support for terrorism. Its permanent campus in Caracas organises conferences and events, ongoing academic cooperation with local universities, and recruitment of local Venezuelans. The region has suffered three deadly terror attacks by Iran and Hezbollah while others have been thwarted by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Were Iran and its proxies to lose access to Venezuela, it would become a safer place.

Iran is able to exploit Venezuela as a forward-operating terrorist base because Iranian and Hezbollah terror operatives and terror financiers have ready access to the Caribbean nation. Some Iranian and Hezbollah agents have acquired Venezuelan passports, thanks to another perk enjoyed by Iran and its proxies as a result of their close ties to Caracas. In 2017, a Venezuelan whistleblower [revealed that](https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/world/venezuela-passports-investigation?ref=quillette.com) the Chavez/Maduro regime granted thousands of citizenships to Middle Eastern nationals. A list that I obtained from Venezuelan opposition figures puts that number at over 10,000 and local embassies, for the most part, managed the sale of passports in the region. Access to coveted Latin American passports has made it easier for Iranian and Hezbollah agents to enter and exit the region, making Venezuela Iran’s visa-free gateway to Latin America.

Among those who hold a Venezuelan passport are the Lebanese brothers Amer and Samer Akil Rada. Amer was implicated in the 1994 terror attack on the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA), a Jewish cultural centre in Buenos Aires. Eighty-five innocents were murdered and hundreds more were wounded in that atrocity. He remained responsible for Hezbollah operations in the region for over a decade after that and he is still a member of Hezbollah’s External Security Organisation (ESO), the branch of the organisation in charge of military and terror operations. Amer [was recently sanctioned](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1726?ref=quillette.com) —along with his younger brother Samer and his son Mehdi Akil Helbawi—for running an illicit fundraising scheme for Hezbollah. Samer was previously [implicated in cocaine trafficking](https://www.kharon.com/brief/u-s-sanctions-hizballah-financial-network-in-latin-america?ref=quillette.com) and remains in Venezuela, where he runs a thriving crypto business. This case, perhaps more than any other, shows the confluence of terror and illicit crime propped up by the sponsorship and protection provided by state sovereignty. It is by no means the only example.

Other agents of Iran and its proxies have earned Venezuelan nationality through Chavez’s and Maduro’s generosity, such as Fawzi Mustapha Kenaan, [sanctioned in 2008](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp1036?ref=quillette.com) by the US for transferring funds to Hezbollah, plotting terrorist attacks and kidnappings, and travelling to Iran with other Hezbollah members for training. His business partner was Ghazi Atef Nassereddine ([also sanctioned](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp1036?ref=quillette.com)), an influential leader of the local Lebanese community. In 2006, Nassereddine was in charge of Venezuela’s embassy in Syria, where he facilitated donations to Hezbollah, coordinated meetings with its officials, and organised their visits to Venezuela. Another Venezuelan passport holder is [US-sanctioned](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0278?ref=quillette.com) [Jihad Muhammad Qansu](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=23663&ref=quillette.com), a senior Hezbollah financial official within the organisation’s Business Affairs Component, a loose network of Lebanese expatriates, coordinated by Hezbollah’s ESO, to raise funds for the terror group. These include Ali and Abbas Hussein Harb, alongside Ali and Kassem Mohamad Salameh, all of whom are associated with a major Hezbollah [money-laundering and drug-trafficking scheme](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/tg1624?ref=quillette.com) that US authorities exposed in 2011. They were all Venezuelan-passport or permanent-residency holders.

The list of Lebanese nationals with Venezuelan passports that I obtained from the Venezuelan opposition also includes many others who, while not directly identified as Hezbollah, have family or business links to Hezbollah and international commercial activities. Hassan Ayoub Menhem, for instance, is a Lebanese businessman whose nephew is a Hezbollah member; Abdel Majid Hussein is a business partner of the Syrian-Lebanese dual national and [US-sanctioned](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1369?ref=quillette.com) “king of Captagon” Hassan Mohamad Daqqou; and Adel Mohamad Ali Safieddine is a business associate of [US-sanctioned](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0796?ref=quillette.com) Hezbollah terror financier Ahmad Jalal Reda Abdallah. Their access to Venezuela’s economy and territory, granted by Chavez and Maduro years ago, made Hezbollah’s financial operations in the region easier to organise.

First Chavez and then Maduro also enabled Iran’s propaganda machine to spread Iran’s ideology across the region from Caracas. With Iranian support, an academic department in one of the capital’s universities was established in November 2020 and [named after the late Qassem Soleimani](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/soleimani-u?ref=quillette.com), the Pasdaran arch-terrorist and butcher of Aleppo, whom US President Donald Trump eliminated in Baghdad on 3 January 2020 (six years to the day before US forces captured Nicolas Maduro in Caracas). Iranian penetration into Venezuela’s academic institutions goes hand in hand with the establishment of mosques and cultural centres across the country and the broadcasting of a 24/7 propaganda channel—Hispan TV—that Iran’s former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad inaugurated in 2012 during a state visit to Caracas.

Between propaganda programs and terror plotting, Iran’s presence and influence is ubiquitous. A factory [manufactures Iranian drones](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202509044107?ref=quillette.com) under Venezuelan licence, Iranian know-how is used to [restore Venezuelan oil-refining capacity](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202311062796?ref=quillette.com) and output, [and a long-haul fleet of aircraft](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4472343-how-the-us-can-ground-irans-terrorist-airlines/?ref=quillette.com) purchased from Iran is operated by Venezuela’s Conviasa. All of this is evidence of Venezuela’s deepening economic, political, and military dependence on Tehran. Becoming a saviour to Venezuela’s beleaguered oil sector gave Iran enormous leverage, alongside the other rapacious authoritarians who descended on Venezuela’s fabled natural resources like vultures. With Maduro gone, and a possible democratic transition looming, all that hangs by a thread now.

That relationship was not always tilted in Iran’s favour; there was a time when a still somewhat functioning Venezuelan regime could help Iran evade international banking and commercial sanctions. But those days are gone and Venezuela now owes Iran US$2 billion, which Tehran may no longer be able to collect. During the past five years, the Iranian regime rescued Maduro’s crumbling oil sector [with a dramatic airlift](https://thedispatch.com/article/iran-is-airlifting-supplies-to-venezuela/?ref=quillette.com) in the Spring of 2020. Since then, Caracas has been paying Tehran by providing precious gold at a discounted price in exchange for Iranian gasoline, technical assistance to repair its crumbling energy sector, weapons, and other critical support.

Much of what Tehran and Caracas do together is easy to track—the propaganda synergy of their TV channels (Iran’s HispanTV and Maduro’s TeleSur); Venezuela’s diplomatic alignment with Iran’s Axis of Resistance, including mutually supportive UN votes and diplomatic events; support for antagonist NGOs through conferences and funding; and the military contracts, state visits, and military sales. Hezbollah’s footprint in the country is harder to detect, but no less important. Since Chavez’s time, Venezuela’s brand of Latin American left-wing populism has gradually gutted the country’s economy and turned state institutions into an organised-crime syndicate with the trappings of sovereignty. Terrorist groups on the lawless Colombian-Venezuelan border, like the Colombian FARC and ELN, control the flow of narcotics, and Venezuelan authorities facilitate transit through their territory.

Hezbollah’s financial networks, for their part, play the traditional role of terror-crime intermediary, facilitating logistics, transport, and financial services for illicit business, much of which is a three-way street: the criminal gangs produce and sell, the regime extracts fees, and Hezbollah facilitates global distribution and repatriation of proceeds. Its nefarious role as crime enabler is not limited to drugs; its members are also engaged as middlemen in the thriving trade of illegally extracted gold, a veritable environmental and human disaster unfolding in the Orinoco Basin under the Venezuelan regime’s watchful eye.

Traditionally, Hezbollah’s regional representative has been sitting in São Paulo in Brazil, not in Caracas. But the last appointed Hezbollah “ambassador” left Brazil in 2019, nine years after [he was sanctioned by the US Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/tg997?ref=quillette.com). The tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay is another key hub for Hezbollah’s illicit finance. Regardless, Venezuela is a critical node in Hezbollah’s Latin America networks, especially because, unlike any other country in the region, it is a safe haven for their operatives.

In part, this arises from the convergence between a narcostate, on one hand, wedded to greed and third-worldist ideology, and a terror state (and its proxy), on the other, embracing much the same, albeit from a Shia Islamist perspective. Still, Venezuela might not have turned so quickly into Hezbollah’s Caribbean colony had it not been for the robust presence of a thriving Syro-Lebanese diaspora. Some of its members have become deeply embedded in the Castro-Chavista power structure, such as Ghazi Atef Nassereddine, former vice-president Tareck Al Aissami (since fallen out of grace), and Adel El Zabayar, a former member of Venezuela’s parliament whom the US Department of Justice [indicted in 2020](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-member-venezuelan-national-assembly-charged-narco-terrorism-drug-trafficking-and?ref=quillette.com) as a key figure in the regime’s Cartel de los Soles, the mafia drug-trafficking ring within the Maduro cupola.

Both Hezbollah and Iran have some cards left to play in Latin America. The deck is shrinking, however, and if their time in Caracas is up, their regional operation could soon also fold under US pressure.
