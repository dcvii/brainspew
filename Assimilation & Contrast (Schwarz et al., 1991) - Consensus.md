Schwarz, Strack, and Mai (1991) explain when earlier questions in a survey make later judgments **more similar** (assimilation) or **more different** (contrast). Their central move is to treat the survey interview as a **conversation**, governed by norms like relevance and non‑redundancy, not just as isolated cognitive tasks.

## Core Idea: Conversational Logic of Part–Whole Sequences

In part–whole sequences (e.g., “marital satisfaction” then “life satisfaction”), a prior **specific** question can change how people answer a later **general** question [1](https://consensus.app/papers/assimilation-and-contrast-effects-in-partwhole-question-schwarz-strack/fca7aa8714a65213bd3379e2ab59b776/)[3](https://consensus.app/papers/context-effects-in-attitude-surveys-applying-cognitive-schwarz-strack/93fe884df7115186b79c32339dd8b5b9/)[14](https://consensus.app/papers/judgment-in-a-social-context-biases-shortcomings-and-the-schwarz/f4300d614ab053a19101ac73bcb9518d/)[15](https://consensus.app/papers/semantic-and-pragmatic-aspects-of-context-effects-in-strack-schwarz/4c92c6a3c900527bad10bfd3b63701ee/):

- If respondents treat questions as belonging to **different conversational contexts**, information activated by the specific question is reused for the general one → **assimilation** (general judgment shifts toward the specific).
- If they treat them as part of **one conversation**, norms of non‑redundancy lead them to avoid repeating what they already “gave” and to focus on other aspects → **contrast**, under specified conditions [1](https://consensus.app/papers/assimilation-and-contrast-effects-in-partwhole-question-schwarz-strack/fca7aa8714a65213bd3379e2ab59b776/)[3](https://consensus.app/papers/context-effects-in-attitude-surveys-applying-cognitive-schwarz-strack/93fe884df7115186b79c32339dd8b5b9/)[14](https://consensus.app/papers/judgment-in-a-social-context-biases-shortcomings-and-the-schwarz/f4300d614ab053a19101ac73bcb9518d/).

## When Assimilation vs. Contrast Emerges

These dynamics help reconcile previously contradictory findings in survey context effects and feed into later inclusion/exclusion models of social judgment [2](https://consensus.app/papers/mental-construal-and-the-emergence-of-assimilation-and-bless-schwarz/4e47220b6a8b5159b4b298ce54e929c1/)[4](https://consensus.app/papers/scandals-and-the-publics-trust-in-politicians-schwarz-bles/68a0fafc8c10557b94b04bcffef73253/)[5](https://consensus.app/papers/constructing-reality-and-its-alternatives-an-inclusion-schwarz-bless/281a498b97125ce9a207aa3a67d112be/)[6](https://consensus.app/papers/context-effects-in-political-judgement-assimilation-and-bless-schwarz/6034a4150648539f96ed707ba65f9f36/)[13](https://consensus.app/papers/agenda-2000-%E2%80%94-social-judgment-and-attitudes-warmer-more-schwarz/59135a49484b51f797580c48cd33f1a0/).

## Broader Implications

The 1991 model underpins a larger program showing that attitude reports are **constructed in context**, not merely retrieved, and that small design choices (question order, grouping, labeling) can systematically bias measured attitudes [3](https://consensus.app/papers/context-effects-in-attitude-surveys-applying-cognitive-schwarz-strack/93fe884df7115186b79c32339dd8b5b9/)[8](https://consensus.app/papers/context-effects-in-social-and-psychological-research-schwarz-sudman/2461a41b2df65447afe9d2ccb4986c0b/)[9](https://consensus.app/papers/selfreports-of-behaviours-and-opinions-schwarz/bee91664112a56dead6f0ef091f6cbec/)[14](https://consensus.app/papers/judgment-in-a-social-context-biases-shortcomings-and-the-schwarz/f4300d614ab053a19101ac73bcb9518d/).

## Summary

Schwarz et al. (1991) show that whether prior questions produce assimilation or contrast depends on how respondents interpret the **conversational relationship** between specific and general questions. Multiple related specifics usually yield assimilation (summary use), while a single specific can yield contrast when respondents infer the general question must cover “something else.” This conversational logic has become foundational for understanding and designing attitude surveys.
