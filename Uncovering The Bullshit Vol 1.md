For months, online networks have tracked ICE agents in real time — logging license plates, tagging vehicles, sharing intel in private chats. Now, leaked documents reveal how the system actually works, who built it, and who's funding it. All of the following information has been forwarded to the

BACKGROUND

In the wake of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, particularly Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota, which has led to thousands of arrests since December 2025, a decentralized network of anti-ICE activists has mobilized across the state, with signs of similar tactics spreading nationally. Operating primarily through encrypted Signal channels (often neighborhood-specific "rapid response" groups with dispatchers, patrols, and relay admins), the network maintains multiple public-facing identities to coordinate observations, alerts, and responses. These include:

- Isles RR (Isles Rapid Response) — A key Signal-based group focused on real-time plate checks, vehicle tailing, and alerts in Minneapolis neighborhoods like Isles/Uptown areas.
- MN Community Response (or Minnesota Community Response) — An umbrella term for county-level Signal networks, rapid deployment teams, and shared resources like databases and patrol manuals, emphasizing "community networks" in every Minnesota county.
- Whipple Watch — An informal monitoring action centered on the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building (Fort Snelling ICE facility in St. Paul), where volunteers track convoys, agents, and releases, often feeding intel into broader chats.

These labels function more as project tags or chat group names than formal organizations. No single headquarters, no public 501(c)(3) filings, just loose coalitions of volunteers using tools like Airtable for suspected ICE vehicle databases, Proton Drive for shared "Patrol Manuals," and emoji-coded alerts to mobilize quickly. Publicly, the networks frame their work as lawful: legal observation of federal agents, peaceful protest, community outreach, and "know your rights" support. They position themselves as modern neighborhood watches defending vulnerable residents from what they call excessive enforcement. But documents, chat logs, and on-the-ground tactics raise serious questions: Are these activities truly limited to passive observation? Or do they cross into real-time interference, obstruction, or worse? The timing is anything but coincidental. The surge in enforcement has sparked intense backlash, culminating in two high-profile fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis this month alone:

- On January 7, 2026, ICE agent Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Nicole Good (also reported as Renée Macklin Good), a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, mother of three, poet, and local resident. Multiple bystander videos and an ICE agent's own cellphone footage show the encounter unfolding after Good stopped near an enforcement action, possibly to witness or support neighbors. Her death was ruled a homicide, and it has galvanized outrage, with memorials, chants like "Observing ICE is not a crime," and scrutiny over ICE tactics.
- Less than three weeks later, on January 24th, federal agents (including Border Patrol) shot and killed Alex Pretti (Alex Jeffrey Pretti), a 37-year-old ICU nurse at a VA hospital. This second event intensified protests, with thousands marching in subzero temperatures, and even drew bipartisan criticism and calls for deeper probes into ICE/DHS conduct.

Were Good and Pretti truly "innocent bystanders" caught in the crossfire? Or were they drawn to the scenes, perhaps via rapid response alerts, to observe, document, or impede ICE operations, only for encounters to turn deadly? The networks' playbook of real-time tracking, tailing vehicles, and mobilizing crowds could explain how civilians end up in such volatile situations so quickly.

Watching this unfold, led me to ask these questions:

Who orchestrates this?

Who funds the tools, trainings, and coordination?

And with federal scrutiny mounting, including potential FBI probes into Signal chats for obstruction, what comes next?

The documents and evidence uncovered in this investigation may force answers and challenge the narrative that these are merely peaceful observers. What follows will make you question everything you've been told about these "community networks" and the true cost of resistance.

## 

THE SOFTWARE/INFRASTRUCTURE

By now, we've all seen fragments of the chaos; leaked signal screenshots from groups like Ward 4 N MPLS RR Alerts and Southside RR Daily flooding x, showing real-time plate checks, emoji alert systems, dispatchers summoning crowds, and panicked admins scrambling as infiltrations into their signal chats were exposed. Those leaks, many tied to journalists like

[@camhigby](https://x.com/@camhigby)

, cracked open the facade of "peaceful observation", revealing coordinated tracking, tailing, and mobilization that critics call outright obstruction.

What i am about to show you has yet to be seen by anyone outside a tight inner circle.

All of this is made possible by a whistleblower with genuine inside access: not just chat logs, but never-before-exposed organizational documents, databases logging thousands of suspected government vehicles, and proprietary software tools used for rapid verification and deployment. These materials go far beyond surface-level screenshots. They expose the infrastructure, funding trails, the hierarchies, and the decision-making that turned neighborhood "response" networks into something far more systematic and potentially criminal.

Introducing "Community of Service":

As you can see, this is now far more sophisticated than a typical signal chat. Available to only vetted and verified "patrollers". Patrollers can now pick up shifts, view available routes, view live maps and much more.

Additionally, within the "Routes & Locations" page, are marked known ICE housing locations.

Patrollers can register a "patrol vehicle". And even request to be a "Dispatcher"

Why is this special?

Seeing these screenshots, you might be thinking: “Okay, so they built a website and slapped a password on it, what’s the big deal?”

The real discovery isn’t what’s visible on the surface. It’s what the backend data reveals.

Who’s actually behind this operation?

Who are the dispatchers?

Who’s providing the funding?

I can’t say with absolute certainty based solely on the data I’ve seen, but the patterns and connections paint a very clear picture.

## 

The Data

The information that you are about to read contains the names of individuals potentially involved. All of this has and will continue to be handed over to the FBI. Here is what has been given to me by the whistleblower.

Disclaimer: The individuals referenced in this data are not confirmed to be involved in any wrongdoing; the information presented reflects only what the raw data appears to show and should not be interpreted as conclusive evidence of involvement.

Users sign up with their real name to become vetted, and then link their signal name to the site

This first screenshot shows all active "Dispatchers". Some very interesting names on this list. More on that later.

Based on the .JSON file data, here are the top dispatchers for the new site.

In the data, there is a "Major Incident" practice mode. What are they planning for?

Overnight there was a bulk import of 96 vehicles. This data is coming from two different tables; "Source":"Airtable". Which potentially means they are working together with other groups to combine data. Data is current as of 1/27/2026.

Two different sources:

Airtable - 4,143 (87%)

local - 608 (13%)

Vehicle statuses:

Validated: 2,650

Suspected: 1,473

Unconfirmed: 628

What does this data mean? 2,650 vehicles have been "validated" as ICE. 1,473 vehicles has been marked "suspected" as ICE. And 628 unconfirmed.

This information along with all the plate numbers has been sent over to the FBI.

The End

In conclusion, the shadowy figures embedded in the 'Community of Service' Network point to vast webs of influence, complete with covert links to underground immigrant rights groups and anti-ICE campaigns that shatter the official story.

This isn't confined to one state. it's nationwide. Keep an eye out for Volume 2, where we dive even deeper to uncover buried ties and silenced truths from this mysterious network.

As always, do your own digging to confirm. If you think its bad, it gets worse. Thanks for following along. Your involvement is key to unraveling these hidden societal threads.
