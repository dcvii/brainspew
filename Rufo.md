From his perch outside Seattle, the 40-year-old documentary filmmaker and writer has become one of the country’s most influential—and effective—culture warriors, waging public fights against [diversity, equity and inclusion](https://www.wsj.com/business/diversity-goals-are-disappearing-from-companies-annual-reports-459d1ef3?mod=article_inline) efforts in schools, businesses and government. 

Rufo [exposed plagiarism](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-continues-to-back-its-president-claudine-gay-after-new-plagiarism-allegations-ae494ca7?mod=article_inline) in the academic scholarship of Harvard President Claudine Gay and in the writings of Democratic presidential candidate [Kamala Harris](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/kamala-harris). His reports played a role in Gay’s [subsequent resignation](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/conservatives-toppled-two-college-presidents-theyre-not-done-yet-18e87c4a?mod=article_inline) in January of this year and damaged Harris’s campaign. He has also taken aim at diversity practices in large companies, most recently at [Boeing](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA). 

A father of four who relishes throwing rhetorical grenades at the progressive left, he said he isn’t pursuing a role in the Trump administration but wants to help shape its agenda.

[JD Vance](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/jd-vance), among many others in the new Trump administration, is listening. 

Vance views Rufo as “a leading voice in the movement to restore merit and excellence” to universities, a spokeswoman said, adding that the vice president-elect believes Rufo “recognizes schools and universities exist to equip American students to face tomorrow’s challenges, not to indoctrinate them with the fringe beliefs of the far left.” 

Rufo said he is meeting with members of the Trump administration next month. He has said he thinks colleges and universities have been taken over by the left, and he wants to recapture them by cutting federal money to schools that continue to engage in DEI practices. He also wants to excise race-based affirmative action from any institution with which the federal government does business.

He has a particular animus toward elite universities, which he says traded merit and rigor for neo-Marxism and discrimination against white and Asian people. 

“It’s time to really put the hammer to these institutions and to start withdrawing potentially billions of dollars in funding until they follow the law,” he said.

Universities have said they are legally and ethically responding to the changing demographics of the nation and can no longer offer a great education if their campuses are organized around only white men.

### Who is Rufo?

Rufo grew up in a politically moderate home in Sacramento, Calif. He pins his political awakening on the five years he spent filming “America Lost,” about struggling postindustrial cities such as Youngstown, Ohio. 

He said he came to believe that antipoverty programs such as welfare were destroying families and undermining community organizations. He said he began the film as a libertarian but finished as a conservative.

In 2018, Rufo was living in Seattle and ran for city council on a campaign promise to crack down on homelessness. 

“The political leaders were unwilling to draw a line and say, ‘Hey, these are the rules,’” said Rufo. “‘If you go outside of those, there will be consequences.’”

He withdrew from the race citing death threats, but his misgivings about the country were growing. He wrote a series of articles for conservative think tanks about what he viewed as progressivism run amok. That work led to a tip about a training program for Seattle city employees called “Interrupting Internalized Racial Superiority and Whiteness.”

Rufo traced the ideas behind the training workshop back to [critical race theory](https://www.wsj.com/articles/critical-race-theory-what-it-means-for-america-and-why-it-has-sparked-debate-11623956268?mod=article_inline), a concept developed by legal scholars in the 1970s. The theory holds that racism is embedded in American laws and institutions, and not only a result of individual bias.

Rufo’s writing from his well-read newsletter and his perch at conservative think tanks including the Manhattan Institute, as well as his appearances on cable news, helped define CRT in the public imagination. He cast it as a villain fueling the Black Lives Matter protests and the extended pandemic school closures. 

In 2020, Tucker Carlson invited him on his Fox News show, where Rufo ended a four-minute riff about CRT with a brash appeal to Trump to ban it from the federal government. 

The next morning at 7 a.m., Rufo said, his phone rang with a Washington, D.C., number. Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows was on the line. He asked Rufo to come to the White House to help design a plan to abolish CRT, Rufo said. Meadows didn’t return a call for comment.

A few weeks later Trump signed the executive order.

### What happens now?

In Trump’s second term Rufo sees an opportunity to finally excise the ideology that has animated his campaigns. His stated goal: make America a colorblind society by eliminating rules that mandate behavior or special treatment according to race.

Rufo said he has succeeded in demonizing CRT and DEI in the public’s mind. Now he wants to uproot what he sees as an administrative state that keeps the policies in place across universities, government and businesses. Rufo, along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, says Trump should reverse President Lyndon Johnson’s executive order establishing affirmative action in the federal government.

The American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations say Rufo’s work promotes denial about racism and contend that the wider Republican push against DEI practices undermines racial equity and stifles free speech.

Rufo dismisses that characterization and says current diversity practices justify discrimination and devalue individual merit.

“An organization can prioritize excellence or diversity, but not both simultaneously,” he said.

Rufo supports closing the Education Department and forcing schools to advertise the earnings of graduates from specific programs so students understand their risks when they enroll. If students default on their loans, he says universities should have responsibility for paying some of it back.

Ultimately, Rufo would like to see the number of Americans who enroll in four-year colleges slashed by more than half.

He hasn’t met Linda McMahon, Trump’s nominee [to lead the Education Department](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-to-nominate-linda-mcmahon-to-lead-education-department-33e3e095?mod=article_inline), but the secretary pick leads the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank that has featured Rufo’s work prominently. 

Rufo’s tactics rile people who say that he is more interested in spectacle—and making good video—than substance. A former professor at New College of Florida, a once progressive public liberal-arts college where Rufo is a trustee, described him arriving on campus with a film crew in tow.  

“He was there to create a narrative,” said Aaron Hillegass, the professor. “His team filmed everything and released clips that made him seem professional and everyone else seem a little unhinged.”

The first time then-President [Donald Trump](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/donald-trump) asked Christopher Rufo to come to Washington for a meeting with his team, the result was a [2020 executive order](https://www.wsj.com/articles/conservative-activist-grabbed-trumps-eye-on-diversity-training-11602242287?mod=article_inline) banning race or sex stereotyping in the federal government. 

Now Rufo has an invitation to Mar-a-Lago, where he will present the president-elect’s team with a plan to geld American universities by withholding money if they don’t pull back on diversity measures. It is the latest chapter in Rufo’s quest to end activities that he says divide Americans and foster bias against different groups, including white men.
