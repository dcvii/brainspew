1. **It ain’t as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.** Leaving the office at night with a winning attitude affects more than you alone; it also conveys that attitude to your followers.
2. **Get mad, then get over it.** Everyone gets mad. It’s a natural and healthy emotion. My experience is that staying mad isn’t useful.
3. **Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.** Accept that your position was faulty, not your ego.
4. **It can be done.** Have a positive and enthusiastic approach to every task. Don’t surround yourself with instant skeptics.
5. **Be careful what you choose: You may get it.** You will have to live with your choices. Some bad choices can be corrected. Some you’ll be stuck with.
6. **Don’t let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.** Superior leadership is often a matter of superb instinct. When faced with a tough decision, use the time available to gather information that will inform your instinct.
7. **You can’t make someone else’s choices. You shouldn’t let someone else make yours.** Make sure the choice is yours and you are not responding to the pressure and desire of others.
8. **Check small things**. Leaders have to have a feel for small things — a feel for what is going on in the depths of an organization where small things reside.
9. **Share credit**. People need recognition and a sense of worth as much as they need food and water.
10. **Remain calm. Be kind.** Few people make sound or sustainable decisions in an atmosphere of chaos.
11. **Have a vision. Be demanding.** Followers need to know where their leaders are taking them and for what purpose. Good leaders set vision, mission, and goals.
12. **Don’t take counsel of your fears or naysayers.** Those who do risk wasting their time and energy.
13. **Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.** If you believe in the likelihood of success, your followers will too.
