Seattle police use crowd control weapons to disperse protesters on Capitol Hill in July. A judge has found SPD in contempt of court for indiscriminate use of some devices during Black Lives Matter protests. (Amanda Snyder / The Seattle Times)

A federal judge [finds the Police Department in contempt of court](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/federal-judge-holds-spd-in-contempt-for-use-of-pepper-spray-blast-balls-during-black-lives-matter-protests-this-fall/) for the indiscriminate use of pepper-filled blast balls and pepper spray during demonstrations. There were many instances, however, where he said he couldn’t be sure of the propriety of officers’ use of force because of the chaotic nature of the events and unclear video from police body cameras and protesters’ cameras and phones.
