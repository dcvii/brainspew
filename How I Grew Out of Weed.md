I started smoking weed when I was a junior in high school, right after I got my driver’s license. Before long, I was smoking every week. At the beginning of my senior year, a friend introduced me to Xanax, which I began taking occasionally. After catching me in multiple lies about where I was and what I’d been doing and finding several prescription pills in my jacket pocket, my parents gave me a series of stern talks, telling me to shape up. My dad had said that if he caught me doing drugs, he would send me to boarding school. But with little more than a year before high school graduation, he thought it unwise to disrupt my education.

I thought I was off the hook, so I didn’t stop. I was getting high almost every day. But in June, after graduation, I received an email from my parents telling me it was time to move out. They said they were available to talk about finding somewhere to live, and they were open to helping me financially. But the deadline was not negotiable: two months.

I didn’t respond. I was upset to be kicked out of my childhood home, but I wrote in my diary at the time, “There is so much drama that I figure it would be stupid to fight to live there.” Deep down, I knew I’d been unpleasant to live with.

So I left. My parents and I hugged goodbye on the way out. I knew my fate was mild compared to one particularly drug-addled friend of mine. He was one of a handful of kids at my high school whose parents hired private security to kidnap their children in the middle of the night and take them to “wilderness camp,” a militaristic rehabilitation program in Utah. He came back months later with a buzz cut and the phone number of a new dealer.

This was back in 2017, in California, which had voted on Election Day the year before to legalize marijuana. In the years since, other states have followed suit, [marijuana has gotten](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/marijuana-induced-psychiatric-disorders-high-potency-weed-psychosis-rcna146072) more potent, and [stories](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2021/10/17/marijuana-colorado-damage-children-brain-development-addiction/8469449002/) about kids’ lives being derailed by weed have followed. In 2025, [5.6 percent](http://drugabusestatistics.org/marijuana-addiction/) of twelfth graders used marijuana every day, according to the federal government. Disturbing [evidence has piled up](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/29/nx-s1-5589224/teens-weed-cannabis-marijuana) to suggest that using weed as a teenager can increase the risk of addiction later in life, stunt cognitive development, and cause anything from psychotic episodes to personality changes. Despite all this, the government [moved in December to reclassify](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/trump-cannabis-executive-order) the drug as less dangerous. Whether that was a good or bad idea will no doubt be a subject of debate in the coming years, but in the meantime, parents across America are just as anxious as mine were about their kids’ marijuana use. Their question is urgent: How do we help our children right now?

What are you supposed to do when your son disengages with society? When your daughter gives up on life? Some parents enable their stoner offspring—the cool moms and dads who let their kids have friends over to smoke in the backyard. As a teenager, I regarded these parents with cautious fascination, awed that they let me do what I wanted. Other parents may not like that their kid does drugs but they can’t fight the instinct to protect him, so they let him keep living in the basement as he transitions from child to man, smoking joints instead of looking for a job. And then there are the parents like mine, the parents who kick their kids out.

On my best days, I am grateful for what they did. Occasionally, I hear stories about old friends, now in their late 20s, living at home or drifting from place to place, having never participated in life. That’s not what happened to me—and I credit my parents, because they were the ones who told me that enough was enough. It didn’t immediately fix me. But it forced me to stand on my own two feet.

I was 13 when my family moved from central Pennsylvania to Palo Alto, California. I loved the palm trees and the weather, and my public high school looked like a movie set. But the stereotype was true: Drug use was rampant at California high schools. It was only a matter of time.

There’s an embarrassing video of me smoking weed for the first time—holding a bong, wearing a gray quarter-zip sweater, my car keys on a lanyard looped around my neck, displayed proudly like an Olympic medalist. I cough, and ask my friend behind the camera if I did it right.

I was around 16 then, still a strong student. My high school is known for being extremely competitive. I remember one girl making a spreadsheet to calculate her chances at each school in the Ivy League. At the beginning of senior year, I started to crack. I wanted to forget about the rat race, so I gravitated toward new friends who were less interested in school and more interested in collecting expensive bongs. I smoked because I was stressed about applying to college. I took Xanax to get high, but also because it tamed my anxiety. I took Prozac, too, which I was prescribed for depression. My teachers could tell when I came to class high.

“For someone who wants to go to a good college, you’re acting like someone who should be at community college,” one of my teachers told me during senior year.

“I realized that I was choosing misery. People were praying for me. They wanted the best for me. I had to want it for myself, too.” (Daniel Paik for *The Free Press*)

I wanted so badly to leave Palo Alto and go to college, and yet I repeatedly procrastinated filling out my applications, asking for letters of recommendation, and meeting with the school counselor. In the last month of my senior year, two final rejections landed in my application portal. I graduated from high school dejected, looking out over a sea of caps adorned with college logos. My car, my clothes, and my bedroom smelled like weed.

Two weeks later, I got the eviction email from my parents. I had two months to figure out where I was going to live and how I was going to make enough to support myself. I didn’t want their help. I got a job working part-time at a smoothie shop, making 12 bucks an hour. Sam, my best friend at the time, was about to leave for the East Coast to play soccer at a liberal arts college. He spoke to his parents, told them what was going on, and they offered to let me live at their house for a few weeks.

I was foolish, but I wasn’t stupid. I recognized that the drugs weren’t good for me. “Don’t smoke weed,” I wrote to myself in my diary around this time. “Unless you’re really fucking depressed don’t smoke weed please.” But that still wasn’t enough to stop me.

Sam’s parents were good people. His father organized pickup soccer in the town fields for anyone and everyone who wanted to join, from Mexican day laborers to Silicon Valley tech workers. His mother worked with special-needs kids at a nearby elementary school. My hometown was known for two clusters of teen suicides. Between 2009 and 2011, nine current or former Palo Alto students killed themselves. Between 2014 and 2017, seven more, including a friend of mine and an acquaintance from my Boy Scouts troop. At some point in the earlier spate, Sam’s mom brought a lawn chair to the train crossings where kids were known to commit suicide. She stayed up all night to watch the tracks, multiple nights a week. Her overnight watch eventually developed into an organized group of over 100 volunteers. Sometimes a lone figure would approach in the middle of the night, see the sentry, and then disappear.

Sam’s family welcomed me warmly, if a bit sternly. “There will be no additional houseguests,” his mom told me during my first week living there. A few weeks became three months. We worked out an arrangement whereby I’d earn my keep: I tutored Sam’s 16-year-old brother in precalculus and physics. I lived in what was essentially a walk-in closet: eight feet long and three feet wide, just large enough for a small twin mattress on the floor and my suitcase beside it.

Most of my stoner friends moved on to harder drugs. One became addicted to heroin and didn’t quit until she overdosed and was declared dead for five minutes.

When I wasn’t sleeping, tutoring, or blending smoothies, I was mostly popping pills and smoking weed. I was part of a group chat; we called ourselves “ [Bartards](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bartard&page=2) ” (“bars” is slang for Xanax). We would meet at someone’s house and smoke outside in the backyard, sitting around in a circle of lawn chairs and passing around a bong. “Mokes” or “chops” were a big thing at the time—a bowl packed with a mix of weed and tobacco, taken in one hit for a stronger high. The tobacco brought an instant head rush, and after a particularly heinous moke, you’d lean back in your chair, dizzy, nonverbal, and glassy-eyed for a minute. Throwing up was not uncommon. Part of the fun was watching everyone writhe, drool, and yes, vomit. It was almost a game; we were challenging ourselves to see how much we could take.

Plenty of young people smoke weed to make friends—to find community, even. But if you asked me what we talked about as we sat there in those backyards, I wouldn’t be able to tell you. When we were done smoking, we would part ways and do it all again the next day. I didn’t know any of these people’s birthdays or middle names. A few of my old friends—the ones who didn’t do drugs—expressed concern about the sheer volume of weed I was smoking. I had dinner with one of them, and at the end of the meal, she asked if I was high. When I sheepishly admitted I was, she made a disappointed face and said, “I wish you wouldn’t do that.”

I think Sam’s parents knew I was getting high every day, though we never spoke about it. Still, they treated me as if I were a part of the family. They taught me how to use their bread maker, including me in the nightly ritual of loading the ingredients and starting the machine. The day I turned 18, they bought me a cake and sang “Happy Birthday.” My own parents took me out to dinner that evening, but besides that, I didn’t see them much. They wanted to know what my gap-year plans were, but I had none.

All I knew was that I wanted to get out of Palo Alto, go to college, and start anew. I managed to cobble together a second round of college applications with the help of another friend’s mom, and I thought: Surely I’ll get in *somewhere*. If I could just hold on until acceptance letters came in the spring, I knew I would be all right. But at Sam’s house, I began to feel as though I had overstayed my welcome. When I was taking the dog out for a walk one afternoon, Sam’s mom gently told me, “You can’t just wake up at noon every day and sit around miserable and expect your life to get better.”

Looking back, it was the tough love I needed.

In February 2018, I left Sam’s for New Mexico, where I lived and worked on a farm at the base of the Rocky Mountains. Living in a small trailer, I learned to cook and clean for myself. I fed the sheep and chickens in the morning, and nursed newborn lambs with formula when they failed to latch. Some of them didn’t survive, and I watched their births and deaths happen just days apart. I dug their graves and said prayers to the universe.

After a year of struggling to take care of myself, I felt like I had crossed some invisible threshold of adulthood. I came off my depression medication for the first time in a year. I was still smoking weed, but less often. My relationship with my parents was better; they texted regularly to ask for photos of the animals and scenery. I was away for two months, and in that time, they drove my very old Toyota Corolla around the block once a week to keep the engine healthy.

The week I returned to Palo Alto, a thick red package came in the mail from the University of Southern California: I had been accepted.

There was no Damascene moment. I never flushed my stash. When I started college in September 2018, my social life still revolved around smoking weed. That’s the thing: By the time you realize getting high isn’t making your life that much easier, you’re hooked. Even if you’re convinced you can stop at any time. I rolled joints on the fire escape of my freshman dorm, then on the balcony of my sophomore apartment. But I was getting good grades, forging meaningful relationships with my professors, and back on a different, stronger depression medication that seemed to be working. I even had plans to spend spring break with my family in Spain. Then Covid hit, and everything fell apart.

Classes were canceled. All of my roommates left, and I spent a few days alone in my campus apartment, not wanting to return home. When I did, I had a terrible fight with my father, and I decided to stop talking to him. I returned to Los Angeles with my sister, who joined me in my student housing, where we would wake up late, smoke, and watch movies alone on our separate laptops. Our parents paid the rent. I was getting a couple hundred dollars a week in unemployment checks that I used to buy weed and pay my phone bill. Everything was easy, and I was unhappy, paralyzed with uncertainty, heartbroken about my strained relationship with my father. I didn’t want to think about any of it. That was the thing about weed. I could get high; I could forget.

I never hit the “rock bottom” that other people say stopped them smoking or suffered any horrific physical side effects like cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, which [I reported on](https://www.thefp.com/p/grass-sick-cannabinoid-hyperemesis-syndrome-marijuana) last year. In the years leading up to Covid, most of my stoner friends moved on to harder drugs. One became addicted to heroin and didn’t quit until she overdosed and was declared dead for five minutes. Around that time, fentanyl began to creep into the supply of pressed Xanax and other fake prescription pills. One of my friends died of a Xanax overdose during the first few weeks of lockdown because she took a pill from a bad batch.

That could have been my fate. But something in me began to shift.If I had to pinpoint one moment, it would be hearing my then-boyfriend say, “I’m praying for you.” Someone wanted the best for me, so much so that he would urge a higher power to make it so. I found this so moving that I began to pray on my own. For clarity of purpose, for a job offer after graduation, for reconciliation with my family—in other words, for deliverance from the worries that had plagued me throughout my early adulthood, the concerns that drove me to want to get high.

Another moment I remember: my 22nd birthday, a rainy December evening during my senior year at USC. I was single again. I was going to class in person. I still wasn’t happy. I spent the day hoping an old flame might call, but after all of my party guests went home and it became clear he wouldn’t, I was devastated. I smoked a joint and lied down in the grass outside my house—drunk, high, and alone. I lay there as the rain fell, slowly getting soaked, wallowing—and something clicked. I realized that I was choosing misery. People were praying for me. They wanted the best for me. I had to want it for myself, too.

The following week, after nearly two years of not speaking to my father, I asked if I could come home for Christmas. “Of course,” he said. At home, all the holiday traditions were still there: charades, gifts, stories of Christmases past. I told my dad I had started believing in God again. I said I was sorry for being a brat. After that, I began to call him more often, just to talk. I invited him to graduation, which was approaching fast.

As college drew to a close, I was in touch once more with the drive I had years ago, the drive that every human being has—to be a part of things. I knew that I had a duty—not necessarily to make the world a better place, but to live in it, awake and alert.

I made a plan to sell my car at the end of the summer and use the money to move to New York City, where I was certain the rest of my life would begin. What happened after that is, as they say, another story.

I’m hesitant to generalize based on my dataset of one, but if I had to give a TED Talk to 17-year-old weed addicts, I’d tell them this: If you’re smoking weed four times a day, chances are you’re not pleasant to be around. It’s never too late to say sorry. If you throw away a year of your life—or five—to weed, there is still time.

Two weeks before my parents kicked me out, my father wrote me a letter. “I think it’s going to take years before you understand my reasoning and rationale behind doing what I did. I get it that you perceive me as ‘mean,’ ” he said. “But I’m playing a long-term game, Josh. I’m not thinking about how you like me this afternoon. I’m thinking about what kind of life my son has in five years.”

And sure enough, five years later, I visited my parents for the second time since quitting weed. On a warm day in February, my father and I drank gin and tonics and grilled steak in the afternoon sun. We were aiming for medium-rare but before long, we were a little tipsy—and in such good spirits that we forgot about the meat. The steaks were well-done, but we ate them, and we didn’t complain.
