At Proton, we prioritize our community’s privacy and data security in every aspect of how we operate — from our open-source apps to our zero-access architecture.

To further demonstrate our commitment, we recently completed an in-depth external audit and — in July 2025 — successfully achieved our first SOC 2 Type II attestation, one of the most widely recognized standards for operational security in business. It provides third-party validation that we not only have strong security controls in place, but that they’re consistently followed in practice.

Here’s what this means, and what’s next for Proton.

## How we did it

At Proton, our philosophy is simple: Build strong security first, then let compliance follow.

That approach paid off. To complete the SOC 2 Type II audit, we didn’t have to overhaul how we work. We formalized and documented many of the controls already embedded in our day-to-day operations — from access management and incident response to system monitoring and risk assessment.

The audit examined the real-world implementation of our security controls across our infrastructure. This included interviews, technical reviews, and documentation checks — all conducted by [Schellman](https://www.schellman.com/), an independent, third-party auditing firm widely consulted in the tech sector.

In other words, our internal security practices were put under the microscope — and validated.

## Why we did it

Proton was built on the idea that privacy is a human right — and trust still has to be earned.

As an organization founded by scientists, we believe that independent review and public accountability are the best ways to prove a system is working — and to find and fix problems quickly when it’s not.

That’s why we make our apps open source, run a public bug bounty program, and invite penetration testing of our services. We also underwent a rigorous external audit and — on May 2, 2024 — received our [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) certification. Completing the SOC 2 Type II audit is a natural extension of this approach.

This attestation is also increasingly important for businesses evaluating tools for secure communication and collaboration. For many of these organizations — especially those in finance, healthcare, and other regulated industries — SOC 2 is a baseline requirement before moving forward with a vendor.

Proton’s SOC 2 Type II attestation proves that our security isn’t just technical — it’s operational. We meet strict, independently-audited standards for how we handle data, systems, and processes.

## What’s next

This SOC 2 Type II audit is just one piece of the bigger picture. It joins our [ISO 27001 certification](https://proton.me/blog/iso-27001-certification), [GDPR](https://proton.me/business/gdpr) and Swiss DPA compliance, and HIPAA support (when needed) — all part of building tools you can actually trust.

We’re going to keep pushing: improving our security infrastructure, making it easier for businesses to assess Proton, and sharing more about how we do our work.

Need the SOC 2 report for a vendor review or just want to take a closer look? Reach out to our team. We’re happy to walk you through it.

Thanks for being with us. We’ve got more updates coming soon to help you — and your team — stay secure.
