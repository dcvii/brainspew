#### The Rough Rider Way

The Venezuelan leader’s “outrageous treatment of foreigners who had made investments in Venezuela and his refusal to pay their just claims had led the governments to institute a blockade of Venezuelan ports.” Easy as it is to imagine a U.S. president [saying those words](https://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/digital-library/o307782/), the surprise is which one actually said them: not Donald Trump in 2026, but Theodore Roosevelt more than a century ago.

With Trump’s intervention in Venezuela being dubbed the “ [Donroe Doctrine](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/03/trump-on-monroe-doctrine-the-donroe-doctrine-after-venezuela-raid/88008767007/) ”—Donroe instead of Monroe, get it?—it’s worth recalling a forgotten crisis that engulfed Venezuela 123 years ago this winter and that ultimately inspired Roosevelt to put his own spin on the famous Monroe Doctrine with the so-called [Roosevelt Corollary](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/roosevelt-corollary).

Between December 1902 and February 1903, it was not American ships blockading Venezuela but German and British ones that their governments had sent to collect debts that the South American country owed. With the self-enriching Venezuelan dictator Cipriano Castro (no relation; it’s just a common name) refusing to meet conditions for payment, Americans worried that the British and especially the upstart Germans would seek compensation through alternative means: seizing territory. If allowed to carve up Venezuela, the European powers would make a mockery of the Monroe Doctrine.

Named for President James Monroe, the doctrine had initially appeared as nothing more than a few paragraphs tucked into his 1823 annual message to Congress. Declaring the New World closed to “future colonization by any European powers,” Monroe warned them against meddling in the newly independent republics of Latin America. As is often the case, there were some who worried about the president acting unilaterally. John C. Calhoun, then secretary of war, favored issuing a statement in concert with the British, but Secretary of State John Quincy Adams insisted it be done alone. By the start of the 20th century, Americans regarded the Monroe Doctrine as a pillar of their foreign policy and expected Roosevelt to uphold it.

“In the Western Hemisphere... the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly... to the exercise of an international police power.” —President Theodore Roosevelt in his 1904 annual message to Congress

What exactly Roosevelt did in response to the British and German blockade remains disputed. Per Roosevelt’s own account, he gave the German ambassador an ultimatum: quickly agree to arbitration with Venezuela or have an American fleet move against the ships blockading the country. The ambassador, [Roosevelt recalled](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.theodoreroos02bish/?sp=255&st=image&r=-0.153,0.096,1.236,0.696,0), “expressed very grave concern and asked me if I realized the serious consequences that would follow such action.... I answered that I had thoroughly counted the cost before I decided on the step, and asked him to look at the map, as a glance would show him that there was no spot in the world where Germany in the event of conflict with the United States would be at a greater disadvantage than in the Caribbean Sea.”

The Germans initially didn’t know what to make of the threat. Historians themselves still aren’t sure, with some even suggesting Roosevelt made up the story, given how little corroborating evidence for it has come to light. Others, such as biographer Edmund Morris and historian Frederick W. Marks III, have seen the lack of documentation instead as evidence of Roosevelt adhering to one of his favorite sayings: “Speak softly and carry a big stick—you will go far.” In this case, Roosevelt certainly had a big stick handy: He had sent America’s most famous admiral, George Dewey, to Puerto Rico with instructions to have the fleet there ready at “an hour’s notice.”

Whatever the truth, the Germans soon thought better of their approach and agreed to arbitration, as did the British. Until a settlement ended the blockade in February, though, tensions remained high. This very week in January 1903, German guns unleashed on [a Venezuelan fort](https://www.nytimes.com/1903/01/25/archives/venezuelans-hold-the-fort-germans-ceased-bombarding-san-carlos-on.html) and led to another round of American news coverage full of angst for the future of the Monroe Doctrine.

Much as Roosevelt wanted to defend the doctrine, he also didn’t want it to serve as a shield for corrupt leaders such as Cipriano Castro, who were deserving, as he put it, of a “spank.” Hence the need for a corollary: If other world powers were forbidden from punishing bad actors in the Americas, the United States would sometimes have to pick up the paddle itself. In his 1904 annual message to Congress, Roosevelt [put it this way](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/roosevelt-corollary): “In the Western Hemisphere the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.”

It’s hard to conceive a statement better suited to justify the recent Delta Force operation to apprehend Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. As our [Niall Ferguson](https://www.thefp.com/p/niall-ferguson-the-truth-about-trumps-national-security-strategy) put it, “Wrongdoing doesn’t get more chronic than Venezuela.” How the new Trump Corollary will differ from Roosevelt’s still remains to be seen. The 47th president could do worse than to follow another precedent from his predecessors and devote some lines of his [upcoming annual message](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2812), now known as the State of the Union, toward explaining.

**Something to See:** In the event of conflict with the United States, the Germans had their own war plans, which Edmund Morris writes might have included a preposterous-sounding attempt to land on Long Island and parade past Roosevelt’s house there en route to New York City. The Germans would have found it much harder than visitors today to make it to [Sagamore Hill](https://www.nps.gov/sahi/index.htm), as the must-see Roosevelt home is known. Off the side of a nearby road is the cemetery where the 26th president [lies in peace](https://www.nps.gov/places/youngs-memorial-cemetery.htm). Americans wishing to pay their respects to Monroe, who as a young man survived a wound at the Battle of Trenton in December 1776, will find his resting place at [Hollywood Cemetery](https://www.hollywoodcemetery.org/visit/things-to-see/102-president-james-monroe-s-tomb) in Richmond, Virginia, alongside the remains of his recently reburied daughter Eliza Monroe Hay. Per *[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2025/10/22/monroe-president-virginia-history/)*, researcher Barbara VornDick made it her mission to bring Hay home from France after discovering a distress letter the former first daughter had written in 1839 shortly before dying there.

#### This Week in the American Revolution

Amid a blinding snowstorm, American forces clash with the British in the 1775 Battle of Quebec. (*The Battle in Quebec City in 1775* by C.W. Jefferys)

On a screen at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump watched the Maduro raid live as it happened. Capabilities were, to say the least, very different for the commander in chief of the Continental Army 250 years ago. At his headquarters in [Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/washington-s-cambridge-headquarters.htm), George Washington had to wait until this week in 1776 to learn about the defeat American forces had suffered on the last day of 1775 at the Battle of Quebec, which we [remembered here](https://www.thefp.com/p/this-week-in-american-history-when) a couple of weeks ago.

Slowly as news traveled back then, it was no less shocking when it arrived on January 17. “We have met with a severe check in an unsuccessful attempt on Quebec,” Major General Philip Schuyler [wrote from Albany](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-03-02-0056). “I tremble for our people in Canada, and nothing, my dear sir, seems left to prevent the most fatal consequences but an immediate reinforcement, that is nowhere to be had but from you.”

Though Washington had no troops to spare around Boston, he continued to believe possession of Canada vital to victory. “To whomsoever it belongs, in their favor probably, will the balance turn,” [he wrote](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-03-02-0142).

#### Meanwhile, Across the Republic

—Anniversaries apropos of nothing: Queen of Hawaii overthrown (January 17, 1893); Green Bay Packers triumph in Super Bowl I (January 15, 1967); Ukraine given security assurances for giving up its nuclear arsenal as part of a trilateral statement signed with the United States and Russia (January 14, 1994).

—History read of the week: The honor goes to Simon Sebag Montefiore [for his essay](https://www.thefp.com/p/will-the-regime-in-iran-fall-history) on where the uprising in Iran might lead if history is any guide. “History has useful rules, and the famous quote from the first line of *Anna Karenina* applies—all stable dictatorships are alike; each fragile dictatorship is fragile in its own way,” he writes. Also, talk about good timing: David S. Brown is out with a new biography titled *[In the Arena](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781668204191)*[:](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781668204191) *[Theodore Roosevelt in War, Peace, and Revolution](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781668204191)*. It’s a timely and enlightening read (Brown and I share an editor and a publisher).

—Happy birthday, Benjamin Franklin: In celebration of Franklin turning 320 on January 17, his adopted city of Philadelphia has events at [Franklin Hall](https://www.franklincelebration.org/) and [The Franklin Institute](https://fi.edu/en/events-calendar/20260117/bens-birthday-bash).

—Elsewhere in the Keystone State, [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/pa-farm-show-butter-sculpture-2026-america-250/) reports that the Pennsylvania Farm Show in Harrisburg is celebrating America at 250 with an unusual sculpture of Franklin, Betsy Ross, and the Liberty Bell. It’s made out of 1,000 pounds of butter and will be on display only until January 17. See it before its expiration date, though the official view here is that good history never goes bad.

—Butter, er, *better* jokes will be told at *The Free Press* ’s celebration of one of America’s most endangered traditions: humor. Reserve tickets to join comics Judy Gold, Colin Quinn, and others for a February 1 discussion of the state of humor at [The Right to Laugh at New York’s Comedy Cellar](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-right-to-laugh-a-free-press-celebration).
