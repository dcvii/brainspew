### A fight about Joe Biden's pardons may escalate into a larger question about the last presidency

On Saturday, January 18th, two days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, *Racket* published “[Goodbye to Joe Biden, and Whoever Was President the Last Four Years](https://www.racket.news/p/goodbye-to-joe-biden-and-whoever).” From the piece:

> *Years ago, Republican Congressman Tom Graves [wondered about the legality of the “autopen](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/if-a-machine-can-sign-for-the-president-could-sasha-too/),” a mass-signing machine first used by the Obama administration, though George W. Bush [created the mechanism](https://www.justice.gov/file/494411/dl?inline). When Obama approved an extension of the PATRIOT Act, for instance, he “directed the use of the autopen to sign it,” putting a staff secretary in charge of his signature. Though Biden’s [use of the tool](https://www.aol.com/biden-signs-one-week-faa-203838340.html) was said to be rare, the larger problem is the competency issue exposed by [Hur’s report](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report-from-special-counsel-robert-k-hur-february-2024.pdf) and episodes like the “walk-backs.” There’s abundant evidence Joe Biden either couldn’t or didn’t have much of a say in thousands of documents bearing his signature… Was he capable of giving a machine or anyone else signing authority?*

This morning, Donald Trump on Truth Social [declared](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114175908922736427) Joe Biden’s pardons “VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT” because “they were done by Autopen.” Biden, he wrote, not only didn’t sign his own documents, but “more importantly, he did not know anything about them”:

As noted in Obama-era coverage of the autopen, federal officials have long been anxious about its use, fearing exactly this sort of challenge to the legitimacy of White House documents. That makes coverage today describing the autopen as “[ordinarily uncontroversial](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/autopen-pardons-biden-trump.html)” odd. The autopen was and is highly controversial, with aides concerned about the requirement of a [president’s physical presence](https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=lawpub) for documents. Back in 2011, *Slate* noted that the same Office of Legal Counsel under George Bush that devised infamous [torture memos](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/FilesPDFs/ACF1DBD.pdf) hesitated to use the device, and “[even](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/08/the-constitutional-quibble-with-the-autopen-it-s-not-what-you-think-it-is.html) *[President Bush](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/08/the-constitutional-quibble-with-the-autopen-it-s-not-what-you-think-it-is.html)* [never utilized an autopen](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/08/the-constitutional-quibble-with-the-autopen-it-s-not-what-you-think-it-is.html),” noting Bush “flew through the night to get to the White House in time to [sign the Terri Schiavo bill](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7212079).” Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution describes how bills must be “presented” to the president:

*From the Dunlap and Claypool printing of the Constitution, 1787*

Some outlets are now insisting Trump is relying on a [Heritage Foundation analysis](https://x.com/OversightPR/status/1899520975156216146) in addition to a *[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/03/14/us-news/trump-establishes-far-more-restrictive-autopen-rules-as-biden-aides-murmur-about-possible-misuse/)* [story](https://nypost.com/2025/03/14/us-news/trump-establishes-far-more-restrictive-autopen-rules-as-biden-aides-murmur-about-possible-misuse/) from last week, which claimed an unnamed Biden aide was using the automatic signature device for the last president in a way that was “past protocol.”

I’m not sure about that. I heard from a congressional source in December that incoming investigators had raised this question, and that the issue that would need to be resolved was how cognizant Biden was of auto-signed documents. Whether or not Trump has the ability to declare pardons “void, vacant, and of no further notice or effect” is obviously another matter. Experts quoted today seem unanimous that he cannot. Either way, Trump’s salvo brings to the forefront a major unanswered question about the Biden presidency: who made executive decisions in the last four years?
