[Freddie deBoer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrik_deBoer) is a thoughtful and perceptive writer, best known for arguing against the blank-slatest assumptions that dominate educational policy. It is commonly supposed that, if a child is doing less well at school, then that is the fault of the school or of the teachers or the curriculum... or something, and that it is the task of policy makers to identify those factors and then remove them, and so ensure that no child is “left behind”.

Such interventions don’t work. They’ve been tried multiple times and, as deBoer documents at length in his essay [Education Doesn’t Work 3.0](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/education-doesnt-work-30), they have little effect. That is, while schooling raises the ability of kids generally, all of the policy interventions ever tried do nothing to reduce the achievement gaps between the most-able and the least-able pupils. Indeed, if anything, they enhance them, because the more-capable pupils are most able to take advantage of whatever is on offer.

As deBoer says: “children who start out ahead in early childhood education stay ahead through the end of their academic careers, while the students who start out behind stay behind, in large majorities and with very few exceptions. \[...\] Reformers talk in terms of “unlocking potential” or “closing gaps”, but history shows the rank order is remarkably resistant to even the most sweeping and expensive pedagogical efforts. Intervention after intervention has failed to meaningfully affect the sticky nature of relative academic performance”.

DeBoer thus concludes that we all have: “... an inherent or innate academic potential” and that “The most direct and parsimonious explanation for this attribute is genes”. DeBoer defends his thesis capably and at length, and obviously he is entirely correct (his article contains links and citations to support his claims, which I do not reproduce here).

We’ve known this for decades. The clearest results come from studies of twins separated at birth and adopted into different families. Comparing the similarities in outcomes for identical twins (sharing 100% of genes) versus fraternal twins (sharing 50%), versus unrelated children, then tells us the relative influence of genes versus environmental factors. The answer -- counter-intuitive to many and widely ignored by society -- is that a child’s relative intellectual ability is about 70% down to their genes \[1\] and only about 10% down to “shared environment” (that is, all the factors, including family and schools, that siblings living together would share). The remaining 20% has been puzzled over. It has been attributed to “unshared environment” (experiences specific to each person), but it is hard to see how these would be more important than the totality of sibling-shared environment. Instead, it is likely that much of it is chance randomness in embryonic development (the genes provide only a recipe, not an exact blueprint, so stochastic effects in the developing brain are significant \[2\]).

This all means that educational policy makers who want to “close the gaps” between high-achieving and low-achieving children have very little to play with. Short of deliberately handicapping the high performers they are not going to succeed -- though they can, of course, provide a better education that benefits all children. But that message is anathema to many, especially to left-wing policy makers who desire greater equality of outcomes and see reforming education as a primary means of attaining that goal.

In appealing to his fellow left-wing intellectuals to wake up to the importance of genetics, deBoer (who describes himself as an “old-school Marxist”) is keen to mark out a no-go area. He is not doing race “science” (his scare quotes), saying that: “... this essay is about the persistence of individual academic differences, not group differences”. I can understand this. In talking about the role of genes at all (even restricted to individual differences) he has a hard-enough sell. Any sniff of an extension to group differences and he’ll be instantly denounced and ostracised.

But is his stance internally coherent? Throughout his article he repeatedly emphasizes that by far the biggest factor is intrinsic ability, and he documents how little anything else affects outcomes. His whole position is that environmental influences have very little effect on how a child performs academically, relative to others, and yet he still wants to explain quite-large group disparities that way. How plausible is this?

First, let’s briefly review the disparities. Black Americans typically score an average of 10 IQ points below that of white Americans (while Asian Americans score on average a few points higher than whites), and “ [the typical American black](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-black-white-test-score-gap-why-it-persists-and-what-can-be-done/) still scores below 75 percent of American whites on almost every standardized test”. Harvard has testified to the Supreme Court that if it admitted students purely on academic merit, then the fraction of black Americans admitted (currently “adjusted” to be in line with their 13% population fraction) would fall to below 1%.

In Baltimore City schools, and despite spending $22,000 per year per student, there are 13 schools [where in 2023](https://foxbaltimore.com/news/project-baltimore/at-13-baltimore-city-high-schools-zero-students-tested-proficient-on-2023-state-math-exam) “not one student who took the state math test scored proficient in math \[...\] In those 13 high schools, 1,736 students took the test, and 1,295 students, or 74.5%, scored a one out of four. One is the lowest level, meaning those students were not even close to proficient”. Those schools are >90% black students. Meanwhile, Utah (about 1% black) spends half that amount per pupil, and yet its outcomes are among the best in the US.

In principle, deBoer could be right, in that it can be the case that within-group differences are largely genetic while between-group differences are environmental. Indeed, deBoer sketches such a scenario, about a hunter-gatherer tribe where food is scarce. Within the tribe, disparity in body-mass index could be largely genetic. But now relocate a random half of them to New York, where there is ready availability of high-fat food. After a while, the difference in the mean BMI of the two halves of the tribe would be entirely environmental.

But surely that sort of environmental influence would be easy to detect? The problem for deBoer is not that group differences cannot be purely environmental, it is that he has to argue that purely environmental differences are powerful enough to explain substantial group differences, and at the same time so subtle that we haven’t been able to detect them.

When considering educational outcomes our first guess at the important environmental factors -- the counterpart of the availability of food in the above analogy -- would be schooling. And yet, deBoer documents at length that differences between schools make little difference to a child’s academic outcome. As he says: “There is no evidentiary basis for the conventional wisdom that schooling can change the performance of students relative to their peers” and “This must be underlined: a large body of research shows that randomly placing students into various schools, often dramatically different schools, has no impact on student outcomes”. And he quotes Douglas K Detterman saying “Teachers account for from 1% to 7% of total variance at every level of education. For students, intelligence accounts for much of the 90% of variance associated with learning gains”. His conclusion is that “There is no such entity as school quality. The concept is an illusion”, and that differences in outcomes are down to “the underlying ability of the students in a school”.

DeBoer is spot on when he asks: “Are students constantly jumping around in the student rankings as they cycle through different teachers from grade to grade, as you’d expect from a purely environmentalist perspective? No, of course not. Because they’re the same kids. Why doesn’t this simple wisdom penetrate policy and politics?”

But if we reject the environmentalist perspective for *individual* differences, then isn’t that perspective for *group* differences then in deep trouble? If schools can have little effect on the relative performance of an individual child then it’s hard to argue that they can have a large effect on the relative performance of groups of children.

Children spend 6 or 7 hours in school for each of 180 days a year for most years of their childhood. It is surely a major component of their environment. So, if that has little effect on relative attainment, then what does? Well, there’s also peer groups, and of course families.

But deBoer then discounts peer effects: “How about peer effects, \[...\] Like class size, this factor is often cited as having a causative impact on learning, but the evidence is slight.” He points to scenarios “where, thanks to school lotteries, students were placed with much more academically equipped peers than they had been previously”, but studies find “no meaningful impact on student outputs”. Another study “taking advantage of a kind of natural experiment made possible by thousands of low-achieving students fleeing Hurricane Katrina, looked at the opposite case and yet similarly found no meaningful effects”.

As for family environment, again, studies show that “shared environment” is far less influential than commonly supposed. Summarising the literature, Robert Plomin et al say “Academic achievement consistently shows some shared environmental influence, presumably due to the effect of schools, although the effect is surprisingly modest in its magnitude (about 15% for English and 10% for Mathematics) given that this result is based on siblings growing up in the same family and being taught in the same school”, and “... shared environmental influence is found for intelligence up until adolescence and then diminishes as adolescents begin to make their own way in the world,...” \[3\].

Do adopted children develop in line with the cognitive abilities of their adopted parents, or of their biological parents? The Colorado Adoption Project tells us the answer: “Children increasingly resemble their parents in cognitive abilities from infancy through adolescence. Results obtained from a 20-year longitudinal adoption study of 245 adopted children and their biological and adoptive parents, as well as 245 matched nonadoptive (control) parents and offspring, show that this increasing resemblance is due to genetic factors. Adopted children resemble their adoptive parents slightly in early childhood but not at all in middle childhood or adolescence. In contrast, during childhood and adolescence, adopted children become more like their biological parents, and to the same degree as children and parents in control families. Although these results were strongest for general cognitive ability and verbal ability, similar results were found for other specific cognitive abilities” \[4\].

Thus, the evidence is that family environments matter much less than commonly supposed. The fact that children of successful parents tend to be successful is mostly not a result of a better childhood environment, but instead because parents have passed on genes for being successful. Similarly, we know that family socio-economic status is not a prime cause of disparities, since it’s easy to compare racial groups while matching SES, and SES does nothing to explain gaps in academic achievement (Asian-American families often start with low SES, since many are recent immigrants from countries that are still relatively poor, and yet their children tend to do well). Yes, there is a *correlation* between SES and IQ, but the dominant *causation* is genetic: parents who are successful have higher incomes, and also pass on genes that lead to success; parents who are less successful have lower incomes, and also pass on genes that result in less success.

But perhaps it’s all about the pre-school environment? Again deBoer discounts this: “Nor does pre-K, the most commonly cited cure-all for educational inequality, seem to have much effect, although as you’d imagine the topic is very contentious”, and “We have very recent evidence in this regard in the form of \[...\] a pre-K study that has many virtues, including a large n, genuine random assignment, and a longitudinal component, and it says kids who were assigned to the pre-K condition actually did worse than kids who were not. This paper is particularly discouraging for advocates,...”.

So what options are left those for who want to attribute all differences in mean racial outcomes purely to environmental factors? None of the above seem to serve. That leaves factors that are necessarily specific to that race, something about Chinese-American culture and experiences (on the one hand) and something about black-American culture and experiences (on the other).

Freddie deBoer himself does not expound on what he thinks the factors are (to be fair, his essay is about individual variation, and he mostly mentions group disparities only to say that he’s not talking about them). He does talk about the “the deep inequalities that likely produce achievement gaps”, but that’s really just saying that inequalities are caused by inequalities, without identifying the causative factors.

DeBoer’s essay is all about arguing that nothing except intrinsic ability has any large effect on relative outcomes: “What pedagogical or administrative or technological or social or communicative or political interventions reliably produce meaningful academic benefits such that those “left behind” improve their station? What works? Nothing”.

So, when it comes to group differences, he has ruled out all of the major candidate factors, and all he’s left with is the idea that the disparities are caused by a whole host of different things, all of them too small to be discerned or identified: “My assumption, or guess, is that such group differences are the result of environmental and social factors that are particularly hard to address because they are massively multivariate; it’s much easier to address individual influences of large effect than a very large number of influences of very small effect”.

This remains in-principle possible, but is speculation rather than being an evidence-based explanation. Ideas of “systemic racism” were invented mostly because there is little evidence for actual racism acting today that is sufficient to explain the outcomes for children born in the 2000s. It is supposed to be so powerful that it has a huge effect on outcomes, and yet so subtle and hidden that it cannot be discerned. When pressed, activists tell you that we don’t notice it precisely because it is so ubiquitous, and make an analogy to fish not noticing water.

Isn’t it much simpler and more parsimonious to suppose that genetics, so dominant in explaining differences in individual ability, could also be a significant factor in group differences? Yes it is heresy, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be true. (And here I’m not attempting to survey the positive arguments for that conclusion, I’m just examining the internal logic of deBoer’s essay.) Too many treat this matter as a moral issue, when instead it is purely factual, about how the world is, not how we wish it were. In the end reality matters, and one is not going to help those who one is trying to help if the basic diagnosis is wrong.
