### Something small is happening

Small Data SF returns to San Francisco on November 4-5, 2025, bringing together developers and data practitioners for two days of workshops and talks that challenge the "bigger is always better" mentality in data and AI. Join us to explore the philosophy that's reshaping how we think about data processing!**Day 1 (November 4):** Hands-on workshops where you'll learn practical techniques for efficient data processing, local-first development, and building AI applications that don't require a cluster to run.**Day 2 (November 5):** A full day of talks from industry leaders who are redefining what's possible when you optimize for simplicity, speed, and developer experience rather than theoretical scale.

Small Data isn't just about datasets that fit on a single machine—it's about efficiency in making big data feel small, processing data in smaller pieces before it gets too big, embracing local-first development, and choosing simplicity over unnecessary scale. With computers now one hundred times more powerful than during the early Big Data hype, it's time to focus on the underrated joys and untapped potential of laptops, cloud machines, and edge computing. This same philosophy extends to Small AI, where smaller, optimized models offer speed, flexibility, and practical deployment options without the overhead of massive infrastructure. Because sometimes the question isn't "How big is your data?" but "How efficiently can you process it?"

The Small Data (& AI) Movement is already underway. Are you in?

### Manifesto

##### It’s time to think small.

We believe in the Simple Joys of Small Data.

It’s finally possible to hold Big Data in the palm of your hand.

Is that Big Data or Small Data? That’s for you to decide.

Local-first development is more powerful than you think.

Modern hardware is a beast.

Small models drive huge impact.

Small data, smart AI.

Think small, develop locally, ship joyfully.

Single Machines are Efficient and Powerful.

Simplicity is scalable: chaos and complexity are not.

Scale-up workflows are highly efficient, with 400X more memory than 10 years ago.

Let’s focus on delightful user experiences instead of fumbling with complex infrastructure.

We can save distributed compute for when we really need it most.

Single machines rule.

Developing Locally Just Works.

Local dev delivers instant results, while local + edge computing unlock powerful new experiences.

Ditch the distributed complexity when you don’t need it.

Not everything we build should require inefficient containers or a round-trip to the cloud.

Hardware and laptops are 100X more powerful, yet we leave this compute dormant and unused.

We believe in developing locally and shipping to prod with the same software.

Together, we can end the cloud hangover and support local analytics.

Small data and AI is more valuable than you think.
