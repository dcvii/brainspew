What is Kimi K2

Kimi K2 is a state-of-the-art open-weight mixture-of-experts (MoE) large language model developed by Moonshot AI, a Beijing-based startup backed by Alibaba. Released in July 2025, it features 32 billion activated parameters and a total of 1 trillion parameters, making it one of the largest open-source models available. It excels in areas like frontier knowledge, mathematics, coding, and agentic tasks (such as automated workflows and tool usage), often outperforming open-source competitors like DeepSeek V3, Qwen 2.5, and LLaMA 4 on benchmarks.Key Variants and Features
- Kimi-K2-Instruct: A post-trained version optimized for general-purpose chat, instruction-following, and agentic experiences. It supports up to 256K tokens of context (expanded from 128K in earlier updates) and strong tool-calling capabilities.
- Kimi-K2-Base: The foundational model for fine-tuning and custom applications.
- Kimi K2 Thinking: An advanced November 2025 release that builds on the base model, enabling autonomous execution of 200–300 sequential tool calls for complex problem-solving with minimal human input. Trained for $4.6 million, it's designed for "open agentic intelligence."
The model is accessible via the Kimi chatbot app (free with rate limits; paid tiers like Moderato, Allegretto, and Vivace for higher usage), an OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible API on platform.moonshot.ai, and open-source checkpoints on Hugging Face and GitHub under a modified MIT license. It's praised for affordability and performance but may require prompt engineering for optimal results.
