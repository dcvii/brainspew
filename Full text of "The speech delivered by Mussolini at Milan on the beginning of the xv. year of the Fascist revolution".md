THE SPEECH DELIVERED 
BY MUSSOLINI 
AT MILAN 

ON THE BEGINNING OF THE XV. YEAR OF THE FASCIST REVOLUTION 

1st November XV. Year of the Eascisl Era 
I. of the Empire 

The Duce’s lofty words 

In the presence of about, half a million persons 
assembled in the largest square at Milan, Benito 
Mussolini, Founder of the Empire, delivered a 
speech on Sunday the 1 st novernber, the XV. Year 
of the Fascist Era and on the conclusion of the 
celebrations for the XIV. Year of the Fascist Revo¬ 
lution. 

The speech was broadcast by wireless practically 
all through the world. In elevated words the Head 
of the Government outlined the orders of march 
for Italy in the European and world policy. 

The text of the speech is given below. 

Fascist Italy and the other people 

of Europe 

Blackshirts of Milan! 

With the speech that I am going to deliver 
here before you and for which I request, and you 
will certainly give me, a few minutes of your 
attention, I intend to fix the position of Fascist 
Italy in so far as concerns her relations with the 
other people of Europe in this turbid and disquiet¬ 
ing moment. 

The high level of your political education con¬ 
sents my laying out before you those problems that 

. 5 

elsewhere are debated in the so-called Parliaments 
or at the end of so-called Democratic banquets. 

I will be extremely succint, but I must add that 
each of my words has been meditated. 

Making a clean slare of all illusions 

If it is desired to clarify the European atmo¬ 
sphere it is necessary first of all to make a tabula 
rasa of all the illusions, of all the commonplaces 
and of all the conventional lies which still consti¬ 
tute the relics of the great shipwreck of Wilsonian 
idealology. 

One of these illusions is aground: it is the illu¬ 
sion of disarmament. No one wants to be the first 
to disarm and general disarmament is impossible 
and absurd. And yet, when the Disarmament Con¬ 
ference met at Geneva, this question was in full 
function. It consisted in inflating bladders until 
they became mountains and on these mountains 
all the lime-light from the search-lights of world 
publicity is concentrated for a few days so that 
at a certain moment a diminuitive mouse emerges 
from them and it is lost in the labyrinths of a pro¬ 
cedure that as regards fertile expedients is without 
precedent in history. 

For us Fascists, accustomed to examine with 
cold eye the reality of life and of history, another 
illusion which we refute is that passing under the 
name of collective security. Collective security has 
never existed, does not exist, will never exist. A 
virile people brings about its own collective secu¬ 

6 

rity on its frontiers and refuses to entrutst its 
destiny into the uncertain hands of third parties. 

Another commonplace which must be refuted 
is indivisible peace. Indivisible peace could only 
have this meaning: indivisible war; but nations 
refuse, and rightly too, to fight for interests which 
do not concern them. 

The League of the economic siege 

The same League of Nations is based upon an 
absurdity which consists in the criterion of the 
absolute juridical parity of all the States, while 
States differ from each other, at least according 
to the point of view of their historical responsibility. 

As far as the League of Nations is concerned 
the dilemma is placed in the clearest of terms: 
either to be renewed or to perish. 

Since it is extremely difficult that it can be re¬ 
newed, as far as we are concerned, it can calmly 
perish. In any case we have not forgotten, and 
we will not forget, that the League of Nations or¬ 
ganized with methods of diabolical diligence, the 
iniquituous siege against the Italian people; 
attempted to starve this people in its concrete living 
reality of men, women and children; sought to 
break our military effort and the work of civili¬ 
zation that was beng carried out at about 4.000 
kilometres away from the mother country. It was 
not successful, not because it did not wish to, but 
because it found facing it (The crowd shouts: « II 
Duce ») the solid unity of the Italian people capa- 

. 7 

hie of all the sacrifices and also of waging war 
against fifty-two States in coalition. 

The point 

After all, to pursue a policy of peace it is not 
necessary to pass through the lobbies of the League 
of Nations. Here, 0 Comrades, I make what in na¬ 
vigation is called a point. After seventeen years of 
polemics, friction, misunderstandings and of cjues- 
tions left in abeyance, in Janauary 1935 agree¬ 
ments with France were concluded. 

The agreements with France frozen 

These agreements could and should have opened 
up a new era of really friendly relations between 
the two countries. But the Sanctions intervened. 
Naturally the friendship was frozen for the first 
time. 

We were on the threshold of winter. Winter 
passed and spring came and with spring our 
triumphant victories. Sanctions continued to be 
applied with a truly meticulous rigor. 

We had been at Addis Abeba for at least two 
months and still Sanctions continued. A classic 
example of the letter that kills the spirit, of for¬ 
malism strangling the livng concrete reality of 
existence. 

France still today holds its finger pointing to the 
age-yellowed archives of Geneva and says: The 
Empire of the very much former Lion of Judah is. 
still alive. » 

8 

But beyond the registers of Geneva what is the- 
message of the reality of our victory? That the 
empire of the Negus is more than dead. 

It is plainly evident that so long as the French 
Government maintains towards us an attitude of 
waiting reserve we cannot hut do likewise. 

Good relations with Switzerland 

and Austria 

One of the countries bordering with Italy and 
with which our relations have been, are and will 
alw 7 ays be extremely friendly, is Switzerland. A 
small country, but of the greatest importance both 
because of its ethnology and of the geographical 
position it occupies in the crossroads of Europe. 

Following the agreements of the 11th July a new 
era was opened in the history of modern Austria- 
The agreements of the 11th July — hasty and mis¬ 
informed commentators should make a note of this 
— were known to me and approved since the 5th 
June, and it is my conviction that these agreements 
have strengthened the stalal structure of that coun¬ 
try and have also further guaranteed its inde¬ 
pendence. 

Justice for Hungary 

Until justice is done to Hungary there can be 
no definitive systematisation of the interests in the 
Danubian Basin. 

Hungary is truly the great mutile: four million 
Magyars live beyond its present frontiers. In order 

. 9 

to follow the dictates of an abstract justice, another 
injustice has been committed, perhaps even 
greater. 

The feelings of the Italian people towards the 
Magyar nation are based on the sincere recognition, 
which after all is reciprocal, of its military qualities, 
its courage and spirit of sacrifice. 

Perhaps before long there will be a solemn 
occasion during which these feelings of the Italian 
people will be publicly and clamorously manifested. 

Towards a concrete friendship 

with Yugoslavia 

The fourth country bordering with Italy is 
Yugoslavia. During recent times the atmosphere 
between the two coutries greatly improved. You 
remember that two year$ ago in this same square 
1 made a clear allusion of the possibilty that cordial 
friendly relations between the two countries could 
be established. I resume today this argument and 
I declare that by now necessary and sufficient 
conditions exist of a moral, political and economic 
character, to place on a new basis a concrete 
friendship, the relations between the two countries. 

The entente with Germany 

Besides the above which are the four countries 
bordering with Italy, a large country during these 
last few days earned extensive sympathy in the 
masses of the Italian people. I allude to Germany. 

The meeting at Berlin resulted in an agreement 

10 

between the tw T o countries on certain questions, 
some of which particularly interesting in these days.. 
But these agreements, that have been included in 
special statements and were duly signed, this vertical 
line between Rome and Lerlin is not a partition but 
rather an axis around . which all the European 
States animated with the will of collaboration and 
peace, can also collaborate. Germany, although 
surrounded and solicited, did not adhere to 
Sanctions. By means of the agreement of the 11th 
July an element of dissension between Berlin and 
Rome disappeared and I remind you that even 
before the Berlin meeting, Germany had practically 
recognized the Empire of Rome. 

We hoist the flag of anti-Bolshevism 

It is not a matter for surpise that today we hoist 
the flag of anti-Bolshevism. But this is our old flag. 

But we were born under that sign, but we 
have w r aged war against that enemy and we 
conquered him by means of our sacrifices and our 
blood. 

Because what is known as Bolshevism or Com¬ 
munism does not date from today, pay attention to 
what I say, and it is not today but a State super - 
Capitalism elevated to its most fierce expression: it 
is not, therefore, a negation of the system but the 
continuation and the sublimation of that system. 
And it is high time to end placing in contrast 
Fascism and Democracy. It can truly be said that 
this great Italy of ours is also the great unknown. 

11 

We are not the embalmers of a past, 
we anticipate the future 

If many of these ministers, members of Parlia¬ 
ment and people of the same kind who speak 
on hearsay, would decide at last to cross the Italian 
frontier, they would be convinced tbal if a country 
does exist where true Democracy has been realized, 
that country is Fascist Italy. Because we. O' 
Reactionaries of all the countries, real and authentic 
Reactionaries of all the countries, we are not the 
embalmers of a past: we anticipate the future. 

We do not extend to the extreme limits the capi¬ 
talistic civilization, above all in its mechanical 
aspect, almost anti-human, we created a new 
synthesis and through Fascism we open the door 
for the human and true civilization of labour. 

Italy is an Island in the 
Mediterranean 

So far I have dealt with the Continent. But Italy 
is as island. Italians must gradually acquire an 
insular mentality because this is the only w r ay to 
place on the right level the questions relating to 
the naval defence of the nation. 

Italy is an island that emerges in the Mediter¬ 
ranean. 

This sea (I here also speak to the British who 
perhaps at this moment are listening on the 
wireless), this sea for Great Britain is a route, one 

12 . 

of the many routes, rather a short-cut, through 
which the British Empire can reach more rapidly 
the territories at its circumference. It may be said 
incidentally that when an Italian, Negrelli, planned 
the cutting of the Isthmus of Suez, more than 
anywhere else be was considered a madman in 
England. 

The Mediterranean is a road for the 
others, for Italy it is life 

If for others the Mediterranean is a route, for 
us Italians it is life. 

We said a thousand times and I repeat before 
this magnificent crowd, that we do not intend to 
threaten this route. We do not propose to interrupt 
it, lmt we expect on the other hand that also our 
vital rights and interests be respected. There are 
no alternatives: it is necessary that the thinking 
minds in the British Empire should realize that the 
fact is accomplished and irrevocable. The sooner 
the better. A bilateral clash is not to be thought 
of and much less a clash that from being bilateral 
would immediately become European. 

Consequently there is only one solution: a 
sincere, rapid and complete agreement based on 
the recognition of reciprocal interests. 

But if it were otherwise; if truly, a thing that 
I exclude from today, it is contemplated to choke 
the life of the Italian people in that sea which was 
Rome’s, well then, let it he known that the Italian 
people would jump up like one man (Cries of Yes! 

. 13 

Yes!) ready for combat with a decision that would 
have few precedents in history. 

Armed peace 

Milanese Comrades let us turn to ourselves. The 
orders of march for the XV. Year are the following: 
peace with everyone, with those near and far, but 
armed peace. 

Hence our programme of armaments in the sky,, 
in the sea and on land will be regularly developed. 

The productive energies of the Nation will be 
speeded up in the fields of agriculture and industry. 
The corporative system will be continued until its. 
definitive realization. 

But there is an order that I will entrust to 
you, 0 Milanese of this most ardent and most 
Fascist Milan that revealed in these days its great 
soul, that I will entrust to you, 0 Milanese of this 
generous laborious and iufatigahle Milan. This 
order, which 1 feel sure will become to you at the 
same time that I pronounce it an imperative duty, 
is that you should place yourselves as you will do, 
at the vanguard for the exploitation of the Empire 
in order to render it, in the shortest possible time, 
an element of welfare, power and glory for the 
country.
