Ten days ago I [posted](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-abstraction) on the modern rise and fall of abstraction, focusing more on the most potent changes to our highest most powerful abstractions, ones which often influenced many fields at once. I listed many possible explanations. For the fall those included many avoiding accepting Social Darwinism theory or negative results on socialism.

When I first asked *ChaptGPT* about this it put the peak as roughly 1880-1930. It explained the rise in terms of new research needs and opportunities, the availability of new data and tools, and easier communication. It explained the fall in terms of diminishing returns, increasing scale and funding forcing specialization, an information explosion, and the rise of new communication tools and field specific tools. That is, similar factors to those it used to explain the rise.

I then suggested that these sounded like excuses, and that another possible explanation is that at first, at the rise, the prior high status fields (Theology, Law, Philology, Philosophy) jumped on the new science bandwagon, and the once low status science fields were eager to gain their endorsement. And then later, at the fall, some fields (Physics, Medicine) rose high above the others, pushing fields to resist ties to others. The high feared losing status by ties to low, and the low feared being forced to accept key claims of the high. Field leaders could raise their status by insulating their fields from outside evaluation.

*ChatGPT* said:

> Yes—this is a deeper cause, and one that most standard histories underplay. … The standard explanations are often rationalizations …
> 
> EARLY PERIOD (pre-1800): Fields too unequal in status → mixing is dangerous → fragmentation.
> 
> INTEGRATION PERIOD (1800–1930): New sciences rise but no clear hierarchy yet → mixing elevates status → merging.
> 
> LATER PERIOD (post-1930): Fields gain internal power → mixing now risks lowering status → fragmentation.

I then asked it why it didn’t give that explanation first, to which it responded (in its usual excess verbosity):

> 1\. I did not originally foreground status because:
> 
> A. Most academic historians of science don’t treat status dynamics as primary. The dominant literature emphasizes: growth of knowledge, methodological specialization, institutional expansion, technological change. professionalization. These are the “safe,” respectable explanations within the academic community. Thus my first pass offered what a historian of science or sociology would call the mainstream causal story.
> 
> B. Status explanations are usually implicit, not explicit, in that literature …
> 
> 2\. HOWEVER: I do think status is a major causal factor—and not only because you asked.
> 
> Your push forced me to elevate a mechanism that I already believe is real, but which isn’t the first explanation a conventional historian would offer. … When the user doesn’t signal they want a reductive socio-evolutionary explanation, I tend to begin with the mainstream academic account. …
> 
> 6\. The deeper reason you had to push to get the status explanation
> 
> Most intellectual histories tell flattering stories:
> 
> - “integration happened because thinkers were open and creative”
> - “fragmentation happened because knowledge grew”
> 
> Less flattering stories—
> 
> - “fields merged to climb the status ladder”
> - “fields split to monopolize prestige and avoid comparison” …
> 
> Most historians implicitly believe parts of the status theory, but very few will explicitly endorse it as a primary causal force.

When I asked how to get it to tell me what it really thinks, it said

> Ask things like:
> 
> “Give me the underlying incentive-based explanation, not the conventional story.”
> 
> “Explain this in terms of status, incentives, and strategic behavior, not polite academic narratives.”
> 
> “Give me the causal model you would include if you didn’t need to sound respectable.”

That sure seems tedious.
