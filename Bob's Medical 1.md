Speaker 1

0:01

Okay, Mr. B story. So I talked to Debbie this morning, and she's coming tomorrow. I'll pick her up in the airport at 1030 she's coming in on Delta. She only bought a one way ticket because she had no idea, as we have no idea, how good Mr. B is or not, period.

0:24

So

0:27

I drove over to Kaiser,

Speaker 1

0:31

and first I went to urgent care, but he's not in urgent care. Emergency is separate, so I went over to emergency, and emergency is is big. I mean, it's huge. And he's in treatment room one,

0:50

so

0:52

you have to do a z,

Speaker 1

0:56

plus, I had to wait for a minute to come out because they could only have one visitor at a time when he's in emergency, but there's treatment rooms, and he was in number one. They're at least 25

1:12

and there's two nurses stations,

1:14

so

1:18

place was really busy. Where's the

Speaker 1

1:23

Kaiser? Kaiser West, la on Cadillac. And, yeah, that place.

1:30

So

Speaker 1

1:33

as soon as I sat down, he woke up, and we started talking, and he said he's really bored in there, but immediately I took a picture of his vitals. So his blood pressure is up to 100 over something. So he's hooked up. He has the oxygen measure on his finger. He has blood pressure cuff. He has a sensor over his heart and his

2:11

his pee bag is hooked up. Okay,

Speaker 1

2:16

so I went over to the nurses station to talk to.

2:25

I forget her name,

2:27

but it's four letters,

Speaker 1

2:32

and then she gave me details. She says she's been trying to get him a room all morning, and she calls them and they're not around, but she would come over in a bit and see how we were doing and check up. But she was real busy. Everybody's real busy. The place is really crowded. So we talked a lot. I found out what his 10 top 10 favorite foods are,

Speaker 2

3:09

okay, so I just want to know how Mr. B is doing. Just gets good too.

Speaker 1

3:14

He's fine. He's bored. He's talking okay when he's not sleeping. He seems to be sleeping a lot. His foot are swollen like some homeless person on the street, really, I would have, I wouldn't have been surprised if there were worms crawling out of this. Well, said that he has edema, yeah, so he's got one sock on and one sock off. I thumped him on his toes. So you feel that? Well, I want to know, did he feel it? Yeah, he did.

Speaker 1

3:51

He sees he's bored. He didn't have any TV. The nurse brought some lunch. Okay, so he started complaining that it was cold. He had carrots and rice and tomato soup and blueberries and apple juice and carrots. Did I say carrots and something else that looked like chicken rice? I don't know, okay, but he complained because it was cold, okay? And I said, Well, your soup isn't cold, but he didn't want any soup, and he gave me the blueberries. He needed help opening up his plastic bag of forks, and he couldn't get the peel off the apple juice.

4:37

So he's weak.

Speaker 1

4:42

And then there's no signal in there, so I couldn't communicate in or out.

4:50

Then

Speaker 1

4:53

the guy came by and said abana was back, so I had to go. And I was there for about an hour and a half. Found out stuff about his college life, which was his favorite time. And then I said, Yeah, I'm gonna go get some lunch. So I went and got some lunch. I came back at about 230 and he had moved to the hospital. So he's got a room. He's in room 2830, okay, abana was outside. She had a bag of chips. She had about three bags of chips in her purse. Okay, so she was munching.

5:37

And I went up to see him

Speaker 2

5:41

around three o'clock to now there's more than one person allowed to go visit. Yes,

Speaker 1

5:45

because I know I saw the people in line in front of me is three people. So, yeah, so he's on the second floor and across the Skyway. And he was dead sleep, so I just left him there. I took more pictures of his vitals. Blood pressure is still over 100 Well, it's 100 still low. It's not dangerously low, okay, but it's stable. It didn't change at all, the whole time I was there and when I came back, why are they keeping him? Because they have to figure out what combination of antibiotics he needs that won't interfere with possible problems with his heart. So they don't they haven't identified exactly the nature of the urinary tract infection. So once they do that, they'll figure that out, and then they have to figure out whether or not his low heart rate and low blood pressure are consequence of the Lupron or luprex or something like that, one of the other two medications that they're giving him. One of them, they know it might be the other one, they don't know if there's an interaction. So he's going to be there until he can get a doctor's time, but the place is jam packed, and I didn't even see doctors walking by, so the doctors are all tied up.

7:35

So that's pretty much the picture.

7:41

So Debbie is coming.

Speaker 1

7:42

Debbie is coming. She has a 1030 flight, pick her up and bring her here so she can chill out, freshen up, get ready to go, okay, and then she can stay here. She can stay at abanas place, at

7:59

there, okay,

Speaker 2

8:00

and she decided what she's gonna do yet or

Speaker 1

8:05

No, she hasn't decided how long she's gonna stay. She doesn't know how she's gonna react, so that's why she left it open. She only bought a one way ticket.

8:14

Okay. Okay.

Speaker 2

8:24

So Wes was tomorrow, I'm gonna come in and chill out, and then you take her back over there, yep, and then

8:37

let's see what happened from there, yep,

Speaker 1

8:39

okay, hopefully there will have been a doctor. that sees him today.

8:45

And we'll get some updated information.
