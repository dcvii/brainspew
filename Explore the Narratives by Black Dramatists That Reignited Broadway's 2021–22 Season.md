When Broadway reopened in the fall of 2021 after an 18-month closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, history was soon made as seven plays by Black playwrights debuted during the 2021–22 Broadway season. Noting a previous scarcity of Black writers for Broadway in a June 24, 2021 [*New York Times* article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/theater/chicken-biscuits-broadway-lyons-lewis-urie.html), theater reporter Michael Paulson observed “These plays arrive at a time of intensified attention to racial inequity in many corners of society including the theater industry.”  
  
Indeed, in 2020 initiatives including [We See You White America Theatre](https://www.weseeyouwat.com/) and [Black Theatre United](http://www.blacktheatreunited.com/) were created to hold commercial and non-profit theater accountable and to increase opportunities for Black theater makers and other artists of color, particularly in behind the scenes positions on Broadway and regionally. The unprecedented 2021–22 season was widely written about in the press with Black journalists in particular taking note. A sample of the articles written include “Broadway’s Banner Season for Black Playwrights” by Patrick Bradford in the Spring 2022 issue of  [*Black Masks*](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b21426191) and Kelundra Smith’s two 2023 pieces: " [Broadway May Be Back, But Who Is it For?](https://www.americantheatre.org/2021/11/09/broadway-may-be-back-but-who-is-it-for/)” published in *American Theatre* and “ [What Broadway is Showing Us About Grief](https://andscape.com/features/what-broadway-is-showing-us-about-grief/) ” published by the website Andspace.

The seven plays produced on Broadway during the 2021–22 season were written by dramatists at different stages in their careers. There were entries by established and award-winning artists including Lynn Nottage, Dominique Morisseau, and Ruben Santiago-Hudson. For a different cohort of playwrights—Douglas Lyons, Antoinette Nwandu, and Keenan Scott II—this moment provided them with visibility and new audiences. Lastly, for Alice Childress (1912–1994), the multi-hyphenate artist and activist whose works are now experiencing a renaissance in the theater, it was bittersweet. Her play *Trouble in Mind* was supposed to have opened on Broadway in the 1950s and it took over 60 years for the play to receive its belated premiere on the Great White Way. During  *Trouble in Mind’s* 2021 Broadway run, Doug Reside, the Lewis and Dorothy Cullman Curator of the Library for the Performing Arts' Theatre Collection, wrote a  [blog post](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2021/11/18/alice-childress-trouble-mind-archive) examining archival materials about the play from the  [Alice Childress Papers](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b16443983) which are held at the Schomburg Center and items from other collections at LPA that document the original Off-Broadway production and revivals in the U.S. and abroad.  
  
Below, I reflect on the plays by Black dramatists that re-opened Broadway during the 2021–22 season in the order that they were produced. In most cases, researchers can access the play scripts at either the [Library for the Performing Arts](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa) (LPA) or the  [Schomburg Center](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg). In many cases, library card holders can view the performances at LPA’s  [Theatre on Film and Tape Archive (TOFT).](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/theatre-film-and-tape-archive)

## Plays by Black Playwrights That Premiered on Broadway in 2021–22

- [![Pass Over by Antoinette Nwandu](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-06%2FPass%2520Over.png%3Fitok%3DCZ8ZV-OQ&w=256&q=75)](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22030127)
	### Pass Over
	*Pass Over*, a surreal drama by Antoinette Nwandu, was called a mashup of Samuel Beckett’s play  *Waiting for Godot* and the biblical Exodus story. A developmental production of the play was presented through The Cherry Lane Theater’s Mentor Project program in 2016. A different version of the play was published by Samuel French after its 2018 Off-Broadway premiere at Lincoln Center Theater. LPA  [filmed a performance of the Broadway production](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22622344) which can be seen in the Theatre on Film and Tape Archive. The Broadway version of the play has not been published, but the  [typescript](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22855025) is also available at LPA.
- [![Lackawanna Blues](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-07%2Flackawanna-blues-poster.jpg%3Fitok%3DZ3MzChfI&w=256&q=75)](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22640834)
	### Lackawanna Blues
	Ruben Santiago-Hudson’s autobiographical solo show with music which pays homage to his colorful upbringing in a Lackwanna, New York boardinghouse was first produced Off-Broadway at the Public Theater in 2001. The play was adapted into a made-for-television film that was directed by George C. Wolfe and released in 2005. *Lackawanna Blues* premiered on Broadway in 2021 and was  [filmed by TOFT](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22640834) where it can be seen in the archives. The play script has not yet been published which I hope will be remedied soon!
- [![Chicken & Biscuits](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-06%2FChicken%2520%2526%2520Biscuits.png%3Fitok%3D4tphz_v2&w=256&q=75)](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b23012944)
	### Chicken & Biscuits
	Douglas Lyons established himself as a performer in the musicals *The Book of Mormon* and  *Beautiful: The Carol King Musical* before unveiling his dramatic writing. His comedy  *Chicken & Biscuits* had the distinction of being directed by Zhailon Levingston in, who at the time was one of the youngest directors to work on Broadway. *Chicken & Biscuits* was presented at Circle in the Square Theater and starred Broadway veteran Norm Lewis. It has gone on to be presented at theaters regionally and adapted into a made for television film called  *A Jenkins Family Christmas*.
- [![Thoughts of a Colored Man](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-06%2FThoughts%2520of%2520a%2520Colored%2520Man.png%3Fitok%3D8-Df54YV&w=256&q=75)](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b23335628)
	### Thoughts of a Colored Man
	The journey for a professional production of Kenan Scott II’s spoken word-driven play *Thoughts of a Colored Man* can be traced back to 2017 when the actor and author Taye Diggs was attached to this project as a director and staged readings of the play. It received its regional premiere in 2019 in a co-production between Syracuse Stage and Baltimore Center Stage. The play “celebrates the hopes, ambitions, joys and triumphs of black men in a world that refuses to hear them.”  [TOFT filmed the play](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22667380) and the play’s script was subsequently published in 2022.
- [![Trouble in Mind](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-06%2FTrouble%2520in%2520Mind%2520TCG.jpg%3Fitok%3D7iJROqe3&w=256&q=75)](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22918553)
	### Trouble in Mind
	*Trouble in Mind*, a backstage dramedy about an African American actor Wiletta Mays who causes a stir when she expresses concerns about the stereotypically written role she is cast to play, was slated to be transferred to Broadway in 1957. However, when author Alice Childress refused to make the play palatable at the producers’ request, the production was shelved. The 2021 Broadway show was  [filmed by TOFT](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22675954). The version of the play that was eventually presented on Broadway was published both in the anthology  [*Plays by American Women, 1930–1960*](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b12026077) and as a standalone play script in an  [edition](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22918553) which contains an essay on Childress by Pulitzer Prize dramatist Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins. Other plays by Childress can be found in the Childress anthology  [*Selected Plays*](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b21983999) which was edited by Kathy A. Perkins.
- [![Clyde's](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-06%2FClyde%2527s%2520TCG.jpg%3Fitok%3D-eJxLJ_4&w=256&q=75)](https://borrow.nypl.org/search/card?id=82b260e3-e8f3-5e16-805c-ce5cd00e45b5&entityType=FormatGroup)
	### Clyde's
	Pulitzer-Prize winning playwright Lynn Nottage made her Broadway debut as a playwright with the comedy *Clyde’s*. The production starred Uzo Aduba, Reza Salazar, Edmund Donovan, and Kara Young, and was one of the Emmy award winning actor Ron Cephas Jones’s (who died in 2023) last onstage performances. In the play “a truck stop sandwich shop offers its formerly incarcerated kitchen staff a shot at reclaiming their lives. Even as the shop's tough-as-nails owner tries to keep them under her thumb, the motley crew of line cooks are given purpose and permission to dream through their shared quest to create the perfect sandwich.”

- [![Skeleton Crew](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-06%2FSkeleton%2520Crew.jpg%3Fitok%3DKNOJdbiN&w=256&q=75)](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b21357762)
	### Skeleton Crew
	*Skeleton Crew* is one of the three plays in Dominique Morriseau’s "Detroit Trilogy" which focuses on Detroit’s African American community at three different moments in the 20th and early 21st century. Morriseau’s automobile factory set play was first produced Off-Broadway where it was  [filmed by TOFT](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b21087383) in 2016. Ruben Santiago-Hudson directed both the Off-Broadway and Broadway productions. A published version of the play can also be found in the  [volume](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b21643816) that has the two other plays (*Detroit* *'67* and  *Paradise Blue*) in the trilogy.

## Revivals

During the 2021–22 season, two plays by Black playwrights that had been previously produced on Broadway received revivals. These are the two that returned to Broadway:

- [![Slave Play](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-07%2FSlave%2520Play.jpg%3Fitok%3DfmONuyn6&w=256&q=75)](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22099110)
	### Slave Play
	Jeremy O. Harris's play about love, race, and historical trauma, was originally presented Off-Broadway in 2018. It was presented on Broadway the following year in 2019. The first Broadway production was [filmed by TOFT](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22073218) and the play was revived on Broadway in December 2021.
- [![for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-07%2Ffor%2520colored%2520girls.jpg%3Fitok%3DmjOzsQWJ&w=256&q=75)](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22147668)
	### for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf
	Ntozake Shange’s enduring choreopoem, a genre-breaking celebration of Black womanhood, received its first Broadway revival in 2022, decades after it debuted at the Booth Theater in September 1976. Since then, the play has been presented nationally and internationally. It has also been adapted for [public TV](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22175889) in the 1980s and as a  [feature film](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22190792) that was released in 2011. The 2022 revival was directed by Camille Brown and  [filmed by TOFT](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22804675).
	TOFT also filmed the [20th anniversary Off-Broadway revival](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b16104135) of  *for colored girls..*. in 1995 that was presented by the New York-based theater company New Federal Theatre (whose [archives](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b21320023) are held at the Schomburg Center). NYPL archivist Valerie Wingfield wrote a  [blog post](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2017/05/04/new-federal-theatre) about this storied company.
	The 2022 revival inspired Doug Reside to do a deep dive into the [New York Shakespeare Theatre Festival records](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b15059124) held at LPA where he tracked the journey of  *for colored girls...* using the archives and [wrote a blog post](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2022/05/06/for-colored-girls-who-have-considered-suicide-when-rainbow-enuf) about this beloved work.

## Finally...

- [![A Strange Loop](https://www.nypl.org/scout/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.nypl.org%2Fsites-drupal%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fmax_width_960%2Fpublic%2F2025-07%2FA%2520Strange%2520Loop.jpg%3Fitok%3DuWZlmneF&w=256&q=75)](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b22372712)
	### A Strange Loop
	This post wouldn't be complete without acknowledging the Broadway production of the musical *A Strange Loop* which premiered Off-Broadway in 2019 and won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 2020. African American artist Michael R. Jackson wrote the book, music, and songs for  *A Strange Loop*. The musical is described as a "blistering, momentous new musical \[which\] follows a young artist at war with a host of demons—not least of which, the punishing thoughts in his own head—in an attempt to capture and understand his own strange loop."  *A Strange Loop* was presented toward the end of the theater season and went on to win Tony Awards for Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical. [TOFT filmed](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b21963043) the Off-Broadway production for those who may've missed the Off-Broadway or Broadway runs.
