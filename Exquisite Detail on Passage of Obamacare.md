I’m a health policy guy so forgive what may seem picky, but it must have resonated with you since it is pull quote.

Obamacare was not passed by nuclear option, which is killing the filibuster. After Scott Brown elected, the conf committee bill that would unify the House and Senate version into one bill that had to pass both houses could be filibustered. 41 would beat 59 as is the essence of the Senate.

The Dems passed a reconciliation bill that cannot be filibustered. This greatly affected Obamacare b/c the Senate parliamentarian ruled out hundreds of provisions desired as unable to be included in a reconciliation bill. The Dems did not fire parliamentarian, but passed best they could get (reconciliation is supposed to focus on $ so policy changes and obvious drafting errors could not be changed). The family glitch, the CLASS provisions and on and on.

Reconciliation has been used about 25 times since budget act of 1974, for example, for 1982 tax cuts; 1993 Clinton tax plan; 2017 tax cut & that is what Rs are planning for tax cut extensions and Medicaid cuts (which is only way to make budget reconciliation instruction passed by House work).

Anyway, Dems compulsively followed norms and did not use nuclear option for Obamacare. It was amazing that Pelosi got House to stomach the Senate version, that included hundreds of Republican amendments from Senate Finance committee mark up even though they all voted no.

A pet peeve, from someone who teaches in a public policy school.

You are right, of course, I’m sure reconciliation is what the author meant and is how I read it. The term “nuclear option” does refer to the filibuster, and I stand corrected!

That being said, I covered the Obamacare passage at the time for Bill Moyers and disagree with your characterization that Dems compulsively followed norms. In my view the death of Ted Kennedy and the shock election of Scott Brown in the bluest of states should have ended that draft of Obamacare and the powers that be should have gone back to the drawing board for better-designed policy with more public support. Yes, the parliamentarian threw out a bunch of provisions, and Dems were annoyed about that, but exploiting reconciliation that’s supposed to be only about budget issues to ram through what was transparently not a budget bill was cynical and disingenuous abuse of the process — at the time I compared it to Caligula appointing his horse to the Senate — that went a long way toward destroying norms and encouraging the kind of ugly brass-knuckle politics we have today. The implications were troubling to the extreme and I consider it one of the great scandals of American political history. That’s why my eyes glided over the term “nuclear option” — I’d argue Dems’ abuse of reconciliation was a dramatic enough turning point to warrant the “nuclear” adjective.

Yeah I guess we do disagree on top line characterization. Especially the word ‘rammed’ through. The Senate Finance committee held the longest public mark in history. House Commerce, Ways and Means, and Budget each passed their own versions and it was merged into 1 (anyone remember the name of the 1 Republican who voted for that?). Obamacare was the most talked about public policy debate in history. I have no idea what second place is, but it aint close.

I decided to go back and see what I wrote then. This is an old, old blog that I am impressed still exists.

Here is what I wrote just before Obama had Repubs to white house for the ‘summit’ on a way forward Feb 22, 2010

Here is what I wrote the day before the vote in March, 2010

The deem it passed is more shaky than the reconciliation bill (I suspect every side in the Senate that ever lost a reconciliation bill thought it an overreach but I would read a book about every reconciliation bill to ever become law.). I had forgotten about Michele Bachmann thinking Speaker Pelosi said “Demon Pass”. My granddaddy would say Lorda mercy if he was still alive. I have enjoyed revisiting 15 years ago!

FWIW
Here's [where my head was](https://cobb.typepad.com/cobb/2010/03/bipartisan-my-ass.html) at in March of 2010

The only thing more frightening than watching a ship sink is not knowing how to swim. So I watch with sadness as we head towards a path of government control. I'm unsure exactly how to feel, and that is because I haven't subjected myself to the subjective opinions of those trying to justify and those trying to demonize. 

This past week, I was pleasantly surprised that the CBO declared the whole rats nest would be below a trillion. But then I can't really think of anything else to say with any clarity. On this matter, which I hope doesn't pass, here's what I believe. I believe that people like me who make good money and have a choice will avoid this like the plague, and that we will be taxed more for it. That we'll be resentful and pony up and grumble under out breath. That the same people who were extraordinarily overjoyed by the election of Obama will, in 12 months, realize that they've been sold yet another bill of goods and that it will be too late. 

I haven't felt much like this since the days of Constructive Engagement when I flipflopped on the matter. The reason, then as now, is that sometimes reform is so impossible that even the best intentions and the best laid plans don't merit support. And so, America thinking its way rationally out of the bankruptcy of Medicare and Medicaid and finally Social Security seems like such a distant possibility that it may just be better off if the whole thing goes broke. I'm not skeptical, I'm cynical. I'm shorting the US Government and the whole brainwashed electorate. 

Understand that I don't think by any respects that America is 'ungovernable'. It's just that the people in office have it so wrong and the public is so powerless that neglect seems to be the best option. That's where my head is at. As I said. Cynical. I'm so glad that I'm in the software business, but I can see even more why attorneys make out. It's astonishing how true that is. The American consensus is broken, and people just want to stay mad. Now is the time for courage, but I don't expect it. I expect civility to break down for a period. 

Next week, I'm going to be in the wealthy part of DC. And as usual, I will continue doing my consulting work on the IT systems at Fannie Mae. I won't expect to see bricks thrown or pickets. I will expect to see us high-paid consultants build stuff that only we understand because matters of accountability go towards form rather than what's simply right. What's simply right is the enemy of political agendas that are locked in conflict, and that's where we are today. Anybody with half a brain could answer the question of whether or not there will be Federally funded abortions under the new proposal. A first year law student could write the text unambiguously. Instead we have all sorts of power and obfuscating forces on two sides of no consensus wheeling and dealing so that both sides can bark out that their side has won. And the answer at the end of the day of whether or not the matter is true or not will be "it's complicated".

That's how everything is going to be because that's what the President wants. It's complicated, and it's expensive. And it's his doing. Reconciliation is the enemy of truth.
