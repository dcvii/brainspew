Every person everywhere experiences the consequences of immorality and foolishness. Each individual has their own levels of robustness and anti-fragility. 

I find it interesting that even the most dedicated ‘anti-racists’ have not found a reliable method of gauging racism. As any person who solves complex problems knows the most juvenile way of assessing the problem is (exists, doesn’t exist) and (accept, reject). This is where most finger-pointing discussions go today. 

The worst aspect of this juvenile assessment is the unquestioned presumption that where racism exists, it is categorically incapacitating. As if every African American were from planet Krypton and every instantiation of racism was pure kryptonite. 

So I will refer to this thing I wrote in 2018. And I want you to think about what is effective racism. In other words, how much racism does it take to defeat the spirit of an individual and cause them to give up hope in life and accept that they are indeed inferior and doomed to second-class citizenship. 

But I also want you to pay attention to the chart which measures offensiveness and inoffensiveness and hurtfulness to helpfulness, because we deal with racial thinking all of the time. 

As I was saying in ' Dumbing Down Racism ': The direction in the US is to make even more and more insults, slights, harassments and petty outrages to be included in 'racism'. This has taken the form of 'triggers' and 'microaggressions' whose remedies are politically correct speech and 'safe spaces'. The aim is to sensitize individuals to this and then come up with 'solutions'. These solutions will deliver attention, influence, money and votes to their originators who are the Multiculturalists. The redefinition of racism to ever more sensitive levels and calls for a 'national discussion' satisfies the fetishes of 'experts' who would rescue victims of this 'abuse'. 

So everything is racist. But is it six pounds of racism? So I've come up with a two dimensional chart that you are smart enough to figure out yourself. So there's that. Here's the other thing by the way, that Charlottesville thing was 6 months ago. Since then there have been about 50 ordinary murders per day in this great country of ours. 

So to answer your question directly, you can presume but not prove that every African American receives some amount of racist background radiation just from living in America, and occasionally they will receive a concentration of x-rays, and on rare occasions a fatal blast of gamma rays to the head. Some are shielded, some seem immune and never get cancer. Some never make it to puberty before they are permanently scarred and deformed. 

Analogies aside, there is a scientifically valid way of making a sound determination in the arena of mental health. Since I, and most of my family are upper middle class, we are availed to psychological services and can readily determine if we are imbalanced. 

I’ll add one more thing, which a good friend spoke to me about over Thai food and beers. The author Thomas Chatterton Williams spoke about ‘inheriting the wound’. That like in the movie ‘Crooklyn’ some black parents want their children to experience those injustices that cause and fuel black rage. They believe that the intense emotional power of black rage can be harnessed and channeled towards productive ends. I happen to think that to be foolishness as well, as if playing with dynamite is instructive to children. And so goes the one-dimensional thinking of Critical Race Theory which believes similarly that a baptism in the fire of racial rage will be the key to unlocking magical doors. 

Wishful thinking. 

So if anyone thinks that the answer lies somewhere in the valley of the rage of African Americans against the ionizing radiation of racist thought and practice, they have it all wrong. This is civilization. Calls to screaming primal emotion only create intellectual pollution. 

Then again, some of y’all loved Eldridge Cleaver and Patty Hearst.

Stubbled on your writings a few days ago. You do good. I doubt racism will ever cease to exist. I have seen it in cultures that have only shades of brown. When racism, as practiced in the US, is not a good fit, other divisions are substituted. Tribes, languages, cultures, handed-ness, hair color, an…

Although I don't always agree with you, I definitely appreciate your answers. You are a true intellectual. I work in non-profit, most of my work has been in basic needs charities. The job of a charity is to fill need. But, I have noticed that need is often redefined relative to the affluence of the c…

Patty Hearst was an heiress who was kidnapped by militant radicals. She changed her hair, her name and her ideology and became a gun-totin’ bad mamma jamma for the Symbionese Liberation Army. Helped rob a bank. You know, an ‘ally’ in the Struggle.
