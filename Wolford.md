## What is the status of Wolford v Lopez?

- District Court (2023): Plaintiffs Jason Wolford, Alison Wolford, Atom Kasprzycki, and the Hawaii Firearms Coalition filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, challenging specific provisions of Hawaii’s Act 52 as unconstitutional under the Second Amendment, citing New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (2022). The district court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) in part, which was later converted into a preliminary injunction. The injunction enjoined enforcement of Hawaii’s firearm restrictions in:
	- Banks and financial institutions, including adjacent parking areas.
	- Public beaches and parks, including adjacent parking areas.
	- Bars and restaurants serving alcohol, including adjacent parking areas.
	- The default rule prohibiting concealed carry on private property open to the public without express authorization (e.g., a “Guns Welcome” sign).The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits for these provisions under Bruen ’s text-and-history test, which requires firearm regulations to be consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.
- - Hawaii’s restrictions on carrying firearms in modern parks and beaches were constitutional, as these locations differ from public spaces at the Founding (e.g., Boston Common, used for grazing and military exercises, not recreation). The court relied on post-Reconstruction laws (mid- to late-19th century) to establish a historical tradition of regulating firearms in “modern” public spaces.
	- The private property default rule (prohibiting concealed carry without express permission) was upheld, with the panel citing a limited historical record of regulations like an anti-poaching ordinance and a discriminatory Black Code, though these were criticized as outliers.
	- The court found that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their challenges to bans in bars, restaurants, and banks, citing historical analogues for regulating firearms in sensitive or high-risk locations.
- En Banc Petition (January 2025): The plaintiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, which was denied on January 15, 2025. Eight judges dissented, with Judges Collins and VanDyke arguing that the panel’s decision contradicted Bruen by:
	- Relying on post-Reconstruction laws rather than Founding-era precedents, contrary to Bruen ’s focus on 1791 (when the Second Amendment was ratified) or 1868 (when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified).
	- Upholding Hawaii’s private property default rule without sufficient historical analogues, creating a “novel” restriction that effectively bans public carry in many settings.
	- Allowing overly broad “sensitive places” designations beyond the limited examples in Bruen (e.g., schools, courthouses, polling places).The plaintiffs’ motion to stay the mandate was granted on January 16, 2025, preserving the status quo pending further appeals.

Current Status

- Supreme Court Petition (2025): The plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of two key issues:
	1. Whether the Ninth Circuit erred in upholding Hawaii’s private property default rule, which presumptively prohibits concealed carry on private property open to the public without express permission.
	2. Whether the Ninth Circuit erred by relying on post-Reconstruction and later laws to apply Bruen ’s text, history, and tradition test, rather than focusing on Founding-era or 1868 precedents.The petition is supported by a significant amicus curiae brief from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), filed on May 1, 2025, urging the Supreme Court to grant certiorari. The DOJ argues that:
	- Hawaii’s private property default rule inverts the historical presumption that individuals could carry firearms on private property unless prohibited by the owner.
	- The rule effectively nullifies the Second Amendment right to carry for self-defense, as it requires affirmative permission (e.g., a sign) in places like restaurants, stores, or parking lots.
	- The Ninth Circuit’s reliance on sparse and questionable historical analogues (e.g., a Black Code) fails Bruen ’s test, and the decision creates a circuit split with other courts interpreting Bruen more strictly.Additionally, 26 states and other groups (e.g., Firearms Policy Coalition) have filed amicus briefs supporting the petition, highlighting the case’s national significance.
- Public and Legal Commentary: Posts on X reflect strong support among Second Amendment advocates for the Supreme Court to take up Wolford v. Lopez, viewing Hawaii’s law as an overreach that undermines Bruen. The DOJ’s pro-Second Amendment stance has been noted as a rare and significant development.
- Judicial Criticism: The Ninth Circuit’s ruling has been criticized for its broad interpretation of “sensitive places” and reliance on post-1868 laws, which some judges and commentators argue deviates from Bruen ’s historical focus. The dissents in the en banc denial underscore a perceived circuit split and the need for Supreme Court clarification.
- Broader Implications: The case is seen as a critical test of Bruen ’s application, particularly regarding where firearms can be carried and how courts should evaluate historical analogues. A Supreme Court ruling could resolve inconsistencies in lower court interpretations and address the scope of “sensitive places” and private property regulations.
