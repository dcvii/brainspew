Artificial intelligence’s potential to dissolve native intelligence has become a major concern among scholars and educators. At UC Berkeley, where I am a Ph.D. candidate and teaching assistant, instructors and students have landed on ad hoc, oft-dubious solutions to the quandaries raised by the advent of ChatGPT. A fellow TA warned his students that if he suspected essays had been written with AI he would use AI to grade them. A mentor has doubled down on his use of blue-book exams to ensure that undergraduates are absorbing the material. A former student assured me she usually asks ChatGPT to help her generate essay outlines—only sometimes requesting whole paragraphs. AI’s ability to displace intellectual endeavor, turning the diligent student into a latter-day John Henry, can no longer be dismissed out of hand. A recent [study](https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/___.YXAzOnRhYmxldDphOm86OGQxODYwZWU3YzFlOWIyNGIzZWUxNTE1N2I3M2ExMWI6Njo1NDc2OjAzYjhjY2QzYWEyMjAzY2M0Y2YxMGNlNmJiZTBmNzkzODllNWFhMjNiZDRjYmI2MDUzYTM3NTU2MDhjNmE4NjA6cDpUOk4) from MIT has vindicated this thesis, showing a marked decline in cognitive function and originality among those students heavily dependent on ChatGPT, et al.

Despite grounds for pessimism, academics ought not rend their garments just yet. This is particularly true for those of us in Jewish studies. If employed in a responsible manner, generative intelligence portends a vast expansion of the scope and scale of our research.

Jewish studies’ greatest methodological constraint arises from consisting mainly of Hebrew- and English-native speakers. World Jewry’s bipolar concentration in the United States and Israel contrasts with—and hamstrings our study of—Jews’ diasporic past. Other than Hebrew, Ladino, Judeo-Arabic, and Yiddish, the corpus of the Cairo Genizah includes significant materials in Greek, Latin, and Syriac. Rashi, using Hebrew characters, provided us with some of the oldest extant examples of *langue d’oïl*. Emanuel Ringelblum’s magisterial dissertation on the history of the Jews of Warsaw is only available in complete form in Polish.

The history of the Jewish people has unfolded in a multiplicity of tongues, both Jewish and non-Jewish. Meanwhile, very few U.S.-based scholars have even partial facility in more than two or three languages. After the destruction of European Jewry in the Holocaust and the expulsion of Middle Eastern Jewry after the founding of Israel, few of us possess adequate mastery of Yiddish, Ladino, Polish, Hungarian, Arabic, Berber or Romanian to access the rich store of Jewish voices and texts from these lands and tongues.

The discipline’s research agenda is thus distorted by our lack of broad literacy in other tongues. Some areas and periods frequently receive more or less attention for no other reason than the prevailing lack of language skills among U.S.-born students. Scholars able to do work in “hard” languages have an advantage over the competition. “He has got the show all to himself,” a professor once exclaimed about someone researching Budapest’s Jewish community. “Who else could read Hungarian?”

The shaping influence of language barriers holds true in studies of Eastern European Jewry, especially when these demand serious engagement with Slavic languages. Among younger generations, most who study Eastern Europe’s Jews—a rather limited number given that Polish Jewry was the epicenter of world Jewish life for four centuries—were born in the former Eastern Bloc. Even then, most have facility with Russian but not Polish.

By the same token, Anglo, French, and German communities draw notice disproportionate to their numbers—and yes, importance (and I say that as a student of French Jewish history). This can be attributed in part to the development of Jewish studies—the German Jews who founded the field in the 19th century and the American Jews who won for it a place in postwar academia no doubt placed greater emphasis on their own backgrounds. France, as the laboratory for emancipation and the home of Europe’s largest postwar Jewish community, also understandably attracts much attention. Just as much of this structural deficit and distortion, however, owes to sheer linguistic poverty—French and German are much easier to acquire than Farsi or Czech.

American Jewry’s linguistic deficit is more serious than our peers in Israel—English’s global hegemony grants them entrée to Anglo scholarship and modern Hebrew provides an easier entry point to Yiddish, Judeo-Arabic, and biblical/rabbinic/medieval Hebrew. American Jewish assimilation—which layers on top of a larger national monolingualism—has precluded serious mastery of Hebrew or Yiddish for most of us reared outside of Orthodox communities. Having to read I.L. Peretz or S.Y. Agnon in translation hurts for any serious reader of Jewish literature. The problem acquires more urgency for those who want to study American Jewish immigration history or the rise of the Hebrew novel.

Generative AI’s translation abilities, outrunning their predecessors by a country mile, can open doors to the diasporic past for scholars of our bipolar present. ChatGPT and DeepL resemble in nothing the lumbering Google Translate of the aughts. These tools produce text attuned to idiomatic speech, tone, and irony. The use of DeepL among magazines and publications that translate their content into multiple languages is a fait accompli. *Le Monde* [advertises](https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.lemonde.fr/le-monde-et-vous/article/2022/04/07/welcome-to-le-monde-in-english_6121029_6065879.html___.YXAzOnRhYmxldDphOm86OGQxODYwZWU3YzFlOWIyNGIzZWUxNTE1N2I3M2ExMWI6NjplNDcxOjIyN2FhOGU1ZDY4ZmU3ZTUxZDgxNDk2MzhiMzNjZWZmMWEwOWQ4MzhmNzNiMTBiYjM3NzA3NTljOTVlNTM1OTA6cDpUOk4) on its website that its English edition is the product of “two American translation agencies with the aid of AI tool.”

AI translations can help us bust out of our own narrow linguistic enclaves, spurring comparative studies and a rebalancing of the discipline’s temporal and geographic map. This path is, of course, strewn with dangers. Translation is a form of interpretation—the scholar cannot outsource this interpretive work to an AI agent with a serene conscience. The ubiquity of automated translation services might broaden access to sources in “obscure” languages while flattening possible readings and absolving scholars of the (essential!) *corvée* of language learning. AI translation permits us to discover and extract information from sources in foreign languages, comprehend the gist of a text and the basic arguments within, and overcome initiation obstacles at the beginner level in a language. These tools ought not to be used to produce exact quotations or substitute for the close reading of literary criticism. In the latter case, the scholar should consult—and credit—a peer who is a competent user of the original language.

The linguistic deficit dovetails with another problem whose resolution must come from within us, not from machines: the twin plagues of moralism and presentism that are sadly pervasive within our discipline. Spurning Herder’s call to “feel” our way into other cultures through empathy and imagination, too many Jewish studies scholars and students adopt the posture of sanctimonious poobah. The confines of the premodern *kehillah* are deplored as merely constraining, and not also protective. Jewish women’s embrace—and intensification—of the rules of *niddah* in the Middle Ages is viewed as “patriarchal,” and as “internalized” oppression. Rhineland Jewry’s propensity for martyrdom amid the pogroms of the crusades elicits aversion among those for whom belief does not matter.

Assuming imaginative and empathetic engagement with traditional beliefs and communal forms, artificial intelligence might also help us bridge another gaping divide in Jewish scholarship: the one separating the university and the *beit midrash*. Ethan Katz, Sergey Dolgopolski, and Elisha Ancselovits [aver](https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.routledge.com/When-Jews-Argue-Between-the-University-and-the-Beit-Midrash/Katz-Dolgopolski-Ancselovits/p/book/9781032427416?srsltid=AfmBOooxR46-sdJWf2XHdQLA-DL0HMkhA_qtct_IyxGTPLo0Id-SGnvf___.YXAzOnRhYmxldDphOm86OGQxODYwZWU3YzFlOWIyNGIzZWUxNTE1N2I3M2ExMWI6Njo3N2Y1OjhkMDVhMmY1MDdiMzIxNDc1NTRiNTBkMmJjZmVjYWI5ZmE4YWM2NWQwNzkyNDM2OGI4MDE4NzlmYzQ5YmIxNTI6cDpUOk4) in a recent volume that Jewish studies frequently neglects traditional religious sources, e.g., Talmud, responsa, midrash, as well as their methods of reading and understanding texts. Dominated by lay academics rather than Torah scholars, Jewish studies (“the faith of fallen Jews,” in historian Yosef Yerushalmi’s felicitous phrase) reflects a secular bias in its theory and methods. Because many in Jewish studies find the traditional world so strange and remote, we might underestimate the importance of rabbinical opinions, *musar* literature, or *batei din* in shaping the Jewish past. Katz (who for disclosure’s sake is my dissertation adviser) has tried to address this by organizing graduate seminars in which students are encouraged to engage in *chevruta*, delve deeper into premodern religious literature, and familiarize themselves with digital tools, i.e., Sefaria, that can help us access this corpus.

AI might well be able to bring some facets of the traditional world—its texts and modes of reading and understanding—right to one’s computer screen. Moshe Koppel, a computer scientist at Bar-Ilan University and the founder of the Dicta laboratory, which has been training large language models on rabbinical literature and other religious texts, [posits](https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/mosaicmagazine.com/essay/politics-current-affairs/2024/03/what-artificial-intelligence-has-in-store-for-judaism/___.YXAzOnRhYmxldDphOm86OGQxODYwZWU3YzFlOWIyNGIzZWUxNTE1N2I3M2ExMWI6Njo1MmEyOmYyMmJjZGY3ODMyNzM0NjQ3MDg5M2VhMWI0MDE5Mzg1ZTM4YmY5NmIwZTYwYzExOWM2MWZiMjMzODczYzI0YjI6cDpUOk4) that AI could speed the process of digitizing, correcting (for scribal error, etc.), and annotating the entire corpus for online use. In a more speculative vein, he even ventures that an artificial intelligence module might be able to deliberate on questions of Jewish law, dispensing answers in lieu of the usual authorities.

The advent of a responsa bot, Koppel concedes, would precipitate a host of epistemic and ethical conundrums. He ventures nonetheless that the Jewish world is well-positioned to weather the generative intelligence revolution because of our embodied and tech-leery tradition, pointing to the institution of the *beit midrash* and the Sabbath.

There is no reason, however, that the *beit midrash* could not be simulated via an AI module. I hesitate to make such a suggestion when social contact is already in retreat, and ChatGPT has for too many supplanted real-world connection. I must admit, however, that the idea of exchanging with an electronic *chevruta* excites me. Such a text-study partner could be trained to imitate various schools of Jewish thought and interpretation—the module might ventriloquize a student at the Volozhin Yeshiva, or a Tosafist, or Rav Moshe Feinstein. The electronic *chevruta* could pretend to be a Reform rationalist or a Haredi mystic. For the scholar of Jewish studies, such an exercise could expand our epistemic frontiers and historical imagination. Due to one’s sex, level of religious observance, or even social anxiety, the *beit midrash* can be a forbidding place. Text study with the virtual *chevruta* could pry open an alien world.

The usual caveats ought to add a note of caution. AI modules have frequently replaced our learning and social contacts with pap, rather than enhancing and enabling deeper and more meaningful experiences. The *beit midrash* —the students bowed and bent over their books, locked in sometimes fierce dialogue, surrounded by a self-contained world of learning and ritual—cannot be transported to one’s MacBook Pro. I mused about a virtual *beit midrash* to a prominent Talmudist, who reacted with a mix of incredulity and indignation. He asked how one could ever substitute the solitary world of a person before his screen for this environment. He also questioned how an AI agent could reproduce the ambiguity and equivocation of Talmudic discourse: “The whole point in text study or rabbinical discourse is that there is no *one* right answer. How could some digital contraption even grapple with that?”

My interlocutor is surely correct: The gulf between the university and the *beit midrash* cannot be closed through online abracadabra. But in the right hands, the *chevruta* GPT could facilitate the intellectual play, intercultural border-crossing, and epistemic openness that can only improve our scholarship. Engagement across the secular-religious divide could start through such a tool, but not end there—doing text study at a real *beit midrash* would still be the ideal.

The future of the Jews and AI remains open and indeterminate, yet Jewish history teaches us not to run from tomorrow. Our ancestors, who incorporated outside practices and technological advances into the edifice of Judaism, were guided by history and tradition—but they were not fearful or ignorant people. Artificial intelligence cannot be ignored, either in academia or the broader Jewish world. Jewish studies can and must summon our *mesorah* ’s spirit of ingenuity and adaptation.
