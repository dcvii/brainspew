### How You Can Tell He Does Not Care About An Issue

*Oops—the Substack Live with AK will have to be rescheduled for later in the week. Apologies!*

Hi All,

One of the reasons I have been consistent over the past year (and I hope consistently right) in arguing that Trump would never break with Putin, would cut aid to Ukraine, would basically protect the Russians was because of what I will call the Trump “tell”. For those of you who might not know the term, a [“tell” is some unconscious physical signal](http://any%20physical,%20verbal,%20or%20behavioral%20cue%20exhibited%20by%20a%20player%20during%20a%20game,%20inadvertently%20revealing%20information%20about%20the%20strength%20of%20their%20hand./) that a poker player gives off when they are bluffing or have a good hand. A “tell” can be as simple as a tapping of the finger when bluffing or a widening of the eyes when holding weak cards. Regardless it is a consistent and discernible tendency to repeat something when faced with the same situation—which can indicate to others the true state of affairs.

Donald Trump has one great tell that an issue really does not matter to him.
