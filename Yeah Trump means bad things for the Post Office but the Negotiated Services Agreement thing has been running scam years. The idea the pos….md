1\. Yeah Trump means bad things for the Post Office but the Negotiated Services Agreement thing has been running scam years. The idea the post office just has to deliver for Amazon at subsidized prices is ridiculous. Raise the prices. [washingtonpost.com/business/2020/…](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/14/trump-postal-service-package-rates/)

2\. In 2019 the Post Office stopped

from ripping them off with one of these negotiated service agreements.

's stock fell by 50%+. Trump is right, the Post Office needs to stop being a sucker. [marketwatch.com/story/stampsco…](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stampscom-is-breaking-up-with-the-us-postal-service-and-its-stock-is-down-nearly-50-2019-02-21)

3\. Obama didn't bother to appoint people to run the post office. And the post office did little hiring of full time staff under Obama, preferring consultants.

4\. A coherent approach to the post office would be to have it do what Taiwan's postal service is doing, which is turn it into a delivery vehicle for masks and medical supplies during the pandemic. That's called governing. Instead it's just 'do you like the post office or not?'

5\. Trump's choices around the post office will be catastrophic, but that doesn't mean he's wrong about Amazon's exploitation of the post office. And it doesn't excuse the total lack of vision and neglect by Dems.
