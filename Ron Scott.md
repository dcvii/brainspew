_________________________________________

Please let me preface this long bio with a hint of self awareness. I'm rereading some of my content here and I hear the voice of a somewhat embittered aging bloke. --¬†but you know it's honesty.

I didn't like so many powerful men around 1980 doubting my character about not wanting to enter exclusive inward turned old Harvard early. The scarce and fascinating few highly placed ladies available to mentor were often only able to muster their father's networks though I was brought to seven sisters campuses and a few state houses and guided. üòä

Thus I don't go in for¬†mere brand purchase¬†in university matching. It was donor money and faculty effort that built most every stateside private higher educational institution and the fact must be understood in order to assure their continued success.

Back to the program üòÅ:

I was welcomed back to the University of Cambridge in 1985 after a consulting internship with IBM Fellows (I'd spent time at Cavendish lab as a prodigy.)

It was Sir James Mirrlees ‚Äî who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for research on the economic theory of incentives when information is incomplete or asymmetric who was my primary thought collaborator and advocate within Trinity College Cambridge.

Sir James was Knighted in 1997, was a Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge and Emeritus Professor of Political Economy there. Sir James introduced me as a Trinity Fellow-in-Waiting in 1985 after my IBM sustainability consultations.

I'd been recommended to Sir James by American universities. I was a prodigy of Ambassador Kingman Brewster and co-witnessed his formal registration to Queen Elizabeth Ii's Court of St. James. I assisted the former Yale President in that diplomacy role from Merton Oxford/Yale Law School.

At Harvard I'd been a longtime prodigy/consultant in the Business School programs introducing a Board desired populist bent and a rare though growing 1970s HBS minority presence. I conducted independent research in history and law spanning decades -- especially at Yale and also at Oxbridge.

My academic beginning was being awarded an internal prodigy degree (through an arrangement by President Goheen) in Physics summa cum laude from Princeton University at 13 years of age. I had involvement with PIAS and gave a talk in theoretical physics as part of my early studies. This early work caused Harvard to court me as a future leader there. I audited broadly and was offered special programs at the United States Naval Academy. I began my career as a pilot/assistant navy corpsman.

I finished Harvard Med in my teen years, had neonatal brain surgery admitting privileges at Mass Gen at 18 due to a shortened residency and assisted US Senator Bill Frist, MD (the later Senate Majority Leader) in cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins. I was also an advocate for enhanced health care access in greater Boston.

I served as Private Secretary to king Charles [then PoW & Duke of Rothesay], Advised queen Elizabeth II as Interim Private Secretary, held Household Leadership roles within Buckingham Palace, as Bill Browns Officer, consultated to UK Parliamentary leaders, to diplomats worldwide, and privided university and philanthropic consulting. I held professorships at Harvard, Stanford and Oxbridge including the University of Cambridge Bass Professorship in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology as Applied to Medicine once I finished Harvard, University of Oxford Examiner at Codrington and Interim Stanford Provost.

I'm using Quora to recycle the mentoring I enjoyed. I'd also like to share that I released stress in my college years through sport: ATP tennis, University of Cambridge rowing, in backup quarterback roles at Stanford and Navy and even as an NFL pre season kicking team specialist. I was successful in getting pro scouts fired. üòÅ

These athletic activities didn't serve so much to round me out as to shift my mind toward group training, uplift, trust and to build personal leadership skills. Give it a try! [Working hard and being talented may prove insufficient to reaching one's goals. When people want to refer you they may want you back. That was the story of my development and rise: earning respect and referrals and in time great opportunities within my network to rejoin an organization.. üòÅ]

[I've been asked questions about my¬†claimed¬†üôÉracing/piloting career. I'm a small name. In 1980s Germany I'm told there were no other drivers from the United States quite fluent in German including those of German-American heritage. The proficiency helped me attract mentors and with making friends in the garage as well as within motorsport more broadly.

1980s McLaren knew of my youth training taken with Aston Martin before later joining training with Mercedes where I never raced. I was brought into the McLaren test garage just as the F1 was being introduced. I spoke Italian, Spanish and a bit of Portuguese which Mr. Senna appreciated as his English was not as strong as he would have liked. I won patents for aerodynamics in the UK.

I honestly viewed myself as last man at McLaren for a while but the wrenchers liked my attitude. I stuck around long enough to get called to reserve upon occasion with no points earned and no particular distinction. In my 30s I remained available even with military/diplomatic responsibilities.

I was well thought of enough to be invited to help lead the revival of an old name: Sauber. I became Team Head after piloting car two. I had taken a few points at Williams and was most proud to be involved with Sauber. History of pre wide internet minor pilots is difficult to research. Even modern Williams new owners in 2022 seem to know nothing of my reserve/test time there (This concealment of my activities was required by SOCOM and Joint Services. )

I¬†have no need to brag about this hard won F1 background. The moden under 35 doubters simply were not present. I'm forgotten and content with that however I'll share and long retired people at the Scuderia in Maranello and perhaps a stateside old timer with Gnassi will remember.

Most pilots in the 1980s benefited from a blending of ability, intense focus, nerve¬†and money connections. The stars naturally didn't need any help. The mid-pack drivers are of whom I speak. I'm not a significant figure of late century F1 -- ask the top long retired pilots at the old firms: Scott,¬†The Racing Professor¬†has supplied podium bubbly. Lol.]

I believe in cross cultural understanding and earned friendship. Don't force it but do try to be open. By the content and tenor of a good many Quora questions too many folks are preparing for future with little reading in other cultures. What can develop as a result is contentment with the comfortable/familiar and an inability or unwillingness to interact and function with myriad peoples --¬†and no, promoting bosses and T15 universities do not value such habits.

The world is complex but need not be so interpersonally -- I say seek understanding. You will become a better hire and a better manager.

Cheers

A Few Inspirational Historical Fgures of My Prodigy Youth

Major Martin Delany
- Civil War field grade army officer who greatly impressed President Lincoln
- One of three n_groes enrolled at Harvard Med in 1850 ‚Äî the first ever!
- I lectured on Major Delaney at Harvard and at service academies.

William F Buckley Jr.
- A Yale thinker/pundit who I was assured I'd disdain in my Y resident prodigy introductions who liked what he was hearing about me and invited me to visit his office for morning tea. We'd argue in a gentlemanly manner about myriad topics and chat about debate ideas for competitions.¬†I learned from intellectual interaction with Bill that differences within one's circle did not necessarily preclude friendship ‚Äî a valuable life lesson taken forward. I was an unusual middle 1970s prodigy meeting state and national leaders.

I was firmly but intelligently critical of Governor Ron Reagan over his handling of multicultural protesters in Berkeley California and yet he saw something unique in this kid. I was the prodigy of Senator GHW Bush and I was brought into 1970s Congressional deliberations just to observe like Senator's kids.

Bill Buckley was impressed with this and we all shared ideas. Physical violence/outward anger in protest doesn't serve as a foundation for effective or persuasive communication. Enlightened Republicans knew that my race and thought groups were demanding some manner of openness from the generally closed mid-century WASP inner power sanctum.

I was invited to bring people and new ideas toward education, health and military solutions for California, Connecticut and for our country and was asked by George and Barbara Bush to support and one day join their party in an era in which republican elected officials of color were few in new England (I was a Yale Law School resident prodigy by 1974 also was living with the Bush family. ) At age 18 I officially made the switch from the democratic party on the floor of the US Senate.

[I did wonder if Ron Reagan was the right sort of political associate to have. He'd identified me I didn't choose him. He listened to me and my lady/multicultural peers and got back to us on expectations and wishes. Politics involves disappointment and Ron and Nancy came to appreciate that I had a sense of national level tectonic politics. Little can change quickly. I'm honored to have been involved in several white houses and accepted that a black liberal republican was widely viewed as an oxymoron to be marginalized. A dedicated and admiring mentor had been Nelson Rockefeller thus I come by that honestly. üòÅ]

I never had interest in reaching Bill's otherworldly level of verbal resourcefulness as I preferred developing German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese in my youth. I did manage to occasionally mystify and impress the old master in debate (Bill enjoyed practicing foreign language phrases with this Y student.) When he launched his television show¬†Firing Line¬†I went from sometime academic assistant (I'd moved over to Princeton University) to a contributor in production for the show via telephone.

Toward his later years his contemporaries called me the only one who could have softened the hero of the conservative movement. Indeed Bill's mind opened to new possibilities and to fresh intercultural social landscapes. He'd visit to speak at Ivy Club, Princeton which curtailed the ancient Princeton/Yale rivalry. I gave the introductions and even the President of Princeton University might appear. Bill and I often dined in the more famous Chinatowns of the 1970s/80s United States. He brought the plastic and I the afro. üòÅ

I highly value the flattened interaction possible online. We had quite the opposite in mid-century and in the 1970s until we began knowing each other as university students, careerists and neighbors. I put myself out there and invite comment.

I predate DEI. I always refuse late-century Affirmative Action review for my advantage. I successfully fought inclusion battles not to quotas but to interviews and for linguists who often were biracial. That was a different era.¬†Apologies but I don't engage the modern DEI debate. I did my work in the 90 to 95 percent white professor/officer/middle manager era.

I only name dropped in the hopes of catching your attention. I was also mouthy in 1975 when called m at Harvard and Yale. To your conclusion sir the elected leaders in democracies are properly the key decision makers with the executive governing body. FDR could akmost wish things done in his time. Indeed nuclear plants have a complex regulatory framework to pass through. Green looks both publicly funded and a hot venture area. Innumerable actors are on joining.

My path to the University of Oxford is a Harvard scholar-athlete story:

- I met Chancellor prince Philip through Cavendish prodigy mentorings. He liked my interest in the UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth. I was training in Alpine downhill and liked Merton Oxford and Balliol Oxford.
- On summer returns to the Grenadier Guard I took Oxford classes. I flew helos and knew Jaguar Aston peole. I'd studied physics at Princeton and joined AM youth development.
- After time completing Yale Law research i was asked by the Palace to conduct some diplomacy requiring study at Merton. After an Mphil and later did a DPhil. I researched taught at the University of Tokyo and the University of Cape Town Law School. I was a linguist fluent in German, Italian and Japanese though not concurrently. I helped the vice Chancellor with the faculties. I was asked to fill in as Examiner by the Chancellor, faculty Representatives and by queen Elizabeth II [I was Westminister and SOCOM and I'm not listed online.]
- I consulted to the old EEC and observed ASEAN.¬†That is what was asked of me. I was put up for professorships by queen Elizabeth II. I'd begun by sitting in on her weekly audiences with Maggie Thatcher. Being identified early helps.

The UK is different. Once identified with success one's name may be called again and again. In United States private universities I was a disgruntled voice against elitism, class based admission and snobbery. Big names at these schools agreed.¬†We freshened several.

I am a mere possibity invested in by Duke prince Philip, GHW Bush before he ran for Senate and so many others. In lacking interest in old West Point, old USNA and old Harvard I found myself tasked with board reform and later with board leadership.

I agreed to lonely years as a change leader.

Best,

A veteran officer
