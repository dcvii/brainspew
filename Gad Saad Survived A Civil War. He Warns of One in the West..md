In the 1940s, there were around 20,000 Jews still living in Lebanon. Just 20 years later, in the span of one generation, that number dropped to around 3,000. Gad Saad is among those statistics—born in Lebanon in 1964 into one of the last Jewish families to remain in the country.

But the nation that was once called the Paris of the Middle East began to turn when he was a child. He remembers being at school one day when a fellow student told the class he wanted to be a Jew killer when he grew up. The rest of the kids laughed. By 1975, Lebanon had descended into a brutal civil war, and Gad remembers death awaiting him every millisecond of the day. He spent his childhood years mindful of which streets had snipers when he went outside to play. But even then his family thought, *This will pass*. That is until someone showed up at their home to kill them—at which point the Saad family fled to rebuild their life in Canada. Gad went on to become a professor of marketing and evolutionary behavioral sciences at Concordia University in Montreal.

Many of us in Western democracies find ourselves saying the exact same things: This will pass over, everything will be fine. We say that even as Hamas flags and “I love Hezbollah” posters fly in cosmopolitan capitals across the West. I’ve been asking myself a lot over the past year: How worried should we be? Am I being hysterical? And is there a way to roll back this anti-civilizational impulse that has been let loose?

Those are just some of the questions I put to Gad Saad in our conversation. Gad says that witnessing the [Lebanese Civil War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Lebanese-Civil-War) gave him a crash course in the extremes of identity politics, tribalism, and illiberalism. And he says that immigrants like himself, who have lived without the virtues of the West—virtues like freedom of speech and thought, reason and liberalism—uniquely understand what’s at stake now in Western cultural and political life.

If you’re on X, I suspect you know Gad’s name. Unlike most professors, he has a and a knack for satire, so much so that Elon Musk seems to be one of his biggest fans. He has become one of the most insightful and provocative thinkers on the risks of mob rule and extremism on the left.

Meanwhile, he is now having second thoughts about the university where he has worked for the past 30 years. That’s because Concordia is now widely regarded as one of the most antisemitic universities in North America. As a result, Gad is currently a visiting professor and global ambassador at Northwood University in Michigan, and he says he can’t face returning to Concordia and maybe even Canada, given the antisemitism that’s run rampant there. All of this, he argues, constitutes another war, different but related to the one he witnessed in Lebanon as a child. This one is a war on logic, science, common sense, and reality, here in the West.

These are ideas he explains in [his important book](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781684512294), *The Parasitic Mind: How Infectious Ideas Are Killing Common Sense.* In our wide-ranging conversation, I asked Gad where these parasitic ideas came from and why they’re encouraged in the West. And importantly, I ask if these trends are reversible.

***On the ever-present threat of violence in Lebanon and his family’s decision to flee:***

**Bari Weiss**: I wonder if you could take us back in time to the 1960s, to Lebanon before the war. You’re one of the last of a very small Jewish community living there. Take us back to the world you were born into.

**Gad Saad**: So I was born in 1964. We were steadfastly, doggedly refusing to leave Lebanon, despite the fact that, yes, you’re right, that there was a time when Lebanon was considered progressive, certainly by Middle Eastern standards. But much of my extended family had read the writing on the wall and had left earlier, prior to the civil war, many of whom left for Israel. And one maternal aunt left for Montreal. That’s one of the reasons why we ended up immigrating to Canada. Bit by bit, each of my siblings had left Lebanon, but I remained because I was a young kid.

And so, just to give your audience a feel of what it was like growing up Jewish in Lebanon: When I was a child, I was in a class where the teacher asked us to get up and tell what we’d like to be when we grew up. And so you get the typical professions. “I’d like to be a doctor. I’d like to be a police officer. I’d like to be a soccer player.” And one kid, who is a kid that knew that I was Jewish, got up and said, “When I grow up, I want to be a Jew killer,” to raucous applause and laughter. And that’s just the typical thing that you would see in the Middle East.

**BW**: You’re 10 or 11 years old, the war breaks out, and, of course, your family is forced to flee. Was there a particular moment that you remember? Knowing that we were going to have to get out of here to save our lives?

**GS**: There are many, many such moments, because death awaited you at every millisecond of the day. For example, my parents would tell me, “You can go out and play outside, but don’t pass this particular line, because that would open you up to the eyesight of the snipers that are on this building.” And I’m actually getting goosebumps saying this.

***Why Lebanon’s identity politics should be a warning to America:***

**BW**: For the listener who is only paying attention to Lebanon now because it’s in the news, can you briefly explain to us the nature of the civil war so that people don’t have to go running to Wikipedia, which is now overtaken by propagandists?

**GS**:So the Lebanese Civil War was from 1975 to 1990, officially. And during that time there are different estimates. But the most common estimate that I’ve seen is that roughly 150,000 people were killed. Now, in a country of, say, 3 million people, that gives you a sense that it’s pretty sizable. Now, different people will argue that, no, it was a political war. It wasn’t. The reality is that it had a clear religious timbre to it. There were several Christian militias that were fighting several Muslim militias. Now, the Muslim militias, when they’re not fighting against the Christians, could turn the guns against each other and fight one another. So it was complete chaos. The reality is that everything in Lebanon is viewed through the prism of religion. Who could be prime minister or who could be president? How many seats you get in the parliament is all based on your religion.

**BW:** I want you to explain the connection between the ideology that you began to encounter in the mid-1970s in Lebanon and the identity politics that has subsumed so much of our culture here in the West.

**GS**: Well, Lebanon is the perfect exemplar of what happens when identity politics are taken to their nefarious limits. Everything is viewed through the lens of which religion you belong to. So it really is identity politics on steroids. And so I see certain political movements, whether it be in the United States or in Canada or in the West in general, that are very much wedded to that idea. One of the parasitic ideas that I speak about in the book is precisely linked, as you said, to identity politics. And I tell people, hey, watch out, because if you want that perfect example of what identity politics is in terms of how you organize society, Lebanon is the place. Syria is the place. Iraq is the place. Rwanda is the place. So it’s never a good idea when people who live under a supposedly unified nation are more tied to whatever identity marker first defines them more so than the country. What made the United States great is that I could be anything, but nothing was superseded by my commitment to American values. Once you erase that, once you eradicate that foundational value, you’re going to run into problems. It might take 100 years, it might take 500 years, but you will get the exact same final outcome.

***On brain worms and political pathology:***

**BW**: So if we were having this conversation, let’s say, 50 years ago, there are a lot of things that would have seemed completely benign to anyone at that time living in North America. The idea that men and women are different. The idea that capitalism is better than communism; the idea that demanding equality of outcome will lead to tyranny. I could list 10 other things. All of those commonsensical statements have now become, if not dangerous to talk about, absolutely provocative. And I think the question a lot of people have is how did that happen? And your answer is captured in *The Parasitic Mind.* For the sake of this conversation, can you explain what the parasitic mind is, what you’re describing?

**GS**: I used the term *parasitic*, rather than, say, *woke mind virus* or *mimetic* because there is something unique about parasitic rapture. Now, let me step back and give you the background to how I developed that framework. In the animal kingdom, there is a study of parasitology. Parasitology is the interaction between a host and a parasite in many different ways. So, for example, a tapeworm is a parasite that goes into your intestinal tract. A neural parasite wants to get to your brain. Literally, a brain worm. I argue in this book that human beings can also be parasitized by actual physical brain worms. For example, *Toxoplasma gondii* is one such example. But human beings, regrettably, can also be parasitized by a second class of brain worms. Those are called ideological brain worms. I call them parasitic ideas or idea pathogens. For the rest of the book, I explain what these ideological brain worms are. And then toward the end of the book, I offer a mind vaccine to hopefully inoculate you against that imbecility.

**BW**: What is the difference between just a plain old bad idea and a parasitic idea?

**GS**:A bad idea could be thinking that having indiscriminate sex will bring me happiness, whereas in reality, I might be a lot happier if I were to find the loving arms of one good woman. Parasitic is a lot worse. It’s me slowly walking to the abyss of infinite lunacy, fully zombified. And as I walk off the cliff, I am proud of whatever ideological position I’m holding. So it’s the Jewish woman proudly walking on campus tearing down the posters of Jewish infants that have been taken as hostages. Because she’s simply more progressive and enlightened than, you know, nasty Middle Eastern Jews like me who don’t understand the nuance of how progressive she is.

***Why postmodernism is dangerous, and not just a fancy academic word:***

**BW**: So there are several parasitic ideas that you describe in the book, among them the culture of perpetual offense and victimhood. The idea that criticizing the West is a progressive virtue, the kind of radical feminism that I began to encounter in college that said genital mutilation is just cultural difference. You argue, I think, very convincingly, that the root of all of these parasitic ideas is postmodernism. What is postmodernism? And second, why is it so sticky to people?

**GS**: Yes. So postmodernism at its root simply says that there are no objective truths other than the one objective truth, and that’s the idea there are no objective truths. You have an exhibition of invisible art. I mean, that’s, by the way, literally true. I cited in the book, right, where you just walk in and you just literally infuse into the empty canvas whatever you want, because who are we to judge what is beautiful, and why do we simply say that Rembrandt and Chagall are beautiful? You know, art is in the eye of the beholder. There are no objective, aesthetic truths. I think it’s nonsensical, but at least it doesn’t have catastrophic consequences. When you apply postmodernism to the philosophy of knowledge, if there’s no objective truth, who are you to say that cutting off the clitoris of little girls is a bad thing, right? And so it becomes a complete free-for-all. Now, why is it so sticky, as you said? Why is it something so alluring? Because, remember, earlier I said that all of these idea pathogens free us from the pesky shackles of reality. There you go. Postmodernism frees me from this really shackling and constraining thing. I’m not defined by my genitalia. I could be anything. How freeing is that? It’s so great to be able to navigate the world completely unencumbered by any constraints of reality.

**BW**: The difference between being a gay mom in L.A. and a gay mom in Beirut or Tehran or Gaza, you know, obviously those are very different contexts, like a universe apart. And 100 percent of the time, everyone would choose America. Why is that not enough to defeat the parasite, pop the bubble of unreality?

**GS**:Imagine if I tell you that there is no singular worse thing than to be judgmental against another culture, nothing worse. The idea that I would pass a value-laden judgment on another people, especially if I define them as being brown people. By the way, not all Muslims are brown. Albanian Muslims are a lot whiter than you are. But somehow it has been co-opted into Islam as a religion of brown people. Then there is nothing worse that I can do, if I’m speaking as a progressive, than to cast judgment on them. So, yes, in the deep recesses of my mind, I know that as a gay woman, I would have a much different trajectory in my life if I’m in Yemen than if I am in New York. But it just feels icky. It feels gauche to me to criticize the cultural values and religious values in Yemen. And therefore, since there’s nothing worse than being judgmental in a bigoted way, that’s the hill I’m going to die on.

**BW**: How did universities become such hotbeds for these parasitic ideas? How did that happen?

**GS**:In the most mundane way, it happens when you have hiring committees that only wish to have lunch with people who share their values. If I am a Trump hater, I simply can’t stomach the possibility that a rational human being might have very compelling reasons why they wish to vote for Donald Trump. Because I attribute that difference in political orientation to that person being irrational, being bigoted. And so there are several mechanisms that result in the echo chamber, but in the most fundamental earthly manner, you just end up closing the doors to anyone who is not exactly like you. The heartbreaking stories that I receive from people: “Dear Professor Saad, my supervisor found out that I said something kind or complimentary about Donald Trump, and he’s now taken off my name from a paper that I’ve worked on for the past year. I don’t think I’ve got a future in that lab. Are you taking on any doctoral students?” What I just said didn’t happen in North Korea. It didn’t happen in the struggle sessions of Mao Tse-Tung. It happened on a North American campus.

***On leaving his longtime campus because of antisemitism:***

**BW**:Your book came out at the end of 2020. We’re now four years since then, and there has been an explosion of antisemitism everywhere, but most intensely on college campuses. I think, given your particular instinct for danger, how do you see where we are right now? How do you diagnose it?

**GS**: The writing on the wall is not a good one. Now there are several reasons for that. One of them is ideological—the parasitic idea allowed to flourish on campuses that Jews are white colonialists engaging in the daily genocide of noble brown people.

But there’s also a demographic one. In the United States and Canada, historically, certainly in the last 40, 50, 60 years, it was viewed as inappropriate to openly and brazenly engage in Jew hatred. Things have changed now. I’ve seen it. The reason I’m a visiting professor at Northwood University is because I couldn’t bear the possibility of returning to my home university, Concordia University, which has been referred to colloquially as Gaza University for over 20 years. You can’t begin to imagine what it’s like for the typical Jewish student or faculty to go to Concordia now. So now imagine someone with my profile walking into campus. And so I decided that it was time for me to take a leave of absence. What could be more of a canary in the coal mine?

**BW**: You’re saying that you’re leaving Montreal or leaving your campus Concordia in Montreal because of antisemitism?

**GS**: One-hundred percent. Now, there are other reasons why. Look, it’s invigorating to go somewhere else. Even if there wasn’t any of that antisemitism, it’s nice to try a new trajectory. It invigorates you. But overwhelmingly, the main reason why I did not go back is because I don’t really like the idea of being potentially knifed. I think the canaries are singing really loudly, and it takes an imbecile to ignore those signs.

***The psychology of Jew hatred:***

**BW**:Explain to me how antisemitism, a topic I thought a lot about, is often the expression of these parasitic ideas. In other words, why is it that it’s coming first, or maybe primarily, for Jews?

**GS**:So there are several mechanisms, some of which, you’re right, are due to parasitic ideas. But let me start with a different explanation for why antisemitism is so alluring to so many people. In psychology, there is something called the fundamental attribution error. So, for example, do you attribute successes or failures internally or externally? Now, for most people, they attribute successes internally. I did well on the exam because I’m very smart. And they attribute the failures externally. I did poorly on the exam because Professor Saad is a Jew asshole. And for most people, that’s a very comforting way to navigate through the world. It protects my ego. Now, imagine if I can find an external culprit for all of my failures. It’s the diabolical Jew. You just got diabetes; it’s because Jews are holding on to the cure for diabetes, they’re greedy, they’re not distributing it. So I think beyond these parasitic ideas that we’ve been talking about, it’s something that is innately part of the architecture of the human mind. I need to protect my ego. What better way to attribute all of my failures to some cause? And in this case, it’s the Jew.

For better or worse, Jews end up dominating in many places in philosophy and music, in academia and medicine and law. So imagine from the perspective of the non-Jew in those societies, there are these few assholes. Every time I go to my lawyer, he’s a Jew and the physician is a Jew. And the professor in the classroom is a Jew. I’m not successful. There must be some grand machination that causes these people to lead. Yes, we could talk about theological reasons why Islam hates the Jews and why Christians hate the Jews. But from a deep psychological level, I think that that’s the primary reason.

***Making the case for Trump:***

**BW**: I want to explain how someone like you, who’s committed their life, as you write about, to reason and the pursuit of truth, prefers Donald Trump, someone with such a history of lying and such a compromised character, if I can put it diplomatically. Why do you prefer him to Kamala Harris? What’s your decision-making framework?

**GS**:It would be immigration policy. It would be economic policies that are consistent with capitalism. And another one I didn’t mention. Earlier, you referred to equality of outcomes, which of course Kamala Harris is into, which is the antithesis of a meritocracy, which is the opposite of individual dignity. Well, I believe that the ethos of meritocracy is foundational to the United States. The ethos of equality of outcomes is a cancer to individual dignity. So it would probably be those three things.
