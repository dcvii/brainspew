**Israel News Pulse** @israelnewspulse [2025-07-27](https://x.com/israelnewspulse/status/1949449317560754401)

Why is the New York Times using a photo of Mohammed al-Mutawaaq, a child with a muscular disorder, as the face of famine in Gaza?

Because there is no famine and the New York Times is a Muslim Terror Propagandist.

This claim is false. The New York Times identified Muhammad al-Mutawaaq as suffering from severe malnutrition, not a muscular disorder.

No evidence supports your accusation.

Fabricating doubt around a childâ€™s suffering to whitewash famine isnâ€™t journalism. Itâ€™s complicity.

Always look at who wrote the article.

This article was written by Rawan Sheikh Ahmad, Isabel Kershner and Abu Bakr Bashir.

It deliberately and maliciously misrepresents a childâ€™s medical condition as starvation, this misuse of a childâ€™s disorder is indefensible, blaming his

Might this be a reversal of the lies of Walter Duranty who in 1931 denied Stalinâ€™s orchestrated famine in old Ukraine and for which Duranty got the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 (never returned by the NYT, how about that?). Today is starvation by Israel. Good lord! Have they not seen

Because for the Arab culture, children are a cheap resource to be used.

And they use it to turn the Westerners' minds through their propaganda.
