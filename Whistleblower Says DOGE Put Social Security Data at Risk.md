The whistleblower report, filed with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel and members of Congress, said the uploaded data included records of all Social Security numbers issued by the federal government, including full names, birth dates and other personal information. The whistleblower, Chuck Borges, didn’t indicate in his complaint that the database had been breached.

But the account by Borges, who serves as SSA’s chief data officer, adds to allegations raised in lawsuits and by watchdog groups about the risk of DOGE personnel having access to sensitive data involving millions of Americans and failing to take proper steps to ensure its safety.

The Social Security Administration said in a statement that the agency and its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, “take all whistleblower complaints seriously” and SSA “stores all personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information.” The agency said it was “not aware of any compromise to this environment” and it remains “dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.”

The details of the report were reported earlier by the [New York Times](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NYT).

The report, released by the Government Accountability Project, an organization that represents whistleblowers, said in June DOGE’s access to the data “escalated in scope and gravity when DOGE personnel appeared to have given themselves authorization to create a copy of SSA’s entire set of data on the American public without any independent security or oversight mechanisms in place in violation of laws and creating enormous vulnerabilities.”

Later that month, the complaint says that Michael Russo, a DOGE-affiliated official who serves as SSA’s chief information officer, approved a request to allow the sensitive data to be copied to an internal “DOGE specific cloud environment that lacked independent security controls.”

The approval came after [the Supreme Court sided](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/supreme-court-doge-cases-4ba14a15?page=1&mod=article_inline) with the Trump administration in allowing DOGE, the cost-cutting group once led by Elon Musk, to have access to the records.

Borges said there was no auditing or oversight in place to account for how the DOGE personnel were handling the data. But it warns of “catastrophic impact to SSA beneficiaries and SSA programs” if there was unauthorized access to the data and notes that “re-issuance of Social Security Numbers to all who possess one was a potential worst case outcome…underscoring the risk to the public.”

Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said “this is the danger we fear and warned of,” adding, “All oversight has been lost, all accountability gone.”
