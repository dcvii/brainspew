Hi there,

We‚Äôve got some great content for you this week.

The first is a talk **Tristan Harris** gave a couple of weeks ago at TED in Vancouver titled **‚ÄúWhy AI is Our Ultimate Test and Greatest Invitation.**‚Äù Tristan received a standing ovation from the crowd at TED. It's a compelling listen‚Äîand it's only 15 minutes of your time. Click on the green button to go through to the talk now.

There is some deep thinking in the talk, and Tristan has expanded out into a longer article (10 minute read, below). Tristan‚Äôs TED talk is a great companion piece to our podcast episode this week. It‚Äôs a deep dive on AGI between co-founders **Aza Raskin** and .

As you know, Silicon Valley is racing toward AI systems that could soon match or surpass human intelligence. There has been endless jockeying from experts and labs about whose going to ‚Äòwin‚Äô the race to AGI and whose prediction is closest - sometimes I honestly feel like the conversation resembles talk in a sports bar.

That misplaced focus really distracts us from thinking about the enormity of the changes that are coming, and whether we can slow it all down. So do listen to this episode to understand more of the nuance in this conversation. This also a great listen if you need a neat primer on what AGI actually is.

We've extracted the key takeaways from the episode into a short-read article. Could you please let me know if you like that format? and I are experimenting with the format and want to make them as useful and interesting as possible to you - so feedback is really welcome.

Cheers,
