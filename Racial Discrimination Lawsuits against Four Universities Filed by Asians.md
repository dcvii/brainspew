### Universities’ Discrimination against Asians Reached Absurd Levels

My son Stanley and I just filed lawsuits against the University of [California](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69630620/ps-zhong-v-the-regents-of-university-of-ca/) (UC), the University of [Washington](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69668915/zhong-v-university-of-washington/) (UW), the University of [Michigan](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69697191/zhong-v-the-regents-of-the-university-of-michigan/) (UM), and [Cornell](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69788141/zhong-v-cornell-university/).

In short, at age 18, co-plaintiff Stanley Zhong was [hired](https://youtu.be/wxvZGnRoY3E?si=GeexpIEqEu5KCpLB) by Google for a PhD-level position after being rejected by 16 colleges for undergraduate admission. His college application story was cited in a [congressional hearing](https://www.youtube.com/live/4Zu5cdfv9kk?si=XufizKznBZZZlnWo&t=2587) in September 2023. We attempted to engage with university officials, state lawmakers, Governor Newsom, and the federal Department of Education, but after being stonewalled or ignored for well over a year, litigation became our only remaining option. More details on Stanley's achievements as a high schooler—including his 1590 SAT score without much preparation, [e-signing startup](https://www.rabbitsign.com/) featured by Amazon Web Services, advancement to the Google Code Jam and Facebook Hacker Cup semifinals, 2nd place finish in the MIT Battlecode, and highest-level Presidential Volunteer Service Award—are outlined in [Section A1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LR--TvDFMUSaRuA8_GPALZYp3IkD5i4x/edit#bookmark=id.ffm9ykef23yl) in our legal complaint, submitted under penalty of perjury.

In addition to Stanley’s specific case, our complaint highlights the [abnormality](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2rSOGoatLHMQSHTHod9ye0i_PxGSr3c/edit#bookmark=id.1erhbdyxk9oa) in Asian enrollment trends at the University of California.

> According to the 2020 U.S. Census, California’s Asian population grew by 25% over the prior decade, making it the fastest-growing ethnic group in the state (See [Exhibit 70](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LR--TvDFMUSaRuA8_GPALZYp3IkD5i4x/edit#heading=h.hyzzywdq6uat)). However, Asian student representation at UC declined from 38% in 2002 to 32% in 2022, with a general decline in Chinese American enrollment between 2018 and 2024 (See [Exhibits 71](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LR--TvDFMUSaRuA8_GPALZYp3IkD5i4x/edit#heading=h.dja7ykqcw92b) and [Exhibit 72](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LR--TvDFMUSaRuA8_GPALZYp3IkD5i4x/edit#heading=h.9rkmthojf8nq)). At UC Berkeley, one of the most selective campuses of the UC system, Asian admits trended significantly downward in recent years. The percentage of Asian applicants admitted by UC Berkeley went from 18.9% (3,188 out of 16,866) in 2014 to 15.8% (4,416 out of 27,875) in 2023. (See [Exhibit 73](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LR--TvDFMUSaRuA8_GPALZYp3IkD5i4x/edit#heading=h.sqrpyu3627ru). 2023 is the latest year for which the data is publicly available.)

Even with the limited public data available, we can easily infer substantial SAT score disparities. For example, our complaint against Cornell presents an [analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2rSOGoatLHMQSHTHod9ye0i_PxGSr3c/edit#bookmark=id.wwtdlqnrc3gd) that shows Asian-American applicants face significantly higher SAT score thresholds for admission compared to other racial groups.

> In 2023, the year Stanley applied in, Cornell enrolled 214 African American students. The 25th percentile SAT scores for Cornell students was 1420 (See [Exhibit 64](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2rSOGoatLHMQSHTHod9ye0i_PxGSr3c/edit#heading=h.ibum2gvf9nu0) as well). Nationally, 225,954 African American students took the SAT in 2023, with approximately 1% (roughly 2,259 students) scoring in the 1400–1600 range (See [Exhibit 65](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2rSOGoatLHMQSHTHod9ye0i_PxGSr3c/edit#heading=h.vumb4zwq3q6v)). If Cornell’s African American enrollees reflected the general SAT distribution of Cornell students, approximately 161 (214\*75%) of them would have scored above the 25th percentile of 1420, with an even larger number exceeding 1400. This would mean Cornell enrolled about 7.1% (161/2259) of the nation’s top African American SAT performers.
> 
> Using this analysis, the estimated percentage of national top scorers enrolled at Cornell is approximately 7.1% for African Americans, 1.0% for Asian Americans, 4.1% for Hispanic Americans, and 1.9% for White students (See [Exhibit 66](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2rSOGoatLHMQSHTHod9ye0i_PxGSr3c/edit#heading=h.r94sqlc546ik)).
> 
> Given the geographic distribution of high-achieving students, such a high concentration of top scorers from certain racial groups appears statistically improbable. These figures suggest that Asian-American applicants face significantly higher SAT score thresholds for admission compared to other racial groups. While SAT scores are not the sole measure of merit, this statistical irregularity raises serious concerns about whether Cornell’s admissions policies comply with constitutional and legal prohibitions or limits against racial preferences.

Additionally, our complaints documented concrete instances of universities prioritizing race over academic merit in faculty hiring while concealing it, in clear violation of federal and state laws. The [video](https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1674548940522549248) of the UC Berkeley Law School dean, Mr. Erwin Chemerinsky, is an egregious example. He described and preached the “unstated Affirmative Action” practiced at UC as follows: “Don’t say that \[you are considering the candidate’s race\]. You can think it. You can vote it… Don’t ever articulate that is what you are doing.” He also said "If I'm ever deposed, I'm going to deny I said this to you."

With Asian plaintiffs leading the charge in these four lawsuits, I hope we can move the national conversation about racial preferences in college admissions to a more rational and facts-based stage. For starters, I suggest we use the term *racial preference* instead of *Affirmative Action* because the latter means different things to different people. Yet many people use these two terms interchangeably, perhaps intentionally to muddle the discussions. Let’s not fall for that trap. In pursuit of rational and honest discussions, I sent public debate challenges to every vocal Harvard supporter I could find in the SFFA case—thus far, none have responded over the past year. I will keep trying. Ultimately, our goal is to win in not only the court of law but also the court of public opinion.

### AI, the Game Changer

For highly politicized lawsuits like ours, the lawyers leaning left don’t want to take them, and the lawyers on the right think that the courts in California are too biased for us to possibly win. So we are forced to represent ourselves.

Our 'legal team' consists of ChatGPT and Gemini. They did a fantastic job of drafting the legal complaints. For $20 a month, 24/7 access, and no conflict of interest to worry about, we can hardly expect more! When the lawyer of one of the universities objected to the scope of our litigation hold notice, our AI-drafted response compelled them to back down and fully comply with our document retention request.

Furthermore, we are developing a trial preparation tool named TrialGPT. It would run trial simulations where different AI agents take the roles of the plaintiff, defendant, judge, jury, witness, etc. The goal is to find the optimal litigation strategy (e.g. Arlington Heights framework vs. McDonnell-Douglas framework), anticipate the defence moves, and maximize our win rate.

As pro se litigants with no legal background, our battle against well-resourced universities and their top legal teams is undeniably a David vs. Goliath fight. AI may just be the sling we need.

### AI-Guided Legal Strategy for Our Lawsuits

Our discussions with AI led to the formulation of the following principles.

#### Start with the low hanging fruit

The federal Department of Education administers Minority Serving Institution (MSI) grant programs with eligibility criteria based on specific racial enrollment thresholds. For example, the Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Program mandates at least 25% Hispanic enrollment. Our AI-assisted legal analysis strongly suggests that such race-based requirements are unconstitutional. If the court concurs, the University of California’s pursuit of HSI status—and its corresponding 25% Hispanic enrollment target—would place its admissions policies on legally precarious ground.

#### Leverage state laws

Stanley applied just before the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in *SFFA v. Harvard*. However, California, Washington, and Michigan have each had state laws prohibiting racial preference or discrimination in public education since 1996, 1998, and 2006, respectively. UC, UW, and UM have all faced past lawsuits over racial discrimination, including *Bakke* and *Grutter* at the Supreme Court. Bringing them to court again holds significant symbolic weight and far-reaching national implications.

#### Leverage recent court rulings

Cornell falls under the jurisdiction of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, whose 2024 decision in *Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York (CACAGNY) v. Adams* strongly supports our case. The ruling affirmed that a facially neutral policy driven by racial motives violates equal protection, even if aggregate enrollment improves. It explicitly states that “if discriminatory intent is proven, a negative effect or harm from that discriminatory policy on individual Asian-American students applying to the SHSs \[Specialized High Schools\] would be sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny review.”

#### Bring it to the Supreme Court

UC, UW, UM, and Cornell fall under three different circuit courts. If we secure victories in some cases while facing losses in others—creating a potential *circuit split* —it would significantly increase the likelihood of the Supreme Court granting certiorari to resolve the conflicting rulings.

### You Can Help

While we have whistleblower reports regarding the secret use of race at each of the universities sued, we are actively collecting more for both student admissions and faculty hiring, whether anonymous or not.
