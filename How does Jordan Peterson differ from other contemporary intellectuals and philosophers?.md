Peterson is different in many ways, but I think the primary ways he differs most importantly are three.

1. He embraces new media. He doesn’t just wait for interviews on CNN and the usual circuits, he goes long form in podcasts and YouTube. Most academics with the general exception of the sciencey sort you now expect on TED, seem to have an aversion to talking to the internet public, or a desire to just have a soundbite out there. His work goes on audiobook. He put together the Self Authoring

	website. And he literally says - when it comes to undergraduate material, using the web allows him to be far more influential than in the traditional classroom. And he can make more money. He’s a new kind of intellectual in that regard, and he aims to change higher education. He isn’t hiding in an ivory tower.
2. He is multi-disciplinary in his approach. That’s not highly unusual, but it is not mainstream. Most intellectuals do not do well in bringing literary or artistic references into their work. But he seeks to address a broader set of understanding with a willingness to engage on many levels and multiple directions at once

	. Yet he does so without developing select opinions for their own sake. He is not political for the sake of being political, or religious for the sake of being religious - but he knows how his knowledge impacts those who hold certain religious or political views. Most importantly in this regard, he has respect for the history of thought, and does not simply present the leading edge as a fait accompli in order to discredit those from the past or declare heresies.
3. He communicates from the heart. When he comes across an argument that is ridiculous from the point of view of his academic discipline, he doesn’t not politely suggest that ‘we profoundly disagree’. He is unsparingly blunt in a completely honest way. Similarly he is emotionally open in a way that is not staged or condescending

	. In that way he is very much like Richard Feynman, one of the great thinkers of our lifetimes. He is a full person who tries to be a completely better person - he doesn’t sacrifice his character to his profession. He doesn’t attempt to be fashionable and appeal to elites who would gild his celebrity.
