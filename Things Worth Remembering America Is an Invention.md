_**Welcome to Things Worth Remembering, in which writers recall wisdom from the past that we should commit to heart. In today’s edition, Dominic Green tells the story of a mural that was painted in the U.S. Capitol during the American Civil War—and of the poem it was based on.**_

It was the first major clash of the American Civil War. In the rolling hills of northern Virginia, some 60,000 soldiers gathered to fight the First Battle of Bull Run. Nearly 5,000 of them would become casualties. Up and down the country, a divided society realized that a long and bloody conflict lay ahead.

The month was July, the year 1861. Thirty miles to the east, in Washington, D.C., a middle-aged German artist climbed a ladder in the Capitol Building—and started painting a mural.

His name was Emanuel Leutze, and what he produced was an American epic, 20 feet high and 30 feet wide, depicting a wagon train of pioneers cresting a bluff and seeing their destination, the Golden Gate of San Francisco Bay. Two men push the wheel of a cart that is close to toppling, on their way up the snaking, rocky path. A woman in a dark green dress clutches her baby in a blanket. A red-shirted man with a thick ginger beard stands in his stirrups to see the sun setting on this new world. On the down slope, two men open the path for the next stage of the journey by hacking at a fallen tree with alternating blows of their axes.

The margins of the mural carry portraits of Daniel Boone, who explored Kentucky, and William Clark, who surveyed the Oregon Territory with Meriwether Lewis. A decade earlier, Leutze had painted the magnificent _[Washington Crossing the Delaware](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11417)_. But in this mural, the heroes are the anonymous emigrants who traveled in the famous explorers’ wake, across the desert and the mountains to the gates of the West.

One figure who is seen looking away from the sunset is a freed slave, who calms a mule, staring into the distance over the viewer’s right shoulder. Lodged in the very center of the mural, he is thought to be a late addition, representing a recent development: The mural was finished in November 1862, two months after Abraham Lincoln issued the [Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals_iv/sections/transcript_preliminary_emancipation.html). And so it alludes simultaneously to the great hope at the heart of American history and to its darker chapters; it represents those who chose to go west across the Atlantic and those who were forced. It shows the invention of America by its pioneers, and the violent reinvention of America that was taking place while the artist was up his ladder.

And ultimately, it looks to the future. The eye is drawn to a man in the background of the painting**,** scrambling up the vertical rock face, an American flag in one hand. We see that he intends to plant the Stars and Stripes on the summit—but he hasn’t quite reached it yet. Along the top, Leutze painted a curved blue riband, trimmed in gold. On it, he printed the mural’s title in golden letters: _[Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way](https://www.aoc.gov/explore-capitol-campus/art/westward-course-empire-takes-its-way)_.

Leutze himself had traveled westward, though by boat rather than wagon. Born in Württemberg, in Central Europe, he had crossed the Atlantic at the age of 9—about the same age as the boy he painted here sitting on a bullock, his bow and arrows on his lap, and his prize, a rabbit, in his hand. But the title of the mural belongs to another pioneer. It comes from a poem by the Anglo Irish bishop and philosopher George Berkeley—the man who gave his name to a college at Yale University, and to an entire university on the West Coast.

In 1728, nearly a century before Leutze’s birth, Berkeley sailed westward across the Atlantic. That same year, he wrote some “[Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America](https://americainclass.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2_BERKELEY-VERSES-ON-THE-PROSPECT-OF-PLANTING-ARTS-AND-LEARNING-IN-AMERICA.pdf).” The poem is a less-than-fond farewell to the hopeless continent of his birth. It begins:

> _The Muse, disgusted at an age and clime  
> Barren of every glorious theme,  
> In distant lands now waits a better time,  
> Producing subjects worthy fame._

Berkeley had always been a traveler; like most wealthy young British men, he made a “grand tour” of Europe before beginning university. But he wrote this poem as a middle-aged man no longer inspired, it seems, by the old capitals and overbearing past of a small continent. When he sailed for New England and settled in Rhode Island, he sought the new horizons that Leutze would capture in the mural he painted over a hundred years later.

I know the feeling. I grew up in London in a family of jazz musicians, so I grew up listening to America. I also crossed the ocean—as a young adult, encountering the Statue of Liberty wreathed in mist at dawn, like so many immigrants have done. I wasn’t in steerage; I was working my passage as a musician on an ocean liner. Later, I would raise a family in America, and become a citizen.

I moved back to the UK recently, but as I look across the pond, I still see the promise of my America, and everyone’s America. There, Berkeley wrote, “There shall be sung another golden age,”

> _Not such as Europe breeds in her decay;  
> Such as she bred when fresh and young,  
> When heavenly flame did animate her clay. . ._ 

Berkeley was a pioneer in another sense, becoming perhaps the first American philosopher. He believed in spirit over matter, in potential and possibility. He told the English writer Samuel Johnson that reality was immaterial. And though Johnson responded by [kicking a rock and saying](https://www.grubstlodger.uk/2023/06/i-refute-it-thus-in-which-johnson-kicks.html), “I refute it thus,” the rest of the world still sees America as Berkeley would have: as an idea. In fact, it is a _land_ of ideas.

And yes, it may happen that America is cruel to those who cross the Atlantic, but nevertheless: For so many people, for so many years, America has been the last, best hope. The rest of the West sees its future in America. No other society has imagined so much, or made and remade itself so frequently. It was Americans who first enabled a human being to fly, Americans who put a man on the moon. It was America that brought electric light into the homes of ordinary people, in the form of Thomas Edison’s bulb. And it was America that brought joy into sitting rooms around the world, with its dazzling entertainment industry. Europe has great pastry, but it hasn’t invented a tech “unicorn” to rival the likes of Google or OpenAI.

There is something about the forever-young society of the world’s oldest continuously democratic country, itself a moon shot launched from older British traditions. It is worth remembering that today, as the latest administration reinvents the nation in a frenzy, America remains a beacon for people all over the world.

Leutze painted, more than 150 years ago, an image of hope in an age of division. He was inspired by Berkeley’s vision, almost 300 years ago, of a new world that did not yet exist. His mural is still there in the Capitol, though the lawmakers filing into the House of Representatives, heads bowed over their phones, may take it for granted. The potential and possibility of America is still there. This land remains as it was in Berkeley’s final, and most famous, stanza: a final frontier, where those who dare may find—and build—a new world.

> _Westward the course of empire takes its way;  
> The first four acts already past,  
> A fifth shall close the drama with the day;  
> Time’s noblest offspring is the last._
