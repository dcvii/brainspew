Everything you hear about racism in the US comes from the people who are most sensitive to it. Just like the victims of autism. Just like the victims of fat shaming. Just like the celebrities who have been groped over the past 20 years. When you listen to the media from the US, you get the most dramatic version of the most sensational news possible. Why? Because it pays for the media to broadcast exactly that.

If racism in America were a huge common problem, and everybody was affected, then it would be all over YouTube. More than Rickrolling

, more than Big Shaq. Everybody would be showing exactly what is happening in their lives that is so painful. But everybody is not doing that. Everybody is taking their clues from big media.

Here’s Trayvon Martin

. Actually killed. And yes you’ve actually heard of him, and perhaps you still think of him. If his story was typical, you’d see it all over blogs and social media. But what kind of things do you see on social media that reflects the reality of people’s lives? Stuff like this: A shouting match between students and faculty in a college cafeteria.

And believe me when I tell you, this was probably one of the the biggest racism stories of the year. But that’s what we have here, are big racism stories. Just part of the big story telling business of America. What I wish I could show you is how boring everyday life is. I wish I could let you watch a webcam over at Del Amo, which is one of the biggest malls in the world - where you could see a typical day of all kinds of Americans going about their peaceful daily existence. But then again, that’s not interesting, is it?

But when we actually had Nazis over in some town called Charlottesville

, boy that was exciting. Except for this cop.

Nothing we can’t handle.
