### An Executive Strategy Primer on How Distribution, Tokenization, and Reward Shape AI Leverage in 2025

*Look, I know most of us are not CTOs or CEOs. The last time I did a strategy Substack I noticed it kind of flopped, and I am perfectly fine with that. Don’t worry, there will be lots of articles aimed at a wider audience coming up.*

*Here’s why I wrote this one:*

*I think periodically stepping back and understanding the real drivers shaping AI distribution dynamics is highly valuable.*

*Because at the end of the day understanding the real drivers of AI strategy is the key to not getting surprised in 2025. Solid reading of the fundamental drivers in AI ultimately shapes reliable future planning and investment.*

***TLDR; we all live in this world, so we should at least understand it.***

> *I’d underline from the video: if you plan to operate at the mid-senior level or above in AI anywhere in the next 5 years, you need to be at least fluent in C-suite strategic dynamics like this to be successful longterm.*

*The alternative is not engaging strategically, not letting the future happen to us one token at a time. And I for one would prefer to actually think about where I’m going.*

*This one is deliberately crisp and executive readable. You can get through it in 10 minutes. But you’re going to chew on it for the next two days, and it’s going to haunt you when you read the news tomorrow.*
