When Aaron Leanhardt was a graduate student in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he was part of a research team that cooled sodium gas to the [lowest temperature ever recorded](https://news.mit.edu/2003/cooling) in human history.

What his colleagues didn’t realize was that in the rare moments when Leanhardt wasn’t toiling away at the lab, he was moonlighting as a speedy shortstop in a [local amateur baseball league](https://www.bostonmabl.com/). Leanhardt was good enough to play in a 2001 All-Star Game at a minor-league stadium in Lowell. He [hit.464](https://400hitter.com/career.asp?PlID=121&TmID=6&SeID=2) that season.

“We didn’t even know about that,” said David Pritchard, a professor emeritus at MIT.

More than two decades later, the baseball world suddenly knows all about the 48-year-old Leanhardt. He’s the inventor of the so-called “torpedo bat,” perhaps the most significant development in bat technology in decades.

Leanhardt’s creation exploded into the mainstream this weekend, when the New York Yankees tied a major-league record by bashing 15 home runs in the first three games of their season. Nine of the homers came from players who have adopted the torpedo bat, including three from infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr.

Now, players across the league are desperately scrambling to get their hands on Leanhardt’s creation.

None of this seemed likely when Leanhardt was earning his doctorate and spending seven years teaching at the University of Michigan. But he would leave academia to pursue a higher calling: the solution to a complex, century-old physics problem with significant real-world applications. He wanted to know how to effectively hit a round ball with a wooden bat.

“This,” former Yankees minor-leaguer Kevin Smith said, “is probably the least impressive thing he’s done in his entire life.”

Leanhardt’s solution, which he devised a couple of years ago as a minor-league hitting coordinator for the Yankees, moves the fat part of the bat closer to the handle rather than the end. The result is a product that better resembles a bowling pin than a traditional bat, redistributing the weight to the area where players most often make contact with the ball.

The idea behind the new design was to help batters make more contact at a time when strikeouts are at an all-time high. Leanhardt eventually came to think about the bat as having what he describes as a “wood budget.” The goal was to use as much of that budget as possible in the ideal spot—six or 7 inches below the tip—without sacrificing swing speed.

With that theory in mind, Leanhardt dreamed up a bat that looked unlike anything the sport has ever seen. To turn his vision into a reality, his concept had to comply with MLB’s bat specifications. Rule 3.02 specifies that bats must be “a smooth, round stick not more than 2.61 inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length.”

Surprisingly, the torpedo bat qualifies. At this point, Leanhardt says, he is on a “first-name basis with everyone who operates the lathe for every bat manufacturer in baseball.”

The last step was generating buy-in from players. Initially, the uptake was slow. But after the Yankees’ home-run barrage on the opening weekend of the season, that is no longer an issue.

“It’s just about making the bat as heavy and fat as possible in the area where you’re trying to do damage on the baseball,” Leanhardt said.

Leanhardt joined the Miami Marlins’ as their field coordinator this winter following six years with the Yankees. Before all that, he was a standout at MIT. Wolfgang Ketterle, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2001, called Leanhardt “one of the handful of absolute outstanding students” he has taught in nearly 30 years at the school.

In baseball, it took longer for his talent to be recognized. Chris Lewis still remembers the first time he encountered Leanhardt. Lewis was the head coach at a school in Eastern Montana called Dawson Community College in 2017. Leanhardt’s only baseball experience was a summer coaching gig in an independent professional league, but he was interested in the open hitting coach role on Lewis’s staff.

“His résumé looked like some kind of physics project,” Lewis said. “I was like, ‘Holy cow, I can’t even read this thing.’”

Lewis was curious to know why someone with Leanhardt’s background wanted to come to Montana. Leanhardt told him that he always loved baseball, wanted to break into coaching and was willing to accept low pay and long hours for the opportunity.

He was there for one season before successfully applying for a job with the Yankees. Now Leanhardt and his torpedo bats are the talk of the sport.

“Dude,” Lewis said, “that’s the most interesting man in baseball.”
