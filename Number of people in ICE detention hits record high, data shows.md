ICE held more than 68,400 people as of 14 December, breaking previous high set at beginning of December

The number of people in immigration detention in the US has hit an all-time high according to data published by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ([ICE](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement)). The data, which comes out every two weeks, shows that as of 14 December 2025, ICE held more than 68,400 people.

This many people in immigration detention is a new record, breaking the previous high set at the beginning of December.

The Guardian, using ICE’s data, has continued to track the number of people arrested, detained and deported by the agency. The latest, published on 22 December covers 1 October through 14 December 2025. The Guardian has been tracking this data and has calculated the total number of people the administration has arrested, detained and deported since January 2025.

In total, the administration has arrested more than 328,000 and deported nearly 327,000.

In one of the biggest changes in immigration enforcement policies, immigrants with [no criminal record](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data) continue to make up the largest group in US immigration detention, despite the administration’s rhetoric about focusing its anti-immigration efforts on “the worst of the worst” criminals. Being undocumented in the US is a civil not a criminal infraction. The Trump administration has also moved to invalidate protections for many immigrants staying in the US legally.

## At this unsettling time

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year into his second term, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump returned to office. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful.**

We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, we’ll show you far fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you for protecting the free press.**
