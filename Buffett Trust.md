In the summer of 1991, Mary Gates, the mother of the Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, convinced her workaholic 35-year-old son to spend the July 4 holiday at Hood Canal, a scenic, outdoorsy location about two hours from Seattle that had long been the family getaway.

The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, was among the guests. When Mrs. Gates tried to introduce her son to Mr. Buffett, however, he brushed her off, saying that he didn’t want to meet a “stockbroker.”

But the two men hit it off immediately. Settling into a patterned couch, Mr. Buffett, dressed in a red polo shirt and dark trousers, his left foot propped up against the coffee table, and Mr. Gates in a tennis outfit — shorts and a white shirt, his white socks coming up to mid-calf, his mop of hair tousled — talked for 11 hours straight. The other guests had to pull them apart. Mr. Gates was surprised by the penetrating questions Mr. Buffett directed at him about the software business, and found himself warming to the avuncular Midwestern billionaire.

The two have been close friends ever since. Once, recounting the story of their meeting to students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Mr. Gates called it an “unbelievable friendship.” Mr. Buffett quipped, “The moral of that is, listen to your mother.”

Theirs has been an unusual friendship. Mr. Buffett is folksy and outgoing, and never passes up an opportunity to crack a joke. He likes to speak in aphorisms. He enjoys breaking down complex investing principles into simple nuggets that anyone could understand. When he meets new people, Mr. Buffett is genuinely curious about their backgrounds. He asks them questions and listens intently, eyebrows furrowed, to the answers. Banter comes to him easily.

Mr. Gates, 25 years his junior, has a far different public persona. Almost everyone who interacts with him — whether at a gathering, in the office, in small group settings or during interviews — says he can be charming and engaging in the moment, but small talk and repartee are not his forte. He isn’t immediately interested in the person in front of him, but if you asked him a question, he might go on for minutes. Courtesies are lost on him.

Over the next few decades, the two billionaires forged a bond based on free-flowing conversation and a mutual love of bridge, business, problem solving and philanthropy. It was not unusual to see them golfing together at the annual Sun Valley conference, a gathering of luminaries from the worlds of technology, media and business, informally called the “summer camp for billionaires.” A few times a year, Mr. Gates would fly into Omaha on his private jet to spend a few hours with his friend, who sometimes drove to the airport to pick him up.

The essence of their friendship, for Mr. Gates, was captured in a black-and-white photograph that sat in his office at his private firm Gates Ventures, a person who worked there recalled. In the photo, Mr. Buffett is clearly in the middle of delivering a joke, and Mr. Gates has his head thrown back in laughter. Not an especially emotive person, his “laugh out loud” moments were often when he reacted to a joke by Mr. Buffett, shrieking with joy.

In 2004, Mr. Gates joined the board of directors of Mr. Buffett’s giant conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, which Mr. Buffett described as an “act of friendship.” To do so, he had to step down from the board of Icos, the biotechnology company that developed Cialis and the only company other than Microsoft whose board he had been on. By then, Mr. Gates had stepped down as chief executive of Microsoft, although he remained its chairman. (In March 2020, Mr. Gates said he would [step down from the boards of both Berkshire and Microsoft](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/technology/bill-gates-microsoft-board.html) to focus more on his philanthropy.)

As Berkshire global shareholders made their pilgrimage to Omaha for the conglomerate’s annual meeting, they were delighted by the public displays of the pair’s friendship. One year, the duo handed out soft-serve ice cream from Dairy Queen — another Berkshire company — to shareholders. Sometimes, they played Ping-Pong or drove around in a golf cart. As attendees thronged Mr. Buffett, asking for selfies and autographs, Mr. Gates could often be seen standing off to the side, hands tucked under his armpits, happy to let the spotlight shine on his friend.

But the cheery snapshots masked a more complicated tale of friendship, one that, in recent years, has shown signs of cracks. Even as their relationship blossomed, there remained some striking differences, most notably in how they displayed the trappings of their enormous wealth.

In addition to his modest home in Omaha, Mr. Buffett owned only a single vacation property, in Laguna Beach, Calif., that he bought for $175,000 in the early 1970s and has since sold. He has a 6.25 percent interest in a Falcon 2000 operated by NetJets (a Berkshire company), he once told me, adding, “And that’s about it.”

By contrast, Mr. Gates lives a more traditional billionaire’s lifestyle, with multiple homes, planes, expensive art and a big personal staff to oversee it all. Among his possessions: an oil painting by Winslow Homer that [he bought](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/05/us/sale-of-homer-seascape-sets-record.html) for a reported $30 million. A lover of fast cars, Mr. Gates has indulged in luxury wheels over the years, including several Porsches.

And as the years progressed, certain aspects of his behavior, including his stewardship of his foundation, have upset Mr. Buffett, according to four people with insight into their relationship. For more than a decade, Mr. Buffett — known for his love of lean and efficient operations free of bureaucracy — had been bothered by what he saw as the bloat and inflated operating costs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the entity started in 2000 by Mr. Gates and his former wife, which is now known as the Gates Foundation.

In 2023, Mr. Buffett, whose donations to the foundation supercharged its philanthropy for decades, decided that upon his death, the remainder of his fortune — worth more than $100 billion — wouldn’t continue to go to the organization.

It proved to be a telling sign.

The New York Public Library’s flagship building stands in Midtown Manhattan, a national landmark in front of which tourists linger, awe-struck, even as office workers scurry by, inured to its majesty. Built in the Beaux-Arts style, with its tall columns and iconic lions sculpted out of gray and pink Tennessee marble, the library opened in 1911. But on the morning of June 26, 2006, an unremarkable summer day in New York, the 200 or so philanthropy executives, reporters and others gathered inside the marble-lined main hall of the library were riveted less by the building’s quiet magnificence than by the moment they were about to witness.

For days leading up to the event, the media had been buzzing. Invitations sent by Gates Foundation staffers had been cryptic, saying only that Mr. Buffett, along with Mr. Gates and his then-wife, Melinda French Gates, would be making an announcement. Shortly after 11 a.m., Mr. Buffett, who had flown in from Omaha for the news conference, got straight to the point. He had always intended to give 99 percent of his fortune, then estimated at $44 billion, to philanthropy. Now, he had identified the Gates Foundation as the biggest recipient of his generosity during his lifetime.

The world’s second-richest man at the time was handing over his money to the world’s richest man, entrusting Mr. Gates with the challenging, fraught and complicated work of finding the right causes to give to. The symbolism of the location they had chosen for the announcement could hardly be overlooked. The New York Public Library has long stood as a testament to the harnessing of private dollars for the public good.

Its flagship was built with contributions from the Astor, Tilden and Lenox foundations. Later, the nineteenth-century steel magnate Andrew Carnegie would donate $5 million to set up a branch system around the main library. Today, the building is named after Stephen A. Schwarzman, the billionaire co-founder of the private equity behemoth Blackstone, [who gave $100 million to the institution in 2008](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/financier-pledges-100-million-to-new-york-public-library/).

Years before their announcement, Mr. Buffett had presented his younger friend with a copy of Mr. Carnegie’s article “The Gospel of Wealth._”_ In the essay, Mr. Carnegie explained that it was the duty of a wealthy man to give back to society — not through taxes, not by making less, but through personal philanthropy.

In the text, he provided a moral defense of the wealth created by capitalism by arguing that everyone was better off under a market-based economy. A society in which individualism, private property, wealth accumulation and competition are preserved is the “condition of affairs under which the best interests of the race are promoted, but which inevitably gives wealth to the few,” he wrote.

Mr. Carnegie argued that to leave a fortune to one’s children would be to “leave to my son a curse as the almighty dollar,” because it would destroy them, and to leave it to public use upon death would be just a means of disposal and not an active use of the funds by the generator of the fortune.

Instead, he wrote, the “true antidote for the temporary unequal distribution of wealth, the reconciliation of the rich and the poor — a reign of harmony” is for the wealthy man to disburse his fortune. “They have it in their power during their lives to busy themselves in organizing benefactions from which the masses of their fellows will derive lasting advantage, and thus dignify their own lives,” he wrote.

Although Mr. Buffett had long believed in the ideas of Mr. Carnegie, he had little interest in overseeing the disbursement of his own wealth. He liked to stay within what he called his “circle of competence,” arguing that a person shouldn’t assume that because they’re good at one thing, they are good at everything.

Rather, Mr. Buffett had hoped to leave the Berkshire fortune to his first wife, Susan, an abortion rights activist who ran their foundation, to give away, expecting that she would outlive him. But when Mrs. Buffett, who had been diagnosed with cancer, died suddenly of a stroke in July 2004 [at the age of 72](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/30/business/susan-t-buffett-72-corporate-director.html), Mr. Buffett, bereft and blindsided, was forced to revisit his philanthropic plans.

His three children, Susan (known informally as Susie Jr.), Howard and Peter, each had a foundation, but the entities were fledglings. The foundation that his deceased wife had run — called the Buffett Foundation before he renamed it the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation in her honor — was bigger, but not prepared to handle the billions of dollars he was ready to give away.

At the same time, Mr. Gates had been paying more attention to the shape and structure of his philanthropy after quitting his job as chief executive of Microsoft in 2000. Mr. Buffett watched as his friend built an organization that had already begun to reshape global philanthropy. By 2005, when he reflected on his own mortality in his annual letter to shareholders and told them about his intention to give every Berkshire share that he owned to philanthropies, the solution to his conundrum was obvious, even if his decision was impulsive, according to several people who witnessed the events at the time.

Once he had made up his mind, Mr. Buffett held multiple conversations with both Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates about their ambitions for the foundation, and whether they would be able to build the infrastructure necessary to support the billions they would have to give away because of his annual gifts. It was only after he was satisfied with their long-term goals that Mr. Buffett took the momentous step. In doing so, he was repurposing his business strategy to his philanthropy: Just as he picked businesses and investments for Berkshire based on the quality of the managers running them, Mr. Buffett was picking Mr. Gates to run his philanthropy for him.

“What Warren has always done is find out who is the best at doing this, that and the other, and get them to do it,” said Larry Cunningham, a Berkshire shareholder and a professor emeritus at George Washington University. “When it came to philanthropy, that’s what he did, too.”

Mr. Buffett’s gift to the Gates Foundation came with three conditions: One, that either Mr. Gates or Ms. French Gates would remain an active participant in the foundation. (Ms. French Gates, who divorced Mr. Gates in 2021, left the foundation in May.) Two, that the funds that came from Mr. Buffett each year had to qualify as charitable dollars rather than gifts, which are taxed differently. And three, that the value of his annual contributions had to be given away within the year, rather than sitting in the foundation’s endowment, in addition to the 5 percent of net assets that foundations are required to give away under tax law.

Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates further cemented their philanthropic partnership when they, along with Ms. French Gates, announced the Giving Pledge campaign in 2010. It was designed to encourage fellow billionaires to commit at least half their wealth to philanthropy, either during their lifetimes or upon their deaths.

Between 2006 and 2023, Mr. Buffett had given more than $39 billion to the Gates Foundation. By comparison, Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates gave $39 billion between 1994 and 2022, including $22 billion to get the foundation going in 2000. In some years, the former couple gave less than half a billion. In 2021, they pledged $15 billion to the foundation’s endowment, and the following year, they [transferred that money](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/business/gates-foundation-giving.html), as well as another $5 billion Mr. Gates had contributed.

“There is one not-very-well-known but incredibly important reason why the foundation has been able to be so ambitious,” Mr. Gates wrote on his blog in 2022. “Although it is named the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, basically half of our resources to date have come from Warren Buffett’s gifts.”

In the hoopla surrounding Mr. Buffett’s announcement in 2006, an important detail of his plan escaped attention: Although the investor had pledged 99 percent of his wealth to philanthropy, his commitment to the Gates Foundation and the four Buffett family foundations would stand only as long as he lived.

Mr. Buffett, then 75, said he would make separate plans for how to distribute the shares that remained after his death. Some months later, he told Berkshire shareholders in his annual letter that he had stipulated in his will that all Berkshire shares that remained in his pocket when he died would have to be used for philanthropy within a decade of his death. (In 2021, two months shy of his 91st birthday, Mr. Buffett said he had reached only the midpoint of giving away all his shares.)

Only decades later would the broader implications of that lifetime pledge become an issue of significance for future funding at the five foundations and the responsibilities of his three children.

## A Foundation on Speed

When the Gates Foundation got its start in 2000, even Mr. Gates would probably not have predicted that he and Ms. French Gates would have created an entity that can claim to have saved millions of lives, shaped the global public health agenda and propelled the Microsoft co-founder to a level of renown and respect typically reserved for Nobel Peace Prize winners.

By 2005, the year before Mr. Buffett’s announcement, the foundation was already the world’s largest philanthropic organization of its kind. In the years following the Buffett gift, the foundation scrambled to build a far bigger framework that could accommodate the giant waves of money that were about to hit its shores annually and effectively give away many more billions of dollars.

In 2006, it gave away about $1.6 billion; by 2009, it projected it would have to make $3.2 billion worth of grants per year. Today, the foundation’s resources dwarf those of the Ford Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and other big global foundations. The Gates Foundation’s annual budget exceeds that of the World Health Organization.

Not unlike an undulating octopus, the foundation has its tentacles in a variety of global issues, including vaccines, public health, agricultural development, food security, poverty alleviation, sanitation, gender equality and creating digital accounts for the unbanked. With offices scattered across the globe, it has built an enormous — and sometimes invisible — network of ties with governments, multilateral institutions, corporations, countries, universities and nonprofits.

Its way of doing things has cemented “big” or institutionalized philanthropy as distinct from the passive, ad hoc charitable giving long practiced by individual wealthy donors.

In 2019, the foundation — whose influence, size and practices [had already invited criticism](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/bill-gates-philanthropy-misanthropy/) about its approach being neocolonial, antidemocratic and too reliant on the idea that technology can solve all problems, reflecting Mr. Gates’s views — took an even bigger hit to its reputation. Just weeks after Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender and pedophile, was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell, news emerged that Mr. Gates had met with him [several times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-bill-gates.html). Mr. Gates said that he had met Mr. Epstein purely to discuss philanthropy, and that he was sorry for his poor judgment.

Less than two years later, in May 2021, Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates [announced their divorce](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce.html). The following month, Mr. Buffett said he would step down as the third co-trustee of the Gates Foundation, adding that there was no reason for him to stay in the role but that his pledged gifts would continue. “My goals are 100 percent in sync with those of the foundation, and my physical participation is in no way needed to achieve those goals,” he said in a statement.

In January 2022, the foundation created a new board of trustees to improve its corporate governance practices, and to bring fresh perspectives that would inform the next phase of its growth. In a blog post that year announcing that the foundation would spend $9 billion a year by 2026, Mr. Gates expressed his gratitude to his friend. “Warren, I can never adequately express how much I appreciate your friendship and guidance as well as your generosity,” he wrote. More recently, he told The New York Times that Mr. Buffett’s ongoing gifts are “record breaking” and based on his belief in the foundation’s work.

Although civil, the public statements, taken together, contained a sense of an ending, as though viewers of the long theater of a friendship and a world-changing philanthropic partnership were witnessing the final act. And Mr. Buffett was, in fact, making clear to the employees and new trustees of the Gates Foundation that the lifetime pledges he had made in 2006 could come to an end any time given his age and that they shouldn’t count on Berkshire billions when making long-term funding plans, according to several people with knowledge of Mr. Buffett’s motives.

Soon afterward, Berkshire put out a regulatory filing disclosing that Mr. Buffett would donate more shares to his four family foundations. He had already increased his gifts to his children’s foundations once before, in 2012. Mr. Buffett put out a news release in 2023 announcing another round of gifts to the four entities. “They supplement certain of the lifetime pledges I made in 2006 and that continue until my death (at 93, I feel good but fully realize I am playing in extra innings),” he wrote.

He also detailed the plan for the Berkshire shares that would be impossible to give away during his lifetime, given that he had hit only the midpoint in 2021. Valued at around $100 billion in 2023, those shares would be placed into a trust. His three children would be the co-trustees, and they would have a decade after their father’s death to disburse those funds to charity. There was no mention of the Gates Foundation.

Mr. Buffett’s children are in unanimous agreement that none of the remaining shares will go to the Gates Foundation, according to people aware of their thinking. Always deliberate with his language, Mr. Buffett emphasized the word “lifetime” to avoid any miscommunication or confusion about which philanthropies stood to get his money, partly because there was a longstanding assumption within the Gates Foundation that it would always get Mr. Buffett’s money, those people said.

In a footnote to its combined financial statements for 2021 and 2022 that was released in May 2023, the Gates Foundation Trust, which manages the endowment for the foundation, noted for the first time that the Buffett money would no longer come in after his death. “As this gift is conditional and applies only during his lifetime, its receipt cannot be assured in advance of each year’s installment of the gift,” the note said. “After his death, Mr. Buffett’s executors will direct the disposition of his assets.”

In June, Mr. Buffett told The Wall Street Journal that the Gates Foundation would not receive any more money after his death.

Other factors further strained the friendship between Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett. The Gates Foundation had settled into a groove and even become complacent, Mr. Buffett told staffers, which reduced its appetite for taking the kinds of risks that could lead to more effective philanthropy, and that he had hoped his donations would be used for. He was also upset by comments relayed to him by others who had found Mr. Gates rude and condescending, according to multiple accounts. Mr. Buffett had long offered Mr. Gates advice on how to be a friend: Be aware of how your closest friends think of you, Mr. Buffett would tell Mr. Gates, and be good to them.

When this reporter suggested to Mr. Buffett in April that Mr. Gates’s “genuine ‘laugh out loud’ moments are when he’s around you,” he replied, “We have had a huge number of laughs together, and he has a keen sense of humor.”

Nearly every year since starting his GatesNotes blog in 2010, Mr. Gates has posted at least one goofy video of him and Mr. Buffett together or written a brief essay celebrating an aspect of their friendship. But he did not write a single entry solely about his friend in 2021, 2022 or 2023.

In his last GatesNotes post dedicated to Mr. Buffett, in 2020 during the pandemic, Mr. Gates filmed himself in an apron baking an Oreo cookie cake for his friend’s 90th birthday.

Alex Reid, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gates, said the pair didn’t film any videos together because of the pandemic, and they continued not to do so in order to be “mindful of Warren’s age and energy levels.” But Ms. Reid pointed to a slide show of old photographs that Mr. Gates’s team posted on Instagram for Mr. Buffett’s birthday last year.

In a statement that he issued to The Times in May, Mr. Gates said: “I am incredibly lucky to have Warren as a friend and mentor, and our friendship is stronger than ever. I continue to learn from him, and always look forward to my regular calls and visits with him.” Mr. Buffett typically does not initiate the outreach, two of the people familiar with the friendship said, although they added that he has minimized all his interactions given his advanced age.

Speaking of the friendship between the two, a person with knowledge of their relationship said, “All tea leaves point to disturbance in the mythology.”

An earlier version of this article misstated Warren Buffett’s age when he said he had reached the midpoint of giving away all his shares. He was two months shy of his 91st birthday, not 90th.
