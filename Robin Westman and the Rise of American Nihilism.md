Robin Westman wrote his evil thoughts on his guns—on the slides, the magazines, the grips, the barrels. The shooter drew [smiley faces](https://scallywagandvagabond.com/2025/08/annunciation-shooter-robin-westman-manifesto-posted-videos-under-robinw/) on some of the barrels.

On Wednesday morning, as the kids at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis were celebrating their return with the first Mass of the year, Westman approached the stained glass window outside the church where they were gathered and opened fire. Westman murdered an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old and injured 17 others, mostly children.

Then, the 23-year-old turned his gun on himself.

An [11-minute video](https://x.com/Pokemom2R/status/1960765414780363016) allegedly posted by Westman hours before the attack captures him surveying his arsenal.

On the guns are Westman’s handwritten slogans:

“6 million wasn’t enough.”

“Humanity is overrated.”

“Israel must fall.”

“Burn Israel.”

“Kill Donald Trump.”

As well as:

“Sponsored by Blackrock.”

“I’m the Woker, Baby, Why So Queerious?”

“Fart Nigga.”

“McVeigh.”

And, [in Russian](https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/08/28/minneapolis-school-shooter-wrote-i-am-terrorist-and-kill-yourself-in-russian-on-weapon-magazines-and-listened-to-russian-rappers/#google_vignette), “I am a terrorist” and “bitch.”

On the cover of Westman’s handwritten manifesto there was a sticker with a rifle on top of a trans flag, next to the words “ [Defend Equality](https://time.com/7312882/minneapolis-shooter-robin-robert-westman-catholic-church-school-shooting-transgender/).”

In the wake of the tragedy, as with all of these tragedies, we want to know how it happened. And who did it. And why Westman chose this time and place. (Westman’s mother apparently [used to work](https://foxbaltimore.com/news/nation-world/suspect-in-deadly-minneapolis-shooting-identified-as-man-in-his-early-20s-catholic-school-church-mass-minnesota-president-donald-trump-governor-tim-walz-fbi-investigation-active-shooter-gunman-suspect-guns-weapons-rifle-shotgun-pistol) at Annunciation Catholic School.)

But most of all, we want to know why. We want to know why, not just so we can assign blame, but so we can make sense of a country where murdering children can happen on any given Wednesday.

MAGA social-media personality Benny Johnson [blamed transgenderism](https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1960754578250445056); Westman started [identifying as female in 2020](https://foxbaltimore.com/news/nation-world/suspect-in-deadly-minneapolis-shooting-identified-as-man-in-his-early-20s-catholic-school-church-mass-minnesota-president-donald-trump-governor-tim-walz-fbi-investigation-active-shooter-gunman-suspect-guns-weapons-rifle-shotgun-pistol), when he was 17. (Robin Westman used to be Robert Westman.)

“The trans movement is radicalizing the mentally ill into becoming violent terrorists who target children for murder,” Johnson posted on X. The writer and activist [Christopher F. Rufo added](https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1960769904258469938) that the transgender movement “has done grave damage to millions of Americans, and has unleashed a nihilistic wave of violence on our society. Enough.”

The anti-gun activists [blamed guns](https://x.com/MomsDemand/status/1960744625162895594). “Back to school should never mean back to school shootings,” Moms Demand Action tweeted shortly after the shooting. “This is the devastating reality of America’s gun violence crisis.”

Conservatives, hoping perhaps to deflect the blame from guns, blamed mental illness. “This is the profile, all too common in such cases, of a young person who is mentally ill,” *The Wall Street Journal* ’s [editorial board noted](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/minneapolis-shooting-annunciation-catholic-school-robin-westman-dfcf73d3?st=H12k8v).

Meanwhile, former Democratic lawmaker Dave Aronberg, in Florida, singled out Westman’s Jew hatred. “Antisemitism starts with Jews, but never ends with Jews,” [Aronberg tweeted](https://x.com/aronberg/status/1960764996599656911).

And the antisemites blamed the Jews. “Westman is a racial jew, that’s how you have ‘Satanic jewish’ people,” the X account [Six Million posted](https://x.com/SixMillionNerds/status/1960798493406110015). “Ffs.”

All that finger-pointing obscures a deeper point: Westman seems to have been driven by an all-consuming, destructive force, a nihilism—the conviction that life is meaningless; that words like *truth*, *justice* and *God* are empty slogans; that everything must be razed.

Nihilism is not some obscure academic notion. It stretches back to the 19th century—early Russian radicals were called nihilists—and it has waxed and waned across the past 150 years. Today, you can feel the nihilist impulse coursing through America, which has been mostly stripped of its faith and a shared national culture and has seen once-great institutions—universities, corporations, churches, nonprofit organizations, the media, the military—become engulfed in scandal and politicization.

It is an understatement to say America is struggling to infuse young Americans with a sense of purpose.

Earlier this year, the FBI introduced a [new category of criminal](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/08/us/nihilism-black-pill-concepts-explained): the Nihilistic Violent Extremist, or NVE.

If jihadis kill for Allah, and anti-government extremists like Timothy McVeigh killed in the name of some demented notion of freedom, then [NVEs kill simply because they want to kill](https://gnet-research.org/2025/07/18/meaning-through-its-opposite-significance-quest-theory-and-nihilistic-violent-extremism/). They don’t have much in the way of ideological commitments—as the confusing hodgepodge of aphorisms Westman scrawled into his rifle, pistol, and shotgun makes clear—beyond a commitment to chaos and evil themselves.

“One of the things about online life is it’s very hard to judge scale. Do a thousand people believe this? Or a million? Even all the people on Twitter is very few people.” —political analyst Yuval Levin

Not surprisingly, the Minneapolis shooter [supported the Order of Nine Angles](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/nine-angles-nazi-satanism), a Satanic right-wing group with ties to the “cybercrime collective” 764—the leaders of which were among the first NVEs [arrested by the FBI](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/leaders-764-arrested-and-charged-operating-global-child-exploitation-enterprise), in April.

People like this—people who hunger to sow destruction and death—form a decentralized network of lone wolves spread across screens and feeds and chat rooms across America. Right now, [the FBI is handling](https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-opened-250-investigations-tied-violent-online-network/story?id=121480884) 250 764-related cases in all 55 of its field offices.

“It’s not exactly isolated loners,” conservative political analyst Yuval Levin told me when I asked him recently about the kind of violence that has recently become the norm in this country. (Levin’s books include *[The Fractured Republic: Renewing America’s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-fractured-republic-renewing-america-s-social-contract-in-the-age-of-individualism-yuval-levin/9c4b5a1f55e69ef8?ean=9780465093250&next=t)*.) “It’s little online communities. It feels like you’re in reality. It feels like you’re dealing with something that everybody knows. But, in fact, you’re just getting bombarded with a narrow sliver of the world.”

Levin added: “One of the things about online life is it’s very hard to judge scale. Do a thousand people believe this? Or a million? Even all the people on Twitter is very few people.”

America has a long and tortuous history of political violence.

There was President Lincoln’s assassination and President Garfield’s and President McKinley’s and President Kennedy’s. There was the Civil War. There was the Ku Klux Klan, which lynched thousands of black Americans long after passage of the Fourteenth Amendment.

During the Red Scare of the 1920s, [nativist mobs](https://millercenter.org/president/wilson/the-american-franchise) roughed up immigrants and labor organizers. During the anti-war protests of the 1960s, splinter groups like [the Weather Underground](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/2016/10/26/evading-the-fbi-the-weather-underground-organization/#:~:text=Weatherman%E2%80%94the%20Weather%20Underground%20Organization,post%20office%20in%20the%20country.) firebombed the Capitol, the Pentagon, and the State Department; and [the Symbionese Liberation Army](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Symbionese-Liberation-Army) kidnapped the heiress Patty Hearst; and Charles Manson’s followers murdered the actress Sharon Tate and others with an eye toward instigating a race war.

The late 1960s and 1970s were characterized by fairly regular violence— think of the bombings organized by groups like the Weathermen—that was ostensibly triggered by the Vietnam War and later gave way to a broader assault on American institutions and bourgeois values, as Bryan Burrough observes in his masterful book *[Days of Rage](https://bookshop.org/p/books/days-of-rage-america-s-radical-underground-the-fbi-and-the-forgotten-age-of-revolutionary-violence-bryan-burrough/11706404?ean=9780143107972&next=t)*.

But over the past several years, that violence has morphed into a more amorphous nihilism detached from any clearly defined agenda or principle.

“The kind of person that we’re seeing today,” Martin Gurri, the author of *[The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781732265141)*, told me, “is not promoting a cause.”

He added that they were propelled by a general, wide-ranging fury.

“The sources of meaning that made you feel satisfied with your life are drying up,” Gurri said. “Religion is drying up, community is drying up, family is disintegrating.”

He had in mind people like [Vance Boelter](https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/vance-boelter-indicted-murders-melissa-and-mark-hortman-shootings-john-and-yvette-0), 57, accused of murdering Minnesota’s Democratic House Speaker Emerita and her husband and seriously wounding another lawmaker and his wife in June; James Hodgkinson, 66, who shot and nearly killed House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, in June 2017; and Thomas Crooks, 20, who nearly assassinated President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024. Then there was the guy who tried to take out Trump in West Palm Beach in September 2024; the guy accused of the arson attack on Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, in April 2025; the guy who attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband in San Francisco in October 2022; and the guy who flew cross-country to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in Maryland, in June 2022. Most recently, there was the person who carried out the arson attack on New Mexico’s GOP headquarters, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, spray-painting “ICE=KKK” on the side of the building.

Nor has the political violence, of late, been confined to the politicians.

Luigi Mangione allegedly killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson because he objected to the U.S. healthcare system’s inequities. Elias Rodriguez allegedly murdered the young couple Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim because he believed they were Jews—and, really, Zionists. Joseph Czuba [fatally stabbed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjew8p8l2lgo) the 6-year-old boy Wadee Alfayoumi because he was a Muslim. Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly threw a fatal Molotov cocktail at Karen Diamond, 82, during a pro-hostage demonstration in Colorado, because she wants Hamas to free the hostages.

“It’s a very upsetting part of the political process that’s gotten worse,” Scalise, now House majority leader, told me.

Yes. But why now?

The partisans mostly blame the other side.

When I asked Scalise what prompted his shooting, six months after Trump was sworn into the Oval Office for the first time, Scalise said, “There was a lot of rhetoric coming from the left that triggered, so to speak, the violence.”

Democrats were just as convinced that it was Republicans who had ignited the current wave of bloodshed.

“I think of the real launch of organized fascist street violence as taking place at the ‘Unite the Right’ Rally in August of 2017 in Charlottesville,” Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin emailed me when I posed the same question I had asked Scalise. “The insurrectionists began with a torch-lit Friday night march in front of the local synagogue, with neo-Nazis chanting ‘Jews will not replace us.’ ”

But none of that gets to the problem behind the problem, which is why so many Americans have become so susceptible to the void.

Levin, the conservative political analyst, suggested our fragmented sense of national identity was a function of the new digital culture.

“I had that sense watching the January 6 riot,” Levin told me. “It was clear that people were acting out a very developed conception that had been built up online”—a conception that mimicked reality but was disconnected from it. For example, the idea of a deep state: If you believed in it, the algorithm encouraged and deepened that belief by filling your feed with other voices and video clips that confirmed what you already knew (or “knew”).

“I think you see this, more recently, in the attacks in Minnesota and the attack on the [governor of Pennsylvania](https://www.thefp.com/p/sen-dave-mccormick-arson-attack-on-josh-shapiro-residence),” Levin said.

All this was a sign of a deeply “unhealthy society,” Gurri said.

The biggest problem, he explained, was the breakdown in the compact between the elites and everyone else.

He pointed to the 20th-century Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset, who argued in *[The Revolt of the Masses](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780393310955)* that elites need the public to follow them, and the public needs elites to run our institutions.

“If elites do their job, you will have a healthy society,” Gurri said.

But our elites have failed. They failed with their handling of Covid. They failed over and over to mitigate the most destabilizing aspects of globalization. And they failed, above all, to protect our institutions—standing by as our universities turned into activist farms, and then as those activists took control of our legacy-media behemoths, philanthropies, and HR departments. They had transformed the culture.

“If you watch the old movie from the 1940s *[Young Tom Edison](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033289/)*, he is completely glorified, and then you watch the 2010 Mark Zuckerberg movie, *[The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1)*, and he’s just an asshole who happens to luck into this. That’s nihilistic,” Gurri said. “Both of them are geniuses, and both of them were assholes. So it depends on which part you want to focus on. In a healthy society, we focus on the genius part, and in an unhealthy society, we focus on the asshole part.”

With Robin Westman, there was no ambivalence. Or, at least, none that you could make out in the shooter’s 11-minute video.

The footage opens with a gasping sound—Westman, apparently, half-breathing, half-laughing at nothing in particular—while the camera is trained on the logo from the hit series *Breaking Bad*: a silhouette of a man in a black porkpie hat and shades.

There’s no story here, no explanation for what Westman is about to do.

It’s more a winding mash-up of words and allusions: “WACO,” “KILL PEDOS,” “This is Real!,” “Hail Breivik”—an apparent nod to [Anders Behring Breivik](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/01/world/europe/anders-behring-breivik-norway-parole.html), the Norwegian man who gunned down 69 people at a summer camp for left-wing political activists, in 2011. Plus: “Where Is Your God?” and “Suck On This!” and a magazine with “For The Children” scrawled on it, and below that, several lines of “HAHAHAHAHA,” with Westman mostly talking or humming or singing: “Tomorrow,” from the hit musical and movie *Annie*, and REM’s “It’s the End of the World As We Know It.” And Westman half-talking, half-whispering in Russian or with a Cockney accent.

If Hollywood were to make a movie that went inside the head of a mass murderer, this would be the movie. The tone, the language, the solipsistic wandering through a bedroom or closet or hallway, perusing the weapons the shooter will soon unleash on the children praying in church—it makes the blood run cold.

Toward the end, Westman picks up a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “Let’s Do This Before The Anxiety Kicks In,” and then saunters back towards his bed.

On it, among other weapons, is a pistol with the words “Vicki Weaver” written on it—Vicki was the wife of white separatist Randy Weaver; she was killed in the shoot-out with the feds at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992.

Westman picks up a handgun and turns it toward the camera, his face, and we hear two soft-pedalled *pops!*, and then the screen goes black, and THANK YOU FOR WATCHING comes on. A synth-pop tune plays in the background.
