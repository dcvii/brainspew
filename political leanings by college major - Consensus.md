	## Political Leanings by College Major: Patterns and Influences in Higher Education
	The relationship between college major and political orientation has been widely discussed, with common perceptions suggesting that certain fields lean more liberal or conservative. Research indicates that while some majors are associated with distinct political leanings, the causes are complex and often involve both self-selection and socialization processes.
	
	## Patterns of Political Leanings by Major
	Studies consistently find that students in fields like economics, law, and business tend to be more right-leaning or conservative, while those in political science, mass media, and the humanities are more left-leaning or liberal . For example, Czech university students in economics and law reported more right-wing orientations compared to their peers in political science and media studies . Among faculty, most disciplines are overwhelmingly liberal except for agriculture, which shows a more conservative profile .

	## Mechanisms: Self-Selection vs. Socialization
	Evidence suggests that students often choose majors aligning with their pre-existing political beliefs (self-selection), rather than being significantly influenced by their field of study (socialization) . For instance, longitudinal studies in the Netherlands and Switzerland found little to no causal effect of major on political ideology after controlling for background factors . Peer effects, such as influence from roommates, can modestly shift studentsâ€™ political views, but the overall effect of college on making students more liberal is limited .
	
	## Faculty and Political Diversity
	Faculty in most disciplines, especially the humanities and social sciences, report overwhelmingly liberal orientations, with conservatives being a small minority and experiencing more perceived hostility . This lack of political diversity is often attributed to both self-selection and the social environment within academia.

	## Summary
	Political leanings do vary by college major, with business, law, and agriculture tending more conservative, and humanities, social sciences, and media more liberal. However, these differences are largely due to self-selection rather than the direct influence of academic content. Faculty political orientations mirror these trends, with most fields being predominantly liberal except for a few exceptions. Overall, the impact of college major on political ideology is nuanced and shaped by multiple factors.
