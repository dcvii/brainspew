### Boxtag 060 - Lurkers, Scribbling & Proxy

There are three edge cases to end of life exits of a named member on Boxtag.

The first is **lurking**. A member may choose to go dark or participate at a low level with a limited number of weigh-ins on a comment. If they volunteer to do so, it should be indicated in their profile and perhaps visually with their visible votes / weigh-ins on comments. Six months is a reasonable period for them to be inactive without changing their status. Lurking periods may be recorded if it can be done efficiently.

The second is **proxy**. A proxy is a high level change of ownership of the member. In order to preserve the anonymity of someone who wishes to disown their prior comments and votes, they may elect to proxy to an anonymous identity. In this case, in order to preserve the integrity of conversations, the ownership of those comments and votes is turned over to the system. An anonymized account is given as the pseudonym of the member and all PII associated with the original member is erased and delinked. While someone might make a screenshot of an original comment or a person might become notorious for a comment attributed to them before the proxy, the system will not allow that to be proven.

The final is the **scribble**. A scribble essentially is a non-reversible disconnection of OPs, comments and votes from their contexts. (Votes? box-votes? ). In the case of a scribble, the original content will be preserved, but all comments are delinked from OPs and votes given and received are deactivated from tallies. Essentially the system will have to recalculate the dimensional scores of all entities. This recalculation is something done regularly so those associated with scribbling should not be taxing on the system.

### Boxtag Idea #059 - Highlights

Hat tip to Alok on this piece. This feature is all about parsing through the text of a comment or an OP that allows a critic / commenter to be more specific about his votes in the Boxtag. It should work like the highlighting function of the Kindle app that allows that. It makes sense that extended annotations can generate new content and that can be established in a proper UI. However there should be some limit. I'm happy to make the limit along the lines of whatever it might have been in Nelson's Xanadu.

It occurs to me as I visualize that the inheritance of 'subtexts' can be navigated through on a left-side panel which resembles the pages of a PDF file as a multipart entity. The way this displays in Mac Preview (several versions up to and including Big Sur) is illustrative. So the new OP, which is a comment, displays front and center. Annotations are on the right-side panel and mousing over them highlights the highlighted text. This would be similar to how such annotations are done in Google Docs. The point is that we extend the critical range beyond the OP into the comments. But we also extend the critical range of the OP itself by allowing people to highlight its strong, weak and off-topic points.

### Boxtag Idea #058 - The Greylist

I just attended the Bellingcat / Persuasion / RDI webcast and a perfect extension to Boxtag occurred to me. Right now I'll call it the greylist.

There's a battle against ad spam and spam in general. But right now the corpuses built are strictly black and white. How about a greylist? What if we added Boxtag karma components to OPs and comments and attached those metadata to corpuses of email addresses? Well that's the basic idea. This means that there needs to be a backlink to certifiably credible documents in some evidentiary chain, but once this is established it would only grow. The first customer for this will be organizations like Bellingcat, but also the circle of independent journalists and NGOs and ex-officio individuals associated with doing all of this.

A good model might be a different way of parsing out IMDB as a test corpus. I've done it many times - you look to find what movies a particular star, or even a particular second unit director is associated with. Wouldn't it be cool to do the same thing by adding their critics into the mix. Well David Denby said X about this film. An easy tangent would be to connect these up to Golden Globe and Academy Awards. So that's the basic idea. Expand the reach of Boxtag karma components to various corpuses and establish gradations of credibility that reach beyond a single website's comment section and trace back to registered dimensions. (Ultimately these registered dimensions will be the IP, rather like Pantone registers colors. We can have many shades of the dimensions of credibility and interest).

### Boxtag Idea #057

These days I am doing double duty, reaching out to individuals through Clubhouse and Lunchclub to extend my reach surrounding the subjects of the Logos Project as well as my daily duties for Full 360. I have been pleased with the reception, from polite to enthusiastic, I have received for various aspects of Logos. One person has gotten deep into the current (raggedy) state of prototyping for XRepublic and several have considered the implications for Boxtag. But I have to give full marks to Sumeet R. for recognizing something about Boxtag that I never considered.

I'll get more into Boxtag as time goes by for those who don't know it beyond the idea of 'multidimensional karma for comments' over time. As much as I'd like to spend my early retirement building the entire thing myself, various economic dislocations and personal miscalculations have made early retirement a diminishing possibility. So I'm being as open as someone non-famous can be. Thus the revival of Cubegeek and the upcoming establishment of the Logos Group however small it may be. Never underestimate the power of one man and twelve disciples.

At any rate, Sumeet related a story about the difficulties with meta-moderation at StackOverflow, with some note about how a subject may be answered and the frozen, or some response might be considered out of bounds. Whether or not Boxtag was originally implemented at StackOverflow, it can be implemented in retrospect which allows meta-moderation over and along with the original one dimensional karma system. Boxtag itself will offer incentives for postfacto meta-moderation in a way 'similar' to that of Wikipedia so that subjects that are considered 'dead' may come to life once again. This will be especially useful in **solving the oracle problem**. It can be crowdsourced if meta-moderation is done right. We think Boxtag will be meta-moderation done right.

Thanks Sumeet. You're brilliant.

### Revival

It has been a while. I will update Cubegeek as I continue doing mealy-mouthed development and discoveries like those reaction videos. Ooh look what's so cool about the Rust compiler. So anyway. This is newly dedicated to the people I am reaching out to in order to get any traction possible for my Logos Projects - as long as it takes for that to happen.

What's going on these days? My company has pivoted from primarily managed services to product + professional services. This allows us to consider more customers despite the fact that we are picky and competitive. The good news is that we've passed our latest ISO 27K audit with sprinting colors (they weren't quite flying but they set an admirable pace.) This means we can indeed take on a more significant class of customers as we've always wanted to do. BTW this is our third years passing. For me that means more work in the columnar space. Since MFGP just signed an agreement with AWS, stuff can start popping (including the stock). That means it will be great for me to get back deep into the internals of Vertica, as I did in 2012, and help workloads scream.

On the Logos front, I've enjoyed the reactions I've gotten from the folks I talk to, and I'm encouraged to push forward. So I need to do a bit more drawing on UI and perhaps as I become fluent in React, while it's still relevant, I can make a shell around my database models. Or maybe I'll stick to the database models. As we move forward with eDW and integrate **Singer** and **dbt**, stuff will go a lot faster. So I aim to put up something at least once a week here. That will keep me focused.
