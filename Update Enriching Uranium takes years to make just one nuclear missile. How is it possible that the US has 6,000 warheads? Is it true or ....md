The United States does not have 6,000 active warheads. It's closer to 3,700. And while enriching uranium is hard work, the idea that one bomb takes years is wrong if the will is there. The truth is the arsenal is a ghost of the Cold War -- During that time, America did not build one bomb at a time. It built a colossal industrial machine to make them by the thousands. At places like Oak Ridge in Tennessee and the Hanford Site in Washington. Entire cities were dedicated to this one task. They ran massive plants for enriching uranium and special nuclear reactors for breeding plutonium, a different path to the same end. At its peak, the U.S. had over 30,000 warheads. The current stockpile is what remains from that fever - The factories are quiet now.

Everyone's missing the important point: the US uses plutonium, not uranium, except for a handful of backpack tactical nukes. Enriching plutonium is easy because it's chemically distinct from uranium and easy to separate (whereas U235 is chemically identical to U238, and not even 2% different in mass‚Ä¶

None of the reactors used at Hanford for plutonium production were breeder reactors. They (100-B the first, 100-C, 100-D, 100-DR, 100-F, 100-H, 100KE, 100-KW and 100-N) were all graphite moderated fission reactors. The only breeder reactor built on the Hanford Site was the FFTF (Fast Flux Test Facil‚Ä¶

Agreed, they weren't dedicated breeder designs, but they were making plutonium out of the U238 in the low-enriched uranium of the fuel rods, that was later recovered. And it was the plutonium that was used for most of the US nuclear arsenal.[Daniel in the Lion's Den](https://www.quora.com/profile/Daniel-in-the-Lions-Den-3)

Not to mention you can have multiple instances of uranium enrichment occurring simultaneously. If one set of machinery takes a year to enrich enough for a bomb, you wouldn't take 3,000 years to make 3,000 bombs, you would have 3,000 sets of equipment taking 1 year to make 3,000 bombs.[Travis Martin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Travis-Martin-493)

Maybe more like 1,000 sets making one bomb a year for three years, realistically.[Kevin Rooney](https://www.quora.com/profile/Kevin-Rooney-56)

Haha the same thinking when making parts on the painfully slow 3d printers, they are getting better now though.

Plutonium makes better bombs. It is easier to make plutonium than it is to separate U235 from U238. You can also have more efficient devices with tritium boosting. Less fissionable material is required.[Handyman Dave](https://www.quora.com/profile/Handyman-Dave-1)
