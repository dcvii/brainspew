Tulsi Gabbardâ€™s new interview with Megyn Kelly is going viral.  
  
And sheâ€™s NOT just talking about border security.  
  
She just uncovered a classified intel leak, a buried pandemic link, and a secret fight to stop Trump.  
  
Hereâ€™s what you should know (before this story disappears): ðŸ§µ

It began with a strategic intelligence leak to The Washington Post.  
  
Classified information about border enforcement was selectively released.  
  
Critical context about Venezuela's role was deliberately omitted from what the public saw.  
  
This wasn't accidental - it was calculated...<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321697352237064/pl/8tTXe2jD5tQOUG1p.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=84a&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321697352237064/vid/avc1/480x270/OheNLtj9G7S8GzZE.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321697352237064/vid/avc1/640x360/sofVzio2Z3EtCJy_.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321697352237064/vid/avc1/1280x720/U62mZdgQFOY-yH05.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Gabbard described how it happened:  
  
Officials cherry-picked parts of a 6-page intelligence document on Venezuela's Tren Aragua gang.  
  
They excluded FBI confirmation that Venezuela's government supports the gang's US operations.  
  
This selective disclosure had a purpose. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321753291669505/pl/UwdZsALTGYjuVnFG.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=0e8&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321753291669505/vid/avc1/480x270/ypRVEhcH9Y28FCGg.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321753291669505/vid/avc1/640x360/r9viBl671lcjlw6X.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321753291669505/vid/avc1/1280x720/OypFl_7_S1stWvoH.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

This isn't the first time intelligence has been weaponized.  
  
Remember the "Russia collusion" narrative?  
  
The "Hunter Biden laptop is Russian disinformation" letter?  
  
Each example follows the same playbook: selective leaks to shape public opinion and policy.

Gabbard's response marks a historic shift:  
  
Three criminal referrals to DOJ, eleven more investigations underway.  
  
More significant: She's documenting systematic abuses so reforms can be implemented that survive beyond any single administration. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321814448816130/pl/Vgm-IIuwi5r3Fp55.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=902&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321814448816130/vid/avc1/480x270/qZ7FVEloqhGkUAKQ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321814448816130/vid/avc1/640x360/S-LyXMaiArnx_Hsh.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321814448816130/vid/avc1/1280x720/CWbSwhn1oj3t41YM.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

The COVID revelations are even more significant.  
  
Gabbard established a "Director's Initiative Group" with a specific mission:  
Investigate pandemic origins thoroughly.  
  
Their findings connect to US government funding decisions. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321856366690305/pl/EHO4rl2t5cqs9tiS.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=787&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321856366690305/vid/avc1/480x270/aFK9jzQZDQeMypDD.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321856366690305/vid/avc1/640x360/YHCzUD9djZpNJPlR.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321856366690305/vid/avc1/1280x720/uvxNKxHTfINKCnLJ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

What they uncovered:  
  
US taxpayer dollars funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab.  
This research likely created COVID-19.  
  
Meanwhile, Fauci repeatedly denied this connection under oath to Congress. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321903598747651/pl/dJOmHKJsPeDs4ktp.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=10b&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321903598747651/vid/avc1/480x270/e9a5lcRu0QVtH6fQ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321903598747651/vid/avc1/640x360/BZOzdQjiG-TvRKqv.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321903598747651/vid/avc1/1280x720/D8SKdu7cj5ZznSXy.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Consider the scale of this cover-up:  
  
Fauci sought a "preemptive pardon" before leaving office.  
Scientists questioning the natural origin theory were systematically smeared.  
Intelligence assessments were altered to support the preferred narrative.  
  
Truth became a casualty of bureaucratic self-preservation.<video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321940554829824/pl/mAzD2Nef7NTi0QZt.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=398&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321940554829824/vid/avc1/480x270/OTqjoXF6Tvc7GKJB.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321940554829824/vid/avc1/640x360/sXgVx7y1oPzSbO0h.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321940554829824/vid/avc1/1280x720/M0aQCcIYqD74zfov.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

When intelligence agencies become political actors, accountability vanishes.  
  
We've seen this pattern throughout history â€“ from the Church Committee revelations to the Iraq WMD intelligence failure.  
  
The consequences? Policy disasters and eroded public trust.

The resistance to Trump goes beyond isolated incidents:  
  
"They are very unwilling to come to a view or express an opinion on some things, but in other cases, they quickly come to assumptions without evidence."  
  
This pattern affects critical security decisions. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321997559508992/pl/ntW5sbxVBgwPu5Lw.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=d17&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321997559508992/vid/avc1/480x270/3m5lbbC4BOh-nqBr.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321997559508992/vid/avc1/640x360/v9HxAHfXwBvSr4_e.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918321997559508992/vid/avc1/1280x720/O9zttgExt3YW71FC.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

A clear example:  
  
When Trump declared Tren Aragua gang an "incursion" justifying deportations, officials leaked claims that no Venezuela connection existed.  
  
But they deliberately concealed FBI evidence confirming that exact relationship.

The pattern extends throughout the system:  
  
Intelligence briefings to Congress often contained information "already read about in the newspaper."  
  
Important security decisions undermined through selective leaks.  
  
A systematic effort against elected leadership. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322053595447298/pl/hTOhL1FQf4lxZsp5.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322053595447298/vid/avc1/480x270/9vM_xiV1A2ajSsqI.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322053595447298/vid/avc1/640x360/bF2-PlOM7sFNePYQ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322053595447298/vid/avc1/1280x720/Yal80d-dHWPxNE9w.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Meanwhile, Gabbard discovered resources being diverted:  
  
Intelligence analysts required to spend half their workday on DEI initiatives to get promotions.  
  
$170 million allocated to DEI programs she's now redirecting toward security priorities. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322114278707200/pl/O10xQ7v44amsLg4u.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322114278707200/vid/avc1/480x270/v4Fw2KVGKcQEjP0m.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322114278707200/vid/avc1/640x360/erVOBfitYgGGL0Xl.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322114278707200/vid/avc1/1280x720/AntrSnYaNqeetLCG.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

One particularly concerning example:  
  
An NSA chat group discussing explicit sexual content operated for over two years.  
  
When whistleblowers reported it, they were silenced by DEI policies.  
"Filed a written report with evidence...and basically told, 'Shut up.'" <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322185057501184/pl/32CwjLb4PMVprrVO.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322185057501184/vid/avc1/480x270/VLa6x6ekveUP9gmL.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322185057501184/vid/avc1/640x360/N5SlFSDnsa-jndtA.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918322185057501184/vid/avc1/1280x720/J98jLbT8yD53hoVu.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

The evidence points to a consistent pattern:  
  
A government operating within the government.  
Intelligence manipulated for partisan purposes.  
Whistleblowers silenced.  
  
Presidential policies systematically undermined.  
  
As Gabbard said: "They are actually undermining our democracy."

The ultimate insight from Gabbard's revelations?  
  
Our national security apparatus requires a complete cultural reset.  
  
As she put it: "This speaks to the huge culture shift, the mindset shift that has to take place here."  
  
A return to mission, accountability, and public service.

## More from @karlmehta

President Trump just hosted a high-stakes cabinet meeting at the White House.  
  
One by one, top Cabinet members delivered Major Announcements â€” directly reporting to the American people.  
  
Hereâ€™s everything you should know (and no joke, it gets crazier the further you read): ðŸ§µ

1/ Trump:  
  
Consumer prices dropping, energy costs down, country making $8T from tariffs.  
  
"We've achieved the most secure border in American historyâ€”99.9% secure."  
  
"We're fixing trade deals that should've been addressed decades ago." <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917919456535388160/pl/kr-aHTQn60goPCc7.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=d7d&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917919456535388160/vid/avc1/480x270/YM_B4ypT18MJVld2.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917919456535388160/vid/avc1/640x360/GSGW6hMYo2YrsTj5.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917919456535388160/vid/avc1/1280x720/KACqSVvow6Bz8FH2.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

2/ Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth:  
  
Military recruitment is seeing a "renaissance" after years of decline.  
  
"We've ripped wokeness out of the military."  
  
We have 11,000 troops at the border with power to detain migrants. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917919551775555584/pl/00wDbHy-omqKG4XI.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=cfc&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917919551775555584/vid/avc1/480x270/gt5FtJ2z17qINa2j.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917919551775555584/vid/avc1/640x360/-TveZUXnpMSt_020.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917919551775555584/vid/avc1/1280x720/FHbHbP_iWH5nWxFl.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Sec. of State Marco Rubioâ€™s new interview just went viral.  
  
And he's NOT talking about tariffs or China.  
  
He exposed a secret $50M shadow agency inside the State Department that tried to silence Americans...  
  
Hereâ€™s what you should know (& how they tried to erase free speech): ðŸ§µ

It all started innocently enough 10-15 years ago.  
  
The State Department created a program to counter terrorist messaging from al-Qaida and ISIS.  
  
Who could argue with that?  
  
But here's where it gets disturbing... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917203899867713536/pl/m35XQDbx2nQqYIiz.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917203899867713536/vid/avc1/480x270/q_F6crMoDTYFN3U8.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917203899867713536/vid/avc1/640x360/TkH2nN2HRBdsFpWD.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917203899867713536/vid/avc1/1280x720/sJ9jRWkCXmWHnlYI.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

After the 2016 election, the program's focus shifted to targeting "foreign interference" in elections.  
  
By 2020, it had morphed into something far more sinister:  
  
A government-funded operation targeting individual American voices. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917203957547782144/pl/FMSvY6egpBJwj1XY.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=2f4&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917203957547782144/vid/avc1/480x270/zDS1l_RN3sSy3PZR.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917203957547782144/vid/avc1/640x360/uGdpWM6pFQkkjzoZ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917203957547782144/vid/avc1/1280x720/tYsg10x8cd6NVz6A.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

This man can predict the future:  
  
In 2012, Geoffrey Hinton claimed machines would soon learn like humans.  
  
Everyone ignored him.  
  
By 2023, ChatGPT replaced 200M+ jobs and AI investment hit $120B.  
  
Hereâ€™s his latest warning (& why the world listens when he speaks):ðŸ§µ  

In 2022, Geoffrey Hinton was Google's top AI scientist with full access to their most advanced systems.  
  
Then suddenly, he resigned.  
  
Why? He needed freedom to warn humanity about what's coming.  
  
The warning signs were already clear to him. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916847430878040064/pl/YxemChZZG0hvk2B0.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916847430878040064/vid/avc1/480x270/0blv7VkbrIHPB05_.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916847430878040064/vid/avc1/640x360/Qf082kt8Z6ODWcro.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916847430878040064/vid/avc1/1280x720/QK0RYM09AtwMa9Es.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Hinton's authority is unmatched:  
  
â€¢ 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics  
â€¢ Created the neural networks powering ALL modern AI  
â€¢ Known as the "Godfather of AI" for 30+ years of breakthroughs  
â€¢ Accurate predictions dating back decades  
  
When Hinton speaks about AI risks, people listen. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916847482451230720/pl/I3CdIVNVQhkowW0H.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916847482451230720/vid/avc1/480x270/wAmtR_PRRsl-BMr8.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916847482451230720/vid/avc1/640x360/ravjuxPWG7wZtfwI.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916847482451230720/vid/avc1/1280x720/ZfcRRErG0_dMtDWd.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

This is Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong.  
  
Heâ€™s a surgeon whoâ€™s dedicated 50+ years to researching cancer.  
  
His message? Cancer isnâ€™t bad genes or random mutationsâ€”itâ€™s your immune system failing.  
  
This changes everything youâ€™ve been told about how to fight & prevent cancer: ðŸ§µ  

1/ Cancer rates are rising alarmingly  
  
â€¢ Soon-Shiong sees 13-year-olds with pancreatic cancer  
â€¢ Colleagues report 8-11-year-olds with colon cancer  
â€¢ Young adults with aggressive cancers  
â€¢ Cases showing "turbo-charged" progression  
  
But why is that? <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916115172340731907/pl/cjWDPqQ6sXSYWiaa.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=333&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916115172340731907/vid/avc1/480x270/tVkP4s-qS8m1huTB.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916115172340731907/vid/avc1/640x360/KPJm0RzgMEm5JbBk.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916115172340731907/vid/avc1/1280x720/E3S0b3o8Kj_80nwR.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

2/ For decades, oncology has operated on the premise:  
  
"Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease."

RFK Jr. just forced the food industry to confront its darkest secret.  
  
They officially banned food dyes, chemicals that have been poisoning Americans for decades.  
  
Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s changing, whatâ€™s been kept from you until now, and how it could impact every meal you eat:  
  
ThreadðŸ§µ

FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty McCary:  
  
For the last 50 years, American children have been living in "a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals."  
  
The FDA is now removing ALL petroleum-based food dyes from the US food supply and medications.  
  
This is a massive shift in food policy. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915376699937898497/pl/4C4U20feJ-h8WGSF.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915376699937898497/vid/avc1/480x270/VyiBqgnTw1H16VAH.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915376699937898497/vid/avc1/640x360/Wye_DJHdRyi8HVrL.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915376699937898497/vid/avc1/1280x720/Ww7sNx_Rk2WGJzgB.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

In the 1960s, only 3% of American children had chronic disease.  
  
Today, that figure is around 60%.  
  
That explosion in chronic illness correlates with the introduction of these synthetic additives. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915376797648379906/pl/ye1Pp2p9ApPVvdjl.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=377&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915376797648379906/vid/avc1/480x270/uFmhFYbK_KgWstAR.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915376797648379906/vid/avc1/640x360/dxXy_ZXYyvg7ryvJ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915376797648379906/vid/avc1/1280x720/ddbwzWK9meGaFdml.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

This is Demis Hassabis.  
  
Heâ€™s Google's DeepMind CEO, whoâ€™s studied AI for 30+ years.  
  
In his new interview with 60 Minutes, he revealed mind-blowing facts about health & AI that 99% of people wouldnâ€™t know.  
  
Here are my top 8 takeaways: ðŸ§µ  
(No. 6 will shock you)

1/ Human-Level AI Timeline Accelerated  
  
Hassabis predicts Artificial General Intelligence by 2030-2035.  
  
This isn't faster computingâ€”it's AI that has all the capabilities that humans have.  
  
The acceleration means we have much less time to prepare. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915042320996773888/pl/0j1qhR0Zz1g8AANj.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915042320996773888/vid/avc1/480x270/23toPLjRLwjFJ-f-.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915042320996773888/vid/avc1/640x360/m2Am3RZ9PoFYK-af.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915042320996773888/vid/avc1/1280x720/RGS4HI-cu0ZbVSDj.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

2/ "Radical Abundance"  
  
Hassabis' biggest revelation: AI will eliminate scarcity.  
  
Resources limited today won't be tomorrow.  
  
This transforms healthcare, energy, food, and economics.  
  
The end of scarcity within our lifetime. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915042449556480001/pl/c5bhdbRmbxpRJZWZ.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915042449556480001/vid/avc1/480x270/ViXwLdilOLKbBw9Y.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915042449556480001/vid/avc1/640x360/nQOAjviBK3zpJNBh.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915042449556480001/vid/avc1/1280x720/__z0oP-mIsSUeQSr.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>
