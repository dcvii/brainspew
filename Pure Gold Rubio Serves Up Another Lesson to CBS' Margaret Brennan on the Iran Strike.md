Early Sunday morning, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine laid out some of the details of Saturday's "Operation Midnight Hammer" to wipe out three of Iran's nuclear sites. It involved deception, precision timing, great operational security, and the element of surprise. Perhaps most importantly, it appears to have been a rousing success and our military all got out safely after completing their mission.

All three facilities were hit within a 25-minute window and our forces weren't even fired on, on the way in or on the way out, which is pretty amazing.

Other members of the team made the rounds of the Sunday shows to explain and answer questions about President Donald Trump's decision to wipe out three of Iran's nuclear sites on Saturday night. We [reported](https://redstate.com/wardclark/2025/06/22/vice-president-vance-on-iran-we-actually-want-peace-n2190761) on how Vice President JD Vance explained on "Meet the Press" how we want peace, but peace within the context of Iran not having a nuclear weapon.

Perhaps the most ridiculous media questioning of the morning goes to who else but "Face the Nation" host Margaret Brennan. Secretary of State Marco Rubio schooled her, big time, on who might know the facts and the policy, Brennan or him, when she kept getting up in his face. Notice how she also refers to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the "Supreme Leader." She claimed the key point was whether Khamenei had ordered weaponization.

"No, it's not," Rubio educated her. 'I know that better than you know that, and I know that's not the case."

He said it didn't matter "if the order was given," if they had everything they needed to make nuclear weapons.

"Why do they have 60 percent enriched uranium?" Rubio had to explain to her.

"The only countries in the world that have uranium at 60 percent are countries that have nuclear weapons because they can quickly make it 90 percent."

Brennan started talking about the "intelligence assessment." He scoffed at that: "How do you know what the intelligence assessment said?"

The bottom line, Rubio said, is that they were enriching uranium well beyond anything you need for a civil nuclear program. Why would you enrich it at 60 percent unless you wanted to take it to 90 to build a weapon, he pointed out again. "Why are you developing ICBMs?" He explained they had everything they needed. "They have the delivery mechanisms, the enrichment capability, the highly enriched uranium that is stored - that's all we need to see," he said, also noting their terrorism and being a force of evil in the region.

Brennan appeared to cave to this obvious logic, admitting, "No one is disputing that here." She claimed all she was asking was if there was a weaponization order.

Rubio again noted that the important thing was "we had intelligence that they had everything they needed to build a nuclear weapon."

It's so funny that she's so bad at this, even initially wagging her finger at him as if she knew more than he did about the intelligence.

The Trump team seems to keep schooling Brennan and she keeps putting herself in this position.
