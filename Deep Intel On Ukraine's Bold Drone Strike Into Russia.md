### JUST POSTED: June 11, 2025

We invited 2-time Moochie award winner [Justin Bronk](https://www.rusi.org/people/bronk) to explore the recent Ukrainian drone strike deep within Russian territory, targeting critical strategic bombers like the TU-95s and TU-22s. These operations highlight the nation's ingenuity and operational reach without direct foreign intervention. The attacks hold profound political weight, signaling Ukraine's burgeoning asymmetric capabilities and peak strategic improvisation as both sides sit down at the negotiating table.

The ramifications of these strikes go beyond immediate military loss. They underscore the vulnerabilities shared by Western air bases, urging a reassessment of defense postures against similar threats. This operational awareness is crucial as adversaries like Russia leverage conventional and nuclear assets amid geopolitical tensions. For Western forces, itâ€™s a rallying call to bolster internal security measures, emphasizing intelligence coordination and strategic defense infrastructure.
