Police in Dundee, [Scotland](https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-scotland-makes-it-easier-for-men-to-legally-become-women) have charged a 14-year-old girl after officers responded to reports of a youth carrying a bladed weapon on Saturday evening. Emergency services were called to St Ann Lane at approximately 7:40 pm following reports of a girl in possession of the weapon, reports [STV News.](https://news.stv.tv/north/girl-14-charged-after-allegedly-being-found-with-bladed-weapon-in-dundee)

In a video of the incident, a man with a foreign accent is filming and approaches two girls, repeatedly telling her to “show the knife.” It also shows the girl holding a hatchet or axe looking very upset at the man's presence. One of the girls can be heard yelling to the man to not get close. "Don't touch little my sister, she's f\*cking twelve," the girl says.  
  

  
  
A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “Around 7.40 pm on Saturday, we received a report of a female youth with a bladed weapon in St Ann Lane, Dundee. Officers attended and a 14-year-old girl was charged in connection. She will be reported to the relevant authorities.” There was no mention of the man.  
  
Reaction to the video on X has been mostly in favor of the girls. Some users noted that the video doesn't tell the whole story. "That little girl has more balls than most of the 'men' in the UK... combined. Where are the men?" [said one user.](https://x.com/WitCoHE_Bak/status/1960011847718895866) "He kept coming towards them in spite of her screaming to leave them alone. When do we see him moving away? When she shows him that she is not defenseless," another [noted](https://x.com/MmeHuckleberry/status/1959934265342185509).  
  
"This brave little girl is the type of refugee I want coming to America," Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said. "I can’t comprehend what type of government won’t protect her and refuses to stamp out the mass rapings."  
  

Statistics show that homicides involving sharp instruments decreased from 57 in 2008–09 to 28 in 2023–24. Hospital admissions linked to knife assaults have also fallen over the same period. Knife crime in Scotland [has dropped](https://theferret.scot/claim-knife-crime-has-reduced-is-half-true) over the past 15 years, but police and community leaders warn of a resurgence in incidents involving young people.

Despite that progress, [police data indicates](https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/knife-crime-young-people-statistic-scotland-b2762110.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) more recent increases in knife possession and use among minors. In 2024 alone, 91 under-18s were caught carrying bladed weapons—an average of one every four days—with some cases involving children as young as 10.
