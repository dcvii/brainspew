[Ford Motor](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/F) has suspended a worker who heckled President Trump during a tour of a Michigan truck factory on Tuesday.

T.J. Sabula shouted out “pedophile protector” as Trump walked past. Trump visited the plant to tout efforts to bolster U.S. auto manufacturing. The president responded by pointing and raising his middle finger, according to a video posted online of the interaction.

The suspension is the latest reminder of the limitations of speech in the workplace, where employers—including [tech giants such as Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/workplace-employee-activism-company-response-7ef095f6?mod=article_inline) as well as [retailer Office Depot](https://www.wsj.com/business/charlie-kirk-office-depot-workers-politics-7dbc52ab?mod=article_inline) —have taken action against employees who took political stands on the job.

Most recently, [Hilton](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HLT) cut ties with one property because staff [declined to book rooms](https://www.wsj.com/business/hospitality/hilton-removes-hotel-from-its-system-after-it-refuses-service-to-ice-agents-14ecccbf?mod=article_inline) for federal immigration agents.

Sabula, a 40-year-old line worker, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. After the event, Sabula told the Washington Post that he was about 60 feet from Trump when he yelled out. “Definitely no regrets whatsoever,” he said.

The White House said Trump’s response was appropriate. “A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the president gave an appropriate and unambiguous response,” said Steven Cheung, White House communications director.

Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat who represents a district near Detroit, said she has spoken with Sabula. “He’s rattled. He’s fearful for his family,” the congresswoman said. “I hope the company doesn’t fire him.”

Dingell said it isn’t uncommon for politicians to get heckled on factory floors. “Let’s take a breath,” she said.

Ford declined to discuss Sabula’s status. A spokesman said the company held a successful event with Trump and is proud of how employees represented the company. “One of our core values is respect and we don’t condone anyone saying anything inappropriate like that within our facilities,” he said.
