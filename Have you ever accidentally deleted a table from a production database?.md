No I have not. Well, not accidentally. But I have crashed a production hard drive. This was back in the day when they were the size of a washing machine. It was the most sickening feeling. I opened up the top of the hard drive and was swapping out the drive for the backup. Then I spun up the backup drive, shortly I heard a crackling sound like when your vacuum cleaner picks up coins. It was a total head crash. It was so bad that it ripped the armature out of the servo. So we lost our backup and had to order a new disk pack which took 3 weeks. I took the head assembly and made it into a keychain. It was a rite of passage.

I ran JCL to load and read a tape (long time ago), and it did not run but abended. No reason for that, so I ran it again and got the abend again. About this time, the chief operator called and said the downtown data center called and told me to stop running, since I had broken the tape. Oh my.
