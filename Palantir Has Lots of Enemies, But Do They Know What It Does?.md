“Are they worried I’m too crazy or too evil?” Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir, recently asked me.

He was disarmingly blunt, pacing around his office swinging a tai chi saber over his head.

His question came in response to one I asked about the criticism his company attracts—criticism that has reached a fever pitch over the past several months as Palantir signed a [$10 billion deal](https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract/Article/4262594/) with the U.S. Army and became one of this year’s top-performing stocks.

So what’s the answer to Karp’s question? A bit of both.

The left’s critique of Palantir goes something like this: Palantir is a shadowy company with operations across the globe, working with governments and corporations that give Palantir access to private data, which it uses to achieve whatever its clients ask—ethical concerns be damned. In other words, [these critics say](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/), Palantir uses data collection and aggregation to do things like identify illegal immigrants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or allegedly [kill aid workers in Gaza](https://www.business-humanrights.org/es/%C3%BAltimas-noticias/palantir-allegedly-enables-israels-ai-targeting-amid-israels-war-in-gaza-raising-concerns-over-war-crimes/) with its advanced targeting software.

But it’s not just the political left. Figures on the [woke right](https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-danger-of-the-woke-right-2025-03-02) —conspiracy-theorist entertainers like Nick Fuentes and Candace Owens—have lambasted the company for some of the same reasons, including Palantir’s connections to Israel.

And Republicans who want America to pull back from the world, like Congressmen Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio, have sounded the alarm about the danger of Palantir’s connection to the so-called “ [deep state](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/05/2025/destroy-the-ring-trumps-palantir-deal-alarms-hill-republicans),” pointing to [secretive government contracts](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5372776/palantir-tech-contracts-trump) that they fear will lead to mass surveillance.

Some refuse to put their name next to their criticism, like this Republican aide who [told](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/05/2025/destroy-the-ring-trumps-palantir-deal-alarms-hill-republicans) *[Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/05/2025/destroy-the-ring-trumps-palantir-deal-alarms-hill-republicans)*: “These guys are freaks with no sense of humor and a very disturbing sense of morality—and now they have all the data. Someone should do something.”

But do *what*, exactly?

Many of the critics can’t tell you. Part of the problem is that Palantir is impregnable and hard to understand, fueling the sense that it must be up to something nefarious. Which, in part, may explain why *The New York Times*, in an [article in May](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html), speculated that because Palantir works with multiple government agencies, President Donald Trump might soon be able to “compile a master list of personal information” about every American.

That’s not true, according to Palantir. One executive in its government division told me the accusation of data sharing would be “like saying if the IRS uses Microsoft Excel/Office 365 and the CDC uses Microsoft Excel/Office 365, all of a sudden I have one system and I can see everything in one Excel.”

But the mere possibility of that scenario deepens suspicion. Michael Steinberger, the author of a Karp biography being published [next month](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9781668012956), said that “if you don’t think well of Donald Trump, if you don’t think well of the people around him, if you think that these are people who might abuse personal data, then you’re going to, by extension, be concerned about Palantir. But it’s not a Palantir issue.”

The first question I asked Palantir employees at their office in Washington, D.C., was simple: What do you do for a living?

The answers almost always came back as a metaphor.

One engineer told me to think of Palantir as capable of finding a moving needle in a haystack the size of a small country.

Others [told me](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/03/06/artificial-intelligence-state-of-the-union/) to imagine a series of tangled garden hoses in your backyard, with the hoses representing various pieces of data. If your organization is the U.S. Army, those hoses might represent ammunition sources, troop locations, medical supplies, intel from a spy on the ground, or the signals and behaviors of the enemy. Palantir’s software untangles the hoses and makes sure all of the water is going to and coming from the correct place, so that the general or colonel can make sense of the data as quickly as possible, and make the most informed decision.

“Terror suspects leave patterns that they don’t really realize they’re leaving. At least one U.S. agency reported that hundreds of terror attacks around the world have been stopped with our product.” —Alex Karp

Here is how I described Palantir to my mom, who doesn’t know what a large language model (LLM) is: It is a very advanced data-analysis company. Governments, the military, and big companies give Palantir their information—everything from Post-it notes to satellite images to spreadsheets. In disparate pieces, all that data is overwhelming and hard to make sense of, mostly because those pieces of data aren’t in conversation with each other. Palantir’s software organizes it, connects the dots, and highlights patterns that humans might miss.

In Karp’s words, Palantir’s software “analyzes data and finds hidden patterns.”

The people who work there—“Palantirians,” they call themselves—believe they are saving the world. And many of them believe they are the only people capable of doing so.

The engineers there described themselves to me as “some of the best coders in the world,” “real-world geniuses,” and “the most talented people you’ll ever meet in your life.” They also threw around phrases like “fail forward and leverage your spike” and “artist colony of entrepreneurs.” They call engineers “coding warriors.”

To some people, all that can sound cult-like and self-aggrandizing. To others who believe as Karp does that Palantir is defending the West, it sounds like a culture where people believe in what they are doing. The company’s onboarding program is called “Indoc”—short for indoctrination, though employees swear it’s just a “pretty corporate” orientation. Palantir’s leaders sign their emails with “save the Shire,” a reference to *The Lord of the Rings,* and they call each other “hobbits.”(Palantir itself is named for the [seeing stones](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Palant%C3%ADri) in the J.R.R. Tolkien novel.)

I met a Stanford University graduate in his early 20s with the title “Head of Jagged Failure.” His job, or part of it, is to assure his team of young employees that it’s okay to fail.

If all this seems over the top, consider the fact that it’s hard to explain the mechanics of software that can both help put chicken nuggets in Walmart and help kill [Osama bin Laden](https://www.palantir.com/newsroom/media/lobs3-13-2023/english/). And Palantir can do both.

[

Palantir was founded in 2003 by Alex Karp, Peter Thiel, Joe Lonsdale, Nathan Gettings, and Stephen Cohen. Karp and Thiel were law-school buddies who envisioned a company that could build powerful software to serve the West—especially its intelligence agencies and military. The idea was born in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when U.S. intelligence agencies were criticized for failing to “ [connect the dots](https://www.fbi.gov/history/brief-history/a-new-era-of-national-security#:~:text=Within%20two%20years%2C%20new%20field,could%20have%20never%20done%20before.) ” of the hijackings despite having data that could have—indeed, should have—revealed the plot.

The idea of partnering with the government has long been considered divisive and highly unfashionable in Silicon Valley. In 2018, Google backed out of a Department of Defense contract for Project Maven—the Pentagon’s central artificial intelligence initiative—after thousands of Google employees protested, and a few dozen resigned, petitioning that “Google should not be in the business of war.” Google ultimately acquiesced. Thiel, for his part, [accused Google](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/15/peter-thiel-reportedly-says-the-fbi-and-cia-should-investigate-google.html) of making “the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the U.S. military.”

Palantir was all too happy to step into the breach. In picking up the Maven mantle, Palantir was pilloried as a band of warmongering ideologues in bed with the U.S. government. When news of the contract broke in 2019, one report [compared its software](https://thenextweb.com/news/report-palantir-took-over-project-maven-the-military-ai-program-too-unethical-for-google) to “mustard gas” and “white phosphorus”—a technology so “inhumane” and “unethical” that it shouldn’t be used. (In fact, its software used by the Pentagon is for AI integration in the military.)

That crucial decision has paid off. Palantir’s annual revenue from government customers jumped about 150 percent between [2020](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdf) and [2024](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/d75a90fd-c80a-40bd-b60c-1f5b8c10127e.pdf). In July, the U.S. Army awarded Palantir a deal worth up to [$10 billion](https://www.war.gov/News/Contracts/Contract/Article/4262594/) over the next decade. Within weeks of that deal, the Pentagon expanded Palantir’s role in Project Maven through a contract valued at [$795 million](https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract/Article/4194643/). Since January, Palantir has racked up more than $300 million in new and expanded contracts with agencies ranging from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/health/cdc-data-privacy-palantir.html#:~:text=But%20news%20that%20the%20Trump,redundant%20data%20systems%20and%20tools.%E2%80%9D) and the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/FAA-Selects-Palantir-for-Aircraft-Certification-Safety-Monitoring-Solution/) to the [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html) and [Fannie Mae](https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/fannie-mae-launches-ai-fraud-detection-technology-partnership-palantir).

Now, there are some 4,000 people who work at Palantir in offices around the globe.

Part of the noise around Palantir has nothing to do with its software and more to do with its leader. Karp is no ordinary CEO.

He is half black and half Jewish, and was raised by progressives in Philadelphia who took Karp to civil-rights marches as a young boy. He has a PhD in philosophy from Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Karp, 57, has never been married and complains that bodyguards make it [hard for him to flirt](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/style/alex-karp-palantir.html#:~:text=The%2056%2Dyear%2Dold%20is,crimp%20your%20ability%20to%20flirt.\)). He [doesn’t drive](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/style/alex-karp-palantir.html) because he was “too poor” and then “too rich.” His hair has an [X account](https://x.com/alexkarpshair?lang=en). Last month, Palantir’s online merchandise store began selling T-shirts [printed with Karp’s face](https://x.com/elianoayounes/status/1967914208546504864?s=46) and the word *DOMINATE*. They are now sold out.

Karp, who became CEO in 2005, has [described himself](https://www.businessinsider.com/palantirs-ceo-alex-karp-is-a-self-described-socialist-2018-11) as a socialist. He is also unabashedly pro-West and something of a philosopher king. One colleague likened him to a cross between Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. He walks the floors of the office, striking up conversations with engineers. His curtains, I was told, are only ever drawn when he is changing from his typical ensemble of a white T-shirt and athletic joggers into a suit.

“I’ve been very open about what we stand for,” Karp told me. “We’re pro-West. For us, the West is led by America, but also includes allies, including Israel.”

In April at the Hill & Valley Forum, a conference focused on combating China’s influence on the U.S. technology industry, a protester interrupted Karp’s interview, yelling that “Palantir kills Palestinians with their AI and technology.” Karp invited her to [hear his response](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJO1TvQNido/). He said that Palestinians were dying because of Hamas. Unimpressed, she shouted back that he was getting wealthy from the killing.

Karp, unblinking, responded: “Mostly terrorists, that’s true.”

When I asked Karp about Israel’s war against Hamas, he said: “Either you master something they can’t master and you set a higher moral standard, or you meet them at the level they’re at. And I don’t want that. If you have superior technology, you don’t have to obviate our morals to beat them.”

“We have built the most civil liberties–empowering software platform ever built. And you know, we’re not obfuscating who we are or what I’m doing. And if you don’t like that, that’s totally fine. Don’t buy our product, don’t invest in us.”

Although Palantir’s work with the U.S. government is what gets all the attention, it accounts for less than half of the company’s revenue. The bulk of its business comes from commercial clients and foreign governments.

For [Tyson Foods](https://www.palantir.com/offerings/food-and-beverage/#tyson), Palantir’s software tracks everything from grain prices, a key cost in raising chickens, to the delivery of frozen nuggets to Walmart.

Palantir was also called in last year to help at Tampa General Hospital in Florida. “We heard that the Palantir technology [may or may not](https://www.palantir.com/newsroom/media/lobs3-13-2023/english/) have contributed to finding Osama bin Laden,” said Scott Arnold, the hospital’s chief digital and innovations officer. “So we thought—what if we could take something that powerful and put it into medicine?”

Tampa General’s focus: sepsis, the leading cause of death in American hospitals.

Palantir’s team, working with Tampa General doctors, built an algorithm based on 17 clinical indicators monitored around the clock by a rapid-response nurse unit. If something looks off, the system sounds an alarm, and a diagnostic team is dispatched immediately.

The whole operation cost around $3 million, Tampa General CEO John Couris said, and has saved about 600 lives so far.

When I asked Jeremy David, who co-leads Palantir’s healthcare work, why the company is so controversial despite most of its business having nothing to do with the government or war, he smiled. “It’s like: Nukes work,” he said. “They’re scary. They could be misused.”

True. But it is also true that the public hears almost nothing about Palantir’s non-defense business—while its defense business is regularly in the news. Consider Maven, Palantir’s military AI platform. Maven is used by the entire U.S. military, and international allies like [the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-strategic-partnership-to-unlock-billions-and-boost-military-ai-and-innovation) and [Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/us/politics/ukraine-new-american-technology.html), for everything from ship supply counts to targeting decisions.

Palantir is a pretext for deeper critiques of the American national security establishment, as if it is the job of a government contractor to decide which wars to fight or policies to enact.

“Maven helps fewer good guys kill more bad guys,” said Mike Gallagher, Palantir’s head of defense and a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin.

In the pre-Maven era, explained Gallagher, a [former intelligence officer](https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110934/witnesses/HHRG-116-AS26-Bio-GallagherM-20200730.pdf) in the Marine Corps, intelligence officers were more like human data analysts than strategic assets. Now, Maven ingests satellite images, battlefield signals, live tracking, and readiness reports—and displays it all on a single live map, allowing everyone from the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) to foot soldiers to make decisions as quickly as possible, using the most up-to-date data.

In Palantir’s D.C. office, I watched a notional demo. The screen showed the Russia–Ukraine border, dotted with green and red icons.

“Everything you see on this map is live data,” Patrick Dods, a Maven engineer and former Navy nuclear submarine officer, told me. “Behind every pixel are thousands of data integrations: where a ship is, how much food it has, what equipment is broken. A commander can click on a unit and instantly see its assessed combat power and readiness.”

In [Karp’s words](https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/02/02/ukraine-crisis-palantir?utm_source=chatgpt.com), Palantir is “responsible for most of the targeting in Ukraine.” Another employee described the software as integral, critical, and indispensable to fighting Putin’s Russia.

Palantir applies a similar approach when tracking down terrorists. This became clear in 2011, when Palantir provided the intelligence community with software that contributed to the identification of bin Laden’s hideout in Pakistan. “Terror suspects leave patterns they don’t really realize they’re leaving, and you can use our product to find those patterns,” Karp told me. “At least one U.S. agency reported that hundreds of terror attacks around the world have been stopped with our product.”

Some things, however, Palantir wouldn’t talk about—though you can draw your own conclusions.

Karp told me that he was “proud that the Israelis use the software” but didn’t go into much detail. (Steinberger’s book confirms that Palantir works directly with Mossad.)

When Vice President J.D. Vance [congratulated CENTCOM’s commander](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1936773495507062976), General Michael Kurilla, and others involved in the June attack on Iran’s nuclear sites—and Palantir engineers declined to comment—you didn’t need much imagination to fill in the gaps.

One criticism of Palantir that unites the left and right is that the company is conducting mass surveillance of the American public. That criticism intensified when President Trump tapped Palantir in March to “ [eliminate information silos](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/stopping-waste-fraud-and-abuse-by-eliminating-information-silos/) ” in government.

Some Americans took that to mean every government agency would input all of its data on each of us into Palantir, and track our every move.

“Palantir is not, will not, and has no interest in doing mass surveillance on U.S. citizens. And if anyone thinks we’re doing it, let me know, and I will shut it down,” Karp said.

Demonstrators blocked the entrance to Palantir’s offices in New York City in July 2025, chanting “No ICE, no Palantir!” (Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu via Getty Images)

When I asked Karp if an ICE agent would be able to find the address of an illegal immigrant through shared data with the IRS, he told me that “any platform in the world could do that. The difference between our platform and everyone else’s is you couldn’t do that and hide it. Every single action would be traceable, and not just to engineers, but to a third party.” Indeed, when Michael Cohen’s tax information was [leaked by an IRS agent](https://www.tigta.gov/error-404/index.html) in 2018, the leaker’s trail was discovered with the help of Palantir’s software.

So what *does* Palantir do with ICE?

ICE uses Palantir’s software to ensure the agency has the most accurate address for people with final removal orders, using information that ICE already has. (Palantir does not provide ICE with data.) The company also helps ICE keep track of those who are being detained or deported, and all of the logistics involved in that process. The more precise the data is, the more effective the operation is, which includes limiting collateral interactions with everyday citizens who are not meant to be ICE targets.

Another criticism of Palantir that unites both ends of the [political horseshoe](https://vanderbiltpoliticalreview.com/12168/us/horseshoe-theory-in-american-politics/) is the company’s association with Israel. While the critiques from the left are predictable, on the right, Palantir has become an indicator of *what kind* of conservative you are. That faction—anti-neoconservatives who define themselves in opposition to the failed so-called [forever wars](https://www.thefp.com/p/trumps-grand-strategy-for-the-middle) of past Republican administrations—has only grown in influence.

In that respect, Palantir is a pretext for deeper critiques of the American national security establishment, as if it is the job of a government contractor to decide which wars to fight or policies to enact.

Palantir [rejects the idea](https://x.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1974205362157883806) that its government partnerships should supersede democratically elected policy. Palantir [refused to take part](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25515531.palantir-uk-boss-rules-contract-bids-digital-id/) in the UK’s government’s digital ID program because such a policy “needs to be decided at the ballot box, not in the company boardroom,” said Louis Mosley, head of Palantir’s operations in the UK.

That way of thinking is a problem for Michael Posner, director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University and a former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Making a business decision to work with an agency like ICE that is “violating core principles of human rights and due process of law” is “devoid of ethical consideration,” Posner told me. In Posner’s telling, while Palantir doesn’t determine Trump’s immigration policy, that doesn’t mean it bears no moral responsibility for the government actions it helps effectuate.

“Assume we’re talking about Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany,” Posner added. “There is a decision to enter into a contract with the SS, and one of the things they’re using the information for is to gather the names of all the Jewish people in Poland. Is that something that the company would say: ‘We just sell technology, we sell data, and we don’t make ethical judgments about what’s an appropriate use of the technology?’ ”

Later, Posner wrote an email to me that said he “in no way” equates “the Nazi horrors of the 1930s and 1940s with what is happening in this country today.”

When I asked Karp what he thought of the comparison, he replied: “When it comes to Palantir, the self-appointed aristocracy of justice suffers from a kind of neuralgia. And one of the symptoms is abject laziness: If they think Palantir poses such a threat, why don’t they spend 20 minutes trying to understand our product?”

In *The Lord of the Rings*, the seeing stone that allows users to watch distant places eventually falls into the wrong hands.

“The Most Dangerous Corporation in America” is how Robert Reich, Bill Clinton’s labor secretary, [described Palantir](https://robertreich.substack.com/p/palantir-the-worst-of-the-corporate) in a Substack article in June. He cited [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25930212-the-scouring-of-the-shire/) from 13 former Palantir employees who accused the company of being “increasingly complicit” and “normalizing authoritarianism.” The palantir in *The Lord of the Rings* was a surveillance tool for the villains, Reich wrote.

“Tolkien’s palantir fell under the control of Sauron,” he wrote. “Thiel’s Palantir is falling under the control of Trump.”

“Palantir makes for a convenient bogeyman,” responded Jordan Hirsch, senior counselor in the CEO’s office at Palantir. “People don’t understand software in general. They’re afraid of what it can do. And people often fear things they don’t understand.”

Hirsch said joining Palantir was a leap of faith. “Like deciding to marry my wife,” he told me. “It’s an act of faith. For us, it’s a holy war.”
