### a long waited opportunity presents itself

![los-angeles-port](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d352296-d723-4029-9010-01443d6bffaa_1024x576.webp)

The origin story of the United States of America begins, in no small part, with maritime trade issues. Most of the declared and many of the undeclared, wars our nation has fought can be traced to the safety of our maritime commerce and unfettered access to the open seas.

Look at any map, and you’ll see we have oceans to the east and west of us, between our nation and its markets, allies, and competitors on the world stage.

Today we’re going to cast a wide net on that world view with returning guest, Ross Kennedy.

Ross is a logistics and trade expert who has worked at the intersection of global trade, supply chains, and national security for two decades in support of United States national interests and private-sector clients.
