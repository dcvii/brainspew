### Welcome TUSC Bretheren

Well now that I have incremented my famousity another iota on the scale, I would like to say hello to all the new folks in my extended professional family. The extension comes as a surprise to me and a number of folks, but not as a shock. The surprise is, of course, the acquisition of WhittmanHart Consulting by Rolta TUSC.

I spent the last 48 hours or so immersing myself in the people and framework of TUSC which is my new parent company. It's going to be, very possibly, the best technical fun in my career. It has been a long time since I've worked with folks who have experience at Bell Labs or in a company run by engineers, so I get the feeling that I'm going to enjoy this time immensely.

But sticking to the title at hand, I just wanted to introduce Cubegeek to TUSC folks or rather EITC folks and tell you what it's all about. It is basically that which I find open-sourceable about the cool things I actually do in my job, some theoretical ideas of things I'd like to see, some biased opinions about the industry and what think is right or wrong in it, and a healthy dose of everyday geekery. I expect that we will soon be hosting some internal blogs with secret sauce, and there is no doubt in my mind that blogs and RSS are the best way to share such info - of course there is not now a secure RSS standard, I would like to see that change.

So feel free to comment on any of the things you see here. I'm always following the few that I get here and the many that I get on my other blogs.

### Who's Your Daddy?

The word is on the wires, and my new daddy is [Rolta India](https://web.archive.org/web/20211203042148/https://finance.google.com/finance?q=BOM:500366).

> **Mumbai, July 29, 2008:** Rolta, one of India's leading IT companies, today announced the signing of an agreement to acquire WhittmanHart Consulting, the consulting Division of WhittmanHart Inc., a premier Chicago based company providing value driven solutions in digital communications, process improvement, and enabling technologies, for over 20 years. WhittmanHart Consulting (WHC) is a management and technology consulting services firm that delivers solutions with a unique blend of industry relevance, business process innovation and technology expertise. The company is recognized today as an industry leading provider of consulting services in the Business Intelligence (BI) arena, particularly focused on the Hyperion software technology acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2007. WhittmanHart, Inc. will retain and continue to operate WhittmanHart Interactive, its leading interactive agency, in a standalone capacity.

I have a lot to learn about this particular deal, but in the 90 minute conference call we had yesterday I heard all of the right things said. My outlook is cautiously optimistic. Actually I'm more like enthusiastic but cautious, because basically everything I like about WhittmanHart has just had its capital boosted.  

On the one hand, there are few things cooler than being part of a one billion dollar engineering services company, which is how I interpret Rolta. You can't get too far in oil&gas and GIS without having some serious brainage. That's all good. On the other hand, I've never heard of Rolta, have you? I get the feeling that where they're known, they are known well and do well, but elsewhere we'll have to beat down the anti-Indian body shop bias that many of us share in the industry. So we have some serious marketing to do in the US.

Suddenly, I note some very interesting points of synergy between the things I had been highlighting in my discussions with my perspective boss back a couple months ago, and the new synergies created by this asset acquisition. Still, I'm going to hold off patting myself on the back until after the Big Meeting.

So basically my take is this. Friendly takeover. Management synergy. Everything WH Consulting has been it remains, with a new big daddy, a serious, large, integrity-driven and brainy organization. It's definitely a different angle to BI, and the kind that a database guy like me is very excited about. I mean we're going to be doing BI integration with ESRI and such. That's super cool.

One more thing. There's an itch in my mind about the TUSC subsidiary that we're folding into. I swear that I've heard of them somehow, somewhere deep in my Oracle upbringing, but I just can't place them. I take them at their word that they are the premier tuners of Oracle RDBMS.  

### Once Upon a Time

I was once known to the Yahoo chat board as "olap genius". I have some predictions and stuff that are now going on 9 years old. Check out this one from the archives:

> 
> the second problem is that most projects that get this kind of attention are complicated by high rollers. the competent technical consultants are currently outgunned by the less competent management consultants. i get the impression that many data warehouse initiatives are inordinately prolonged by mission statement engineering. this is the inevitable result of not having appropriate experience to make the right decisions. another aspect of this problem is that inappropriate sums of money are directed at pikers and wasteful projects taking market share and credibility away from experts.

> hyperion will deal with the first problem (the erp data jail) by aggressively partnering with companies like acta and sagent. hyperion will always have a large direct sales force which will multiply the effect of acta and sagent product marketing. and the partnership will also leverage hyperion products into acta and sagent customer bases. as soon as it becomes a done deal - that is to say that best practices in jumpstarting analytic apps out of erp data - then the word will be out and market share takes off from there.
> 
> on the second point, hyperion has a significant advantage in that it is investing in and marketing its considerable experience in the financial area. they will have the best of both worlds, an inhouse set of mbas and cpas who can wrangle with the best of the big 5 and a set of dbas and implementation consultants who can match strengths with the outsourcers of the world. with this combination they will be well motivated to execute as a single provider. hopefully market forces will make themselves clear - it will be cheaper to do business with hyperion only as a single point solutions provider, than with outsourcers, management consultants and tech vendors.

Informatica ate Acta and Sagent's lunch and Hyperion abandoned operational OLAP.

### The Sad Truth About Microsoft

[Cringely writes](https://web.archive.org/web/20211203042148/http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20080627_005146.html) something about Microsoft that I learned the hard way last year, emphasis mine:

> This is not to say that Microsoft isn't still ambitious, but its ambitions are bounded by the company's own success. **Starting any business that is perceived as having less than $1 billion in sales ought to make no sense at all for Microsoft unless NOT starting such a business might lead to the company's failure.** That's certainly the case with MSN, for example, which is too small for Microsoft to bother with yet too important for Microsoft NOT to bother with. The only logical move for Microsoft, then, was to make the MSN business big enough to matter and the only way they could see to do that was by acquiring Yahoo, which explains this year's failed acquisition. Microsoft's failure to buy Yahoo doesn't change this scenario, either, so look for Microsoft to do something -- anything -- to grow that business, because they can't strategically afford to do the logical thing, which is to kill it.

I think it's really sad when a company like Microsoft makes promises about the kind of presence it intends to have on the industry and doesn't follow through with an ambitious and focused program supporting its partners. That was the distinct and unfortunate feeling that I got working in the PPS market for the relatively short time I was involved. I can recall that Microsoft people speculated that it was their investment in PPS that hastened the consolidation of the BI industry, but I think that was ego speaking, not strong senior management with irons in the fire.

At my current distance from happenings within Microsoft and their partners, I don't have a first hand view of whether or not such things still apply. But out here in Oracle/Hyperion land, we don't think about PPS much. Different universes? Perhaps. But Cringely still resonates.

Microsoft is a culture. It feels today very much like IBM used to in the 80s. As the big pig of the industry thinking that everybody is going to work their way. As Bill leaves, maybe it's long overdue for a huge culture change from the top by an executive team that's ready to really shake them down, split them up and force the pieces to communicate all over again, in the software world. It could be the revolution we all need.

\--

Let me add the following explicit corollary. Although I came back a little late this year to get in on the goodness of Kaleidescope and ODTUG, I am so very convinced that the level of information sharing that is bound to come out of the masters our field, like [Tow](https://web.archive.org/web/20211203042148/https://timtows-hyperion-blog.blogspot.com/), [Roske](https://web.archive.org/web/20211203042148/https://looksmarter.blogspot.com/) and [Schwartzberg](https://web.archive.org/web/20211203042148/https://glennschwartzbergs-essbase-blog.blogspot.com/), is going to propel the state of the application art beyond the capabilities of the competition.  

### DBAs Beware

I just discovered Mike Ault. I was looking for some information about Flash Drives vs Hard Disks because I want to do some performance research on Essbase total memory resident cubes, and I'm thinking..hmmm. It's a no-brainer to see that a goodly percentage of Essbase cubes can fit in under 8GB. Why not set them out to flash?

Anyway, the following is [Ault's warning:](https://web.archive.org/web/20211203042148/https://mikerault.blogspot.com/2008/05/opportunity.html)

> The indicators of course deal with the increased automation of the Oracle DBA job by Oracle coupled with the large supply of (at least on the low end) DBA services as outsource resources. It is difficult to compete with DBA resources that are happy to receive a small fraction of the salary you need to live on in the USA. I predict that the DBA job for Oracle will cease to exist as we know it within 3-5 years. Perhaps rather than being part of the large out flux of skilled but overpriced Oracle talent at this future date it is time to evaluate where you want to be in 3-5 years.

### HP + EDS = Enterprise Clouds?

A couple years ago I was ready to quit private contracting and subcontracting. I wanted to join a big deal company that really understood financial data warehousing. I had two choices, and ironically they were looking at me too. They were Beacon Analytics / Answerthink and Knightsbridge. I had worked with Knightsbridge in a sales capacity and I found them to be a very tight organization. They had people who worked with Embarcadero Technologies and they were seriously well managed - enough to walk away from crazy hungry claims of the sort that sink many services companies. I decided on Answerthink and soon after I recall that Knightsbridge was sold to HP.

The news that Knightsbridge went to HP was somewhat strange. What HP did have was a very aggressive attitude towards hosting all the hot enterprise technologies, including and especially the Hyperion suite. What they didn't have was a track record as being a company that could be counted on to deliver all that. Perhaps their purchase indicated that they were ready to change all that.

It had been my experience that most customers who had committed to HP hardware, especially those on HPUX were woefully behind in OLAP and price-performance. Expertise with Essbase and HPUX was rare indeed. After a time, IBM was the leader in Unix hosting of Hyperion apps and Essbase, whereas once upon a time, Essbase on Sun was the killer app. HP was about tied with Redhat from what I could see in the field, which meant essentially that it was an academic release.

Part of the reason was that Hyperion had pursued, for a short time, a relationship with the engineering support organization of Sun. They must have done something similar when it came to IBM after I departed. What that comprised was a deal whereby Hyperion developers could get up to date hardware, compilers and advice on how to develop for the OS kernels, memory models and various subsystems particular to the OS/hardware combinations. Who knows if such things go on today.

By the time I had been at Answerthink for an appreciable period, I came across HP again. This time going great guns about 64 bit computing. It was something and still continues to be something to get very excited about. What I've personally been able to accomplish on the HP Superdome practically defies description in the ordinary world of Hyperion apps. For a short time, we had some very interesting momentum. Such momentum is very difficult to sustain without a real paying customer, but a company like HP can afford to keep BizDev folks buzzing for a good long time, as well as keep configuration engineers setting up performance laboratories that make the case for blistering performance. The trick is maintaining the mix with a consulting organization who has a big customer attention, meaning bucks.

This is clearly what EDS provides. And I rather like the idea that HP is doing this the technical way rather than IBM's way of the brownbagging of Global Services plus the high concept dinner of PWC. The only equivalent thing left would be a Sun Micro acquisition of CSC. Then what's left? Perhaps Google acquires Tata? SAP acquires Infosys? That would be a shocker. But it gives me a clue about what could also be going on here. Like it or not corporate IT has failed. What have they failed to do? They have failed to keep Salesforce and Tata out of their business. They have failed to deal with grid computing, and they have failed to get their datacenters and moreover their global applications functioning as well as the web providers of the world have. There is a huge gap between what the largest companies like Boeing can muster in their IT and what modestly successful websites like The Washington Post online can do. The very idea of serving up enterprise data to more than 10,000 simultaneous users gives most IT organizations a severe case of cramps. If you can't do that in the online world, you're lower than toast.

So how do you ramp up internal corporate IT and enterprise data to the sub-second million-user scale of external websites? It may be apples and oranges unless and until you consider what I've seen in HP's labs, which is several hundered Essbase cubes running simultaneously. What kind of collaboration is necessary to get the corporate accounting data running in a 64bit cloud? That's the kind of thing we should begin to see if and when HP consumes EDS (or Google + Salesforce + Infosys happens). See?

It's time to take the lessons of Web 2.0 and even 1.5 and apply them to corporate IT 1.0. It's time for internal enterprise applications to run faster and be more integrated using some of the same technology that makes Google a faster way to get your company's 10Q data than searching through shared drives in your Microsoft Domain. Sound like SAP? Sound like Oracle? Yep. Only large cross functional services organizations teamed up with serious compute clouds and grids can do that. If that's what HP has in mind with EDS, it's going to be a brave new world.

### OBIEE: I Get It

Having reviewed a bit of the Oracle Open World presentations and videos, I now understand and get two things which have advanced my understanding of what may be going on here. The odd edge of the sword of being an autodidact is that you only get it when you can see the logic which parallels your own.

1\. OBIEE is prepackaged analytics. This is an idea I had a long time ago and it has haunted me for years. I don't know how many times I said that we should be doing this over at HYSL and elsewhere. But basically come up with 500 schemas in every nook and cranny of every industry and sell the bundle. That's what they do. Essentially, this can, and probably will be the BI equivalent of what began two decades ago.

I can recall when SAP first hit the states and the Germans said, you will put your business into these buckets as we have defined them. And much to my surprise businesses acquiesced rather than building their own specifications. So it may very well be with OBIEE+. Oracle will say you will manage your business performance via these KPIs as we have defined them, and companies will, rather than go through the pain of coming up with their own definitions and building them with OLAP tools.

If you can count on companies being lazy and IT as having no internal development staff, rather a cadre of application configurators, then OBIEE has every possibility of dominating the scene for the next generation. It looks brain-dead simple to implement, given that Oracle already knows the schemas for their own transaction systems ahead of time. Why not sell pre-packaged analytics?

2\. The good news is that OBIEE takes Essbase as a source. This means that integration was already strategically considered. The thing to sell is ubiquity, not so much technology. So the OBIEE vs Essbase is rather I think a moot point. Rather the point is that OBIEE Plus, should integrate System 9 front-ends as well as the (rather primitive looking) current front-ends. Selling the package can remain a priority and Oracle gets to keep up sales momentum and customer acceptance.

The question is how much diversity of front-ends is and will be necessary in the next generation. Me? I'm rather sick to death of n-tier and web services. Did it really ever give IT the upper hand for systems integration? Now that any and everybody can afford dual core 2MHz clients with 2GB of addressable RAM why the hell we are piling on the web tier? All I can say is this - look how fabulously iTunes works. Think about it for a while. **iTunes is really a middle tier right on your desktop**. Look how much data it manages, securely. Look how little IT it needs. (none).

### More OBIEE Rumors

I now have it from a third source who understands such things why OBIEE is destined to be a force to be reckoned with. They have done some serious analytics on top of supply chain, and it sells like crazy.

According to my new friend, the fate of Essbase is still up in the air but there are some considerable things to think about. First of all, a 'rationalization' of the platform means that whatever Oracle thinks it can cobble together and sell will set the strategy rather than pure technological merit. Case in point, Oracle's own application hosting offering. Apparently these very profitable packages use Noetics instead of Oracle Warehouse Builder. IE there are standards groups within Oracle that authorize technology standards (see something called 'AIM') that don't even include possibly superior inhouse technologies.

Naturally, we geeks have our own ideas about what pieces and parts work best together, but that doesn't change Oracle's or any enterprise company's salesforce's ability to assimilate a platform of technologies and make a strong case. Remember Oracle was the company that made billions promising first as Oracle and then figuring out how after the deal was done. Nobody has patience for that any longer, so a platform that can be sold and is marketed as a solution is better than the best architected solution that has no marketing and only selling. Good enough is good enough, and that is why Essbase is in the Oracle middle tier where things are swappable.

'Operational analytics' was my answer, but the fact is on a big enough hardware with a decent enough star, you can get that. What you cannot get is the pure technical goodness of multiuser concurrent read-write multidimensional access with full security out of the box. How much of BPM needs that? Some magical percentage. How much of 'operational analytics' needs that? Some magical percentage. How much of the whole BI market needs that? Some magical percentage. Question is, who is addressing that market, and will it fall to custom apps only?

My angle would be to sell an analytic platform for its own sake. The path to making Essbasable data marts in the world of 'subject-specific data warehouses' seems obvious to me. All the parts are there, DIM/INFA, MDM of any sort, Essbase and the panoply of System 9 front-ends. At the very least, I could do that bizdev (hint, hint) and extend the usefulness of an Oracle Analytic Tier for every repository based enterprise application out there. But I suspect that the NQuire people who did that for Siebel are already hip to that game - the question is which technology makes a more cost effective play. I think Essbase has the technical edge, but OBIEE has the marketing and sales edge. Again, a well-marketed solution sells better than a well-built one with no sales support. But an OEM product requires more thought, and that's where Essbase can destroy, ahem, the competition.

Speaking of which, MSFT is announcing it plans to sell a billion dollars of Sharepoint this year. A non-trivial market if I ever heard of one.

### OBIEE vs Essbase?

For the second time in a couple weeks, I have heard from some fairly reliable guys who are Oracle Partners that the wave of the future is OBIEE, which is the new name for the technology underlying Siebel Analytics. Ouch!

It is indeed possible, depending on the sentiments and skills of the Oracle sales force that this product could kill Essbase. It doesn't take a genius to recognize that if anyone can do it, Oracle engineers can reverse engineer the repositories and multidimensional models behind the Hyperion Applications. Clearly HFM is already there. But why go technically inferior to please sales guys? (That's a rhetorical question. If Oracle kills Essbase, there is NO technical competition.)

So from a technical perspective I find it very difficult to believe that substituting any other product besides Essbase under the covers is going to give any better performance, especially the 64bit stuff. The catch is that the product stream of Hyperion finapps really are not so very demanding in the main, on Essbase. The real strength of Essbase - where it has yet to be beat, is pure datamart applications.

So I could envision Essbase becoming a specialty reporting engine sold through System 9 portals and that OBIEE (whatever exactly it is) becomes the database of record within Oracle's finapps. This would throw the market into another small paroxysm but enable another class of consultants into the fray. The difficulty is that everybody is going to have to ramp up the OBIEE skills - which means another 2 years before successful implementations are going to be easy to be had.

So the really intriguing question now is who is bumping heads with Gersten - that is if Gersten is still the big dog in Oracle's BI engineering group. Might he have sold out? Is ASO functionality at a standstill? I know that there is at least one old product guy from Hyperion who was less than enthusiastic about the direction of the BI n-tier (for n>2) platform. And I know that some infrastructure guys at my old company were just about run ragged just doing the installations and certifications of Planning, HFM et al. So maybe OBIEE adds to the confusion, or maybe it simplifies things by getting Essbase out of the way.

Either way, the future of BI is getting more and more interesting every day. Lord only knows where I'm going to end up in it. On my head if I keep up this speculative provocation. But you know me. I gotta call 'em as I see 'em. Still I'm going to look for more clues in this matter. Hmm. I should re-subscribe to Stephen Swoyer's RSS.

### Two Other Reasons

I have thought of two other reasons why Microsoft would be interested in buying Yahoo - things I simply haven't yet heard in the endless speculation.

**Server Farms**  
This is pseudo insider information. When I was up in Redmond last fall, Microsoft was seriously hard up for server farms. Internal projects that had been working for months would be ready to roll out into production and suddenly people would find their projects facing no-go decisions because there are simply not enough servers to go around.

How does a company the size of Microsoft run out of server farms? It's complicated, but the short answer is that Microsoft internal security is extraordinarily demanding on end-users. Remember what Schneier said about benevolent worms? This is essentially what MS does to everyone on their intranet - they use benevolent worms to keep everybody on the inside inoculated and safe from the barbarian hordes who obviously want to hack Microsoft.

The other insider bit of info I happen to know is that Microsoft has initiated a new capex system to manage their current server farms better, and this plan is due for a major expansion. So if you were an internal client to the service that doles out servers you get a bill from this internal group. That particular internal group is expanding their capability to manage server resources by a factor of about 20.

The addition and annexation of Yahoo server properties and management would be a huge boon to Microsoft which is rather behind the 8 ball internally and acutely aware of a need to expand. There's a new high tech colocation facility in Seattle, I forget the name of it, but people talk about it in hushed tones - and they are booked to capacity out a year. Nobody has the state of the art server farms that Microsoft needs right now, and I'm sure that is a strategic necessity for them.  
**  
Hotmail + Yahoo Mail = Giant Captive Audience.**  
Sometimes it's just that simple. Microsoft wants the eyeballs. Forget search, just think assets and alliances but focus it on the Yahoo customer. I would probably never think of Microsoft if I wanted to get DSL, but I'd think of Yahoo.

Yahoo's customers - the people who use my.yahoo.com and maybe host their homepage at Yahoo, have been around for a long time, and from what I infer from my own high tech crowd, are not the same class of users who would do that MSN butterfly browser thing. In other words, they are a more upscale demographic in terms of their likelihood to purchase additional services, whereas your MSN and AOL guys are just passive eyeballs.
