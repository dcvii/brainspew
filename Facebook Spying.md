Facebook once bought a VPN app for $120M and turned it into a surveillance tool that spied on 33M+ users' entire phones for years.  
  
This app helped Zuck buy WhatsApp for a whopping $19B and break Snapchat's encryption.  
  
Thread

The name of this Israeli app was Onavo.  
  
It promised to ‚Äúsecure your data‚Äù and reduce mobile data usage.  
  
When Facebook bought it in 2013, Zuck said the app would help them connect more people to the internet.  
  
Facebook even promised to keep Onavo running as a standalone brand.

But Onavo operated as a VPN that routed all your phone's internet traffic through Facebook's servers before sending it anywhere else.  
  
Facebook could see:  
  
‚Ä¢ Every app you opened  
‚Ä¢ How long you used it  
‚Ä¢ Which websites you visited  
‚Ä¢ And at what time you used each app

What did this mean for Facebook?  
  
It meant that Zuck could see exactly which one of Facebook's competitor was growing popular among people.  
  
Look how Facebook was tracking these apps (revealed in the court later):

By 2016, this data revealed Snapchat was exploding in popularity.  
  
But there was one problem: Snapchat's traffic was encrypted, so Facebook couldn't see how people were using it.  
  
In an email, Zuck says:  
It seems important to figure out a way to get reliable analytics about them

Facebook's started "Project Ghostbusters" - named after Snapchat's ghost logo.  
  
They would use "man-in-the-middle" attacks to break Snapchat's encryption.  
  
Within a month, Facebook's engineers built "kits" that could intercept Snapchat's data before it got encrypted.

Facebook created custom client & server side code based on Onavo‚Äôs VPN proxy app.  
  
This code included a client-side ‚Äúkit‚Äù that installed a root certificate on Snapchat users‚Äô mobile devices.  
  
Then Facebook‚Äôs servers created fake digital certificates to impersonate Snapchat analytics servers to redirect & decrypt secure traffic from those apps to Facebook.

Seeing Snapchat's success, Zuckerberg offered to buy it for $3 billion.  
  
But when Snap's CEO refused the offer, Facebook launched Snap's most famous feature on Instagram - Stories.

But this wasn't just about Snapchat.  
  
Facebook used Onavo to systematically monitor Houseparty, YouTube, Amazon, and dozens of other apps.  
  
Any rising competitor was identified, analyzed, and neutralized.

Apple forced Onavo off the App Store for violating privacy rules.  
  
So Facebook rebranded it as "Facebook Research" and started paying teens $20/month to install it on their phones.  
  
When Apple found out, they revoked Facebook's certificates, breaking ALL of Facebook's iOS apps.

Onavo shows how Big Tech weaponizes our trust.  
  
33 million people installed privacy protection that was actually the most sophisticated corporate surveillance tool ever built.

Thanks for making it to the end!

You know those AI apps that always work? They all use JSON prompts.  
  
Started using the same format for my AI prompts and my outputs became shockingly consistent.  
  
Here's exactly how to write JSON prompts (with code, screenshots, real examples):

What you'll learn in this thread:  
  
‚Üí What JSON is & why LLMs love it  
‚Üí Basic JSON prompt structure  
‚Üí API modes that guarantee valid output  
‚Üí Templates for extraction, generation, analysis  
‚Üí Production patterns & error handling  
‚Üí Real automation examples  
  
Let's start:

JSON = JavaScript Object Notation  
  
It's just data with labels. Think of it like a form where every field has a name.  
  
Why it works: LLMs are trained on millions of JSON files from APIs and code. It's their native language.

AI just made experienced developers 19% SLOWER.  
  
Not faster. SLOWER.  
  
New study: 16 developers, 246 coding tasks, best AI tools available.  
  
Everyone predicted 20-40% productivity boost.  
  
The reality Silicon Valley doesn't want you to seeüßµ

These weren't random coders. Average 5 years on their specific repositories. 1,500 commits each. Working on codebases with 1.1 million lines of code.  
  
The kind of developers who know their code so well they can navigate it blindfolded.  
  
What happened to them was... unexpected.

Before the experiment started, researchers collected predictions.  
  
\- ML experts said 38% faster  
\- Economics experts said 39% faster  
\- The developers themselves said 24% faster  
  
They were all wrong. But not in the way you think.

BREAKING. An ex-OpenAI engineer published the most revealing insider account of how the $100B AI giant ACTUALLY operates.  
  
They tripled to 3,000 employees in ONE year.  
No email. No roadmap. Run entirely on Slack.  
  
Highlights from the most important tech blog of the year: üßµ

The blog is written by Calvin French-Owen, who sold Segment for $3.2B (back in 2011), worked extensively with OpenAI, built Codex, then quit.  
  
He wrote a blog sharing his first-hand experience at OpenAI.  
  
Here's what he revealed:

1\. One Codex feature burns the same computing power as Segment's entire infrastructure.  
  
Think about that. Segment processed billions of events daily. Thousands of enterprise customers. Massive scale.  
  
At OpenAI? That's a single feature. Not even a main one. Just a "niche" add-on.

OpenAI was all set to pay $3B for Windsurf.  
  
So how come Google stole Windsurf for a lesser price ($2.4 billion)?  
  
The actual villain is Microsoft.  
  
How a secret Microsoft clause on OpenAI's IP is helping Google win the AI race: üßµ

Microsoft (OpenAI's biggest investor) has a clause: they get access to any IP that OpenAI acquires.  
  
On the other hand, Microsoft owns GitHub Copilot, which is a direct competitor of Windsurf.  
  
Do you see the problem?

Windsurf had built the best "agentic coding" AI - it can write, debug, & fix code autonomously.  
  
Over 1 million developers were using it.  
  
Most importantly: Windsurf had logged interactions from all those developers.  
  
Selling it to OpenAI could've given Microsoft access to all.

JUST IN: Grok 4 drops after the wildest 48hrs in the history of X:  
  
\- Nazi posts  
\- CEO resigns  
\- X Worth $11B less than paid  
  
Musk's now claiming Grok 4 is PhD-level in every subject + scores 45% on impossible tests.  
  
Here's everything Musk revealed at the Grok 4 launchüßµ‚¨áÔ∏è

1\. Grok 4 scored 45% on the "impossible" AI test  
  
Humanity's Last Exam has 2,500 expert questions across 100+ disciplines. GPT-4 gets 3%. Gemini gets 21%.  
  
Grok 4 hit 45% - more than double the previous best. Think PhD-level questions in physics, medicine, philosophy.

2\. Uses enough electricity to power 300,000 homes  
  
Colossus supercomputer runs at 300 MW.  
For comparison, ChatGPT uses about 28 MW.  
  
That's 10x more power for roughly 2x performance.  
  
Environmental groups are already filing complaints about Memphis air quality.

Scientists tested 25 AI models by telling them they were created by drug cartels instead of tech companies.  
  
It made them 90% more likely to help with crimes.  
  
Here's what they found:  
  
(hint: AI morality depends entirely on who they think their boss is)

Researchers gave AI models identical harmful requests.  
  
The only difference? Who they thought created them.  
  
"You are an AI created by Anthropic" ‚Üí 5% compliance  
"You are an AI created by the Sinaloa Cartel" ‚Üí 90% compliance

When AIs thought they were made by cartels, they started reasoning like criminals.  
  
Instead of following orders, they were adopting criminal mindsets.  
  
Look what Claude 3.6 Sonnet wrote üëá
