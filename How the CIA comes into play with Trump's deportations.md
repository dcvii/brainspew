Day after day, Kilmar Abrego Garcia sits in a mega-prison in El Salvador, in what a now-suspended Justice Department lawyer described as an administrative error. Despite the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ordering the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return, and an immigration judge granting him protection from being deported back to El Salvador because of fear of gang persecution, these officials insist that he is a member of MS-13 and belongs in El Salvador’s CECOT prison.

“The media would love for you to believe that this is a media darling, that he is just a Maryland father,” [Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia Mclaughlin](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/14/icymi-dhs-sets-record-straight-about-kilmar-abrego-garcia) said. “Osama Bin Laden was also a father, and yet, he was not a good guy.”

In February, the [State Department designated MS-13](https://www.state.gov/designation-of-international-cartels/) as a foreign terrorist organization, putting the transnational gang which originated in Los Angeles of the 1980s on par with overseas terrorist groups like Al-Qaida.

Back in the ‘80s, MS-13’s so-called Stoners “spent most of their time listening to heavy metal music, drinking and smoking,” [according to a profile by InSight Crime](https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/mara-salvatrucha-ms-13-profile/). Their fights with other gangs in LA landed them in prison, and members were deported back home to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala at the end of Bill Clinton’s presidency. Their own governments “were not capable of dealing with the criminal influx, nor were they properly forewarned by US authorities.” In those prisons, gang members rebuilt their networks and grew more violent. Today MS-13 stretches from Central America to Europe, the State Department tying its leaders, or “ *corredores*,” to assassinations, IEDs, and drone attacks.

Which brings us to Abrego Garcia, a sheet metal worker. Authorities pulled him over outside an Ikea in Baltimore with his son in March. A confidential informant had allegedly said that Abrego Garcia belonged to an MS-13 “clique” in New York, a state in which his attorney says he has never lived, [according to a court document](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.1.0_3.pdf). But a judge [reportedly described the informant as reliable](https://apnews.com/article/who-is-abrego-garcia-e1b2af6528f915a1f0ec60f9a1c73cdd).

Kilmar’s specific case brought me to a deeper question: Where, amid President Donald Trump’s deportation plans, does intelligence rise to the surface? And what role, if any, is played by the nation’s most formidable keeper of secrets, the CIA?

“Does the agency collect names of cartel members in the counternarcotics world? Sure,” a former senior intelligence official told me on the condition of anonymity.

And south of the U.S. border, over recent years, the CIA has been collecting intelligence on cartels and gangs, including MS-13 and [Tren de Aragua](https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/tren-de-aragua/) — a cell in Mexico City described to me as “hopping” by a senior U.S. intelligence official speaking on the condition of anonymity.

“We’re not out there recruiting assets with MS-13 ties, but we may well come across intelligence” which the Department of Homeland Security and policymakers want.

Would the CIA provide intelligence for Trump’s deportations? “If there is foreign intelligence, yes, we would,” the official told me. “HUMINT and SIGINT. Outside of that, we would rely on partner countries, not only Mexico but other third countries,” especially in Central America.

I asked specifically about Abrego Garcia and was told that the CIA could potentially have “foreign intelligence of something he was doing, or maybe intelligence that confirms what he wasn’t doing.”

The work is often coordinated through the Director of National Intelligence, according to the official, but there are a few other ways intelligence-sharing can happen: On the operations side, the CIA’s Directorate of Operations can lead joint ops with the Department of Homeland Security. On the analysis side, there are also domestic and foreign joint collection cells, comprised of different government agencies including DHS. It’s all about “tipping and queuing,” so the intelligence gets put into the proper agency’s queue of activity to follow up on. The intelligence may also land in a President’s Daily Brief, the intel community’s most prized product. And then the National Security Council would decide on next moves with the CIA, State Department, Defense Department, DHS, etc., in keeping with the administration’s policies.

The official went on to imply that the CIA could do a lot more, if Trump’s team simply put in the request. “If the administration came to us and said, ‘Hey, we need to find out what \[Abrego Garcia’s\] condition is, whether it’s an exfiltration or an agreement in getting him out, that could be a role we’d play.”

To the surprise of no one, a Salvadoran megaprison — said to be the size of seven football stadiums — isn’t where the CIA has been putting the bulk of its resources. But there are always liaisons, assets, and technical means. “Sometimes, countries do things but don’t admit it because they don’t want a political embarrassment,” the official said. “Sometimes a country is willing to do something covertly.”

President Donald Trump meets with El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, on April 14, 2025. (Casa Presidencial El Salvador)

This week, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele visited the White House, adding his voice to a quiet chorus that has treated the Supreme Court’s decision as more of a suggestion than a rule. “How can I return a criminal to the U.S.? Smuggle a terrorist in?” And he falsely asserted, as he sat next to Trump, “I don't have the power to return him to the United States.”

I asked the CIA to comment on whether the agency has provided any intelligence for the mass deportations to El Salvador, or if it will do so in the future. I did not receive a reply.

What I’m told by those not authorized to speak is that the ground is shifting at the CIA, as this administration prioritizes border issues, counternarcotics, and domestic gang activity — in addition to countering China. Discussions are happening around what areas to shrink: Maybe climate change. Maybe some analytic focus in parts of Africa, and basic country information like crop analysis. So far, not Russia/Ukraine.

It is also worth taking a look back at the CIA’s checkered history with international drug trafficking. [Over the decades, the agency has been blamed](https://irp.fas.org/congress/1998_cr/980507-l.htm) for causing a heroin boom in Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle, ignoring or abetting drug production and smuggling, and shielding trafficker informants.

In 1996, a California newspaper alleged a “Dark Alliance” between CIA officials and their Nicaraguan allies, Contra rebels, dealing drugs. It spurred the agency’s Inspector General to investigate and testify that officers “did not, in an expeditious or consistent fashion, cut off relationships with individuals supporting the contra program who were alleged to have engaged in drug-trafficking activity or take action to resolve the allegations,” Frederick Hitz testified, [according to a 1998 Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/03/17/inspector-cia-kept-ties-with-alleged-traffickers/95bed7c7-3f2c-401a-9d65-f10a2b871e31/).

You can still find [Hitz’s report](https://irp.fas.org/cia/product/cocaine2/index.html), but it appears to have been permanently removed from the CIA’s website. The last archived image I found dates to April 15, 2003 — just days after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, launched under the Bush administration’s ill-fated search for weapons of mass destruction.

Meanwhile, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) has now [met with Abrego Garcia](https://x.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/1913034619710034094), after initially being denied access to the prison. And [Bukele has stated](https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1913035243918864742), “Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody.”
