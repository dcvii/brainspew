Tech industry has always been somewhat vulnerable to success theater. I worked through the service oriented architecture mania where our company turned FTP batch scripts into services running on IBM's BPEL monster that was about .001% as efficient as the original FTP script.

This was done only so the company had marketing material to claim "success" with these expensive tools.

Now we have the AI mania, but it is the biggest mania of them all. Nothing compares. The collapse is going to be equally devastating.
