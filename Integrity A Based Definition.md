I am going to write a book expanding on the article “[Based Definitions: A Philosophical Practice](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/based-definitions-a-philosophical).” It was one of my favorite entries, and I believe more people would benefit from engaging with it.

A summary:

***Own your words, own your philosophy**. You can think beyond [lexical definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_definition) (the "official" ones found in a dictionary) or [stipulative definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipulative_definition) (those imposed by ego, expecting others to adopt them). Instead, I recommend “based definitions”—definitions that come from Source, deeply resonate with an individual, and require no external validation.*

A key yet massively overlooked aspect of practical philosophy is owning the words you use. It’s something I practice in both my [philosophical counseling sessions](https://calendly.com/peterlimberg/xknot?month=2024-01) and my own self-inquiries. Defining words for yourself is a powerful move—it grounds your mind on a firm foundation and strengthens your intellectual authority.

*"Clear thinkers appeal to their own authority." — Naval Ravikant*

Today, I was reflecting on the word integrity and arrived at this based definition:

**Integrity is aligning action, speech, and thought with what is [good, true, and beautiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentals).**

- Integrity is doing what you say you’ll do.
- Integrity is saying what you think is true.
- Integrity is thinking what is beautiful.[1](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/integrity-a-based-definition?publication_id=34046&post_id=159076785&isFreemail=true&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true#footnote-1-159076785)

Success, wealth, status, and power all have their place and may naturally unfold from living wisely. But pursuing them directly—whether consciously or unconsciously—without a strong foundation in integrity? Forget about it. It has soul costs, leads to corruption, and will corrupt others.

Don’t play those games. Base yourself in integrity, and start with the words you use.

Guess what?! The Stoa’s birthday (March 21st) is next Friday from 8 AM to 10 AM Eastern. In celebration, [Collective Journaling](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/people-of-the-journal) will be returning for ONE DAY. We will be engaging in a Based Definition exercise.

Event description:

> Join us for a special edition of Collective Journaling on The Stoa’s Birthday, where we will engage in Based Definition exercises—exploring words not just as signifiers, but as living realities drawn from Source. Together, we’ll reflect, redefine, and attune to meanings that deeply resonate, anchoring our philosophy in integrity. Come with an open mind, a word that calls to you, and a willingness to shape language as a practice of truth.

This event will be followed by a Lent-friendly session on overcoming The Pull for good at 12 PM Eastern on March 22nd, which happens to fall on the spring equinox. ✨

If you’d like to own your words and start spring by “popping” out of The Pull, you can RSVP for both events behind the paywall.
