In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **Bott periodicity theorem** describes a periodicity in the [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group "Homotopy group") of [classical groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_group "Classical group"), discovered by [Raoul Bott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Bott "Raoul Bott")  ([1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFBott1957), [1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFBott1959)), which proved to be of foundational significance for much further research, in particular in [K-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-theory "K-theory") of stable complex [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle"), as well as the [stable homotopy groups of spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_homotopy_groups_of_spheres "Stable homotopy groups of spheres"). Bott periodicity can be formulated in numerous ways, with the periodicity in question always appearing as a period-2 phenomenon, with respect to dimension, for the theory associated to the [unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_group "Unitary group"). See for example [topological K-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_K-theory "Topological K-theory").

There are corresponding period-8 phenomena for the matching theories, ([real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")) [KO-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KO-theory "KO-theory") and ([quaternionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion")) [KSp-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=KSp-theory&action=edit&redlink=1 "KSp-theory (page does not exist)"), associated to the real [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group") and the quaternionic [symplectic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_group "Symplectic group"), respectively. The [J-homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-homomorphism "J-homomorphism") is a homomorphism from the homotopy groups of orthogonal groups to [stable homotopy groups of spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_homotopy_groups_of_spheres "Stable homotopy groups of spheres"), which causes the period 8 Bott periodicity to be visible in the stable homotopy groups of spheres.

Bott showed that if ${\displaystyle U(\infty )}$ is defined as the [direct limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_limit_of_groups "Direct limit of groups") of the [unitary groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_group "Unitary group") ${\displaystyle U(n)}$ , then its [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_groups "Homotopy groups") are periodic with period 2:[^2]

${\displaystyle \pi _{i}(U(\infty ))\simeq \pi _{i+2}(U(\infty ))}$

for ${\displaystyle i\geq 0}$ , and its first two homotopy groups are as follows:

${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\pi _{0}(U(\infty ))&\simeq 0\\\pi _{1}(U(\infty ))&\simeq \mathbb {Z} .\end{aligned}}}$

The "real" or "orthogonal" version of the Bott periodicity theorem, about the direct limit of the [orthogonal groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_groups "Orthogonal groups") ${\displaystyle O(n)}$ , says that

${\displaystyle \pi _{i}(O(\infty ))\simeq \pi _{i+8}(O(\infty ))}$

for ${\displaystyle i\geq 0}$ , and its first 8 homotopy groups are as follows:

${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\pi _{0}(O(\infty ))&\simeq \mathbb {Z} _{2}\\\pi _{1}(O(\infty ))&\simeq \mathbb {Z} _{2}\\\pi _{2}(O(\infty ))&\simeq 0\\\pi _{3}(O(\infty ))&\simeq \mathbb {Z} \\\pi _{4}(O(\infty ))&\simeq 0\\\pi _{5}(O(\infty ))&\simeq 0\\\pi _{6}(O(\infty ))&\simeq 0\\\pi _{7}(O(\infty ))&\simeq \mathbb {Z} \end{aligned}}}$

The context of Bott periodicity is that the [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group "Homotopy group") of [spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), which would be expected to play the basic part in [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology") by analogy with [homology theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_theory "Homology theory"), have proved elusive (and the theory is complicated). The subject of [stable homotopy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_homotopy_theory "Stable homotopy theory") was conceived as a simplification, by introducing the [suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_\(mathematics\) "Suspension (mathematics)") ([smash product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash_product "Smash product") with a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle")) operation, and seeing what (roughly speaking) remained of homotopy theory once one was allowed to suspend both sides of an equation as many times as one wished. The [stable theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_theory "Stable theory") was still hard to compute with, in practice.

What Bott periodicity offered was an insight into some highly non-trivial spaces, with central status in topology because of the connection of their [cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology "Cohomology") with [characteristic classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_class "Characteristic class"), for which all the (*unstable*) homotopy groups could be calculated. These spaces are the (infinite, or *stable*) unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups *U*, *O* and Sp. In this context, *stable* refers to taking the union *U* (also known as the [direct limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_limit "Direct limit")) of the sequence of inclusions

${\displaystyle U(1)\subset U(2)\subset \cdots \subset U=\bigcup _{k=1}^{\infty }U(k)}$

and similarly for *O* and Sp. Note that Bott's use of the word *stable* in the title of his seminal paper refers to these stable [classical groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_groups "Classical groups") and not to [stable homotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_homotopy_theory "Stable homotopy theory") groups.

The important connection of Bott periodicity with the [stable homotopy groups of spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_homotopy_groups_of_spheres "Stable homotopy groups of spheres") ${\displaystyle \pi _{n}^{S}}$ comes via the so-called stable [*J* -homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-homomorphism "J-homomorphism") from the (unstable) homotopy groups of the (stable) classical groups to these stable homotopy groups ${\displaystyle \pi _{n}^{S}}$ . Originally described by [George W. Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Whitehead "George W. Whitehead"), it became the subject of the famous [Adams conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_conjecture "Adams conjecture") (1963) which was finally resolved in the affirmative by [Daniel Quillen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Quillen "Daniel Quillen") (1971).

Bott's original results may be succinctly summarized in:

**Corollary:** The (unstable) homotopy groups of the (infinite) [classical groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_groups "Classical groups") are periodic:

${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\pi _{k}(U)&=\pi _{k+2}(U)\\\pi _{k}(O)&=\pi _{k+4}(\operatorname {Sp} )\\\pi _{k}(\operatorname {Sp} )&=\pi _{k+4}(O)&&k=0,1,\ldots \end{aligned}}}$

**Note:** The second and third of these isomorphisms intertwine to give the 8-fold periodicity results:

${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\pi _{k}(O)&=\pi _{k+8}(O)\\\pi _{k}(\operatorname {Sp} )&=\pi _{k+8}(\operatorname {Sp} ),&&k=0,1,\ldots \end{aligned}}}$

For the theory associated to the infinite [unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_group "Unitary group"), *U*, the space *BU* is the [classifying space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifying_space "Classifying space") for stable complex [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle") (a [Grassmannian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian "Grassmannian") in infinite dimensions). One formulation of Bott periodicity describes the twofold loop space, ${\displaystyle \Omega ^{2}BU}$ of *BU*. Here, ${\displaystyle \Omega }$ is the [loop space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_space "Loop space") [functor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor "Functor"), [right adjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_adjoint "Right adjoint") to [suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_\(topology\) "Suspension (topology)") and [left adjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_adjoint "Left adjoint") to the [classifying space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifying_space "Classifying space") construction. Bott periodicity states that this double loop space is essentially *BU* again; more precisely,
$$
{\displaystyle \Omega ^{2}BU\simeq \mathbb {Z} \times BU}
$$
 is essentially (that is, [homotopy equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_equivalence "Homotopy equivalence") to) the union of a countable number of copies of *BU*. An equivalent formulation is 
$$
{\displaystyle \Omega ^{2}U\simeq U.}
$$

Either of these has the immediate effect of showing why (complex) topological *K* -theory is a 2-fold periodic theory.

In the corresponding theory for the infinite [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group"), *O*, the space *BO* is the [classifying space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifying_space "Classifying space") for stable real [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle"). In this case, Bott periodicity states that, for the 8-fold loop space,
$$
{\displaystyle \Omega ^{8}BO\simeq \mathbb {Z} \times BO}
$$
 or equivalently,
$$
{\displaystyle \Omega ^{8}O\simeq O,}
$$

which yields the consequence that *KO* -theory is an 8-fold periodic theory. Also, for the infinite [symplectic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_group "Symplectic group"), Sp, the space BSp is the [classifying space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifying_space "Classifying space") for stable quaternionic [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle"), and Bott periodicity states that 
$$
{\displaystyle \Omega ^{8}\operatorname {BSp} \simeq \mathbb {Z} \times \operatorname {BSp} ;}
$$
 or equivalently 
$$
{\displaystyle \Omega ^{8}\operatorname {Sp} \simeq \operatorname {Sp} .}
$$

Thus both topological real *K* -theory (also known as *KO* -theory) and topological quaternionic *K* -theory (also known as KSp-theory) are 8-fold periodic theories.

One elegant formulation of Bott periodicity makes use of the observation that there are natural embeddings (as closed subgroups) between the classical groups. The loop spaces in Bott periodicity are then homotopy equivalent to the [symmetric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_space "Symmetric space") of successive quotients, with additional discrete factors of **Z**.

Over the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"):

${\displaystyle U\times U\subset U\subset U\times U.}$

Over the real numbers and quaternions:

${\displaystyle O\times O\subset O\subset U\subset \operatorname {Sp} \subset \operatorname {Sp} \times \operatorname {Sp} \subset \operatorname {Sp} \subset U\subset O\subset O\times O.}$

These sequences corresponds to sequences in [Clifford algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra") – see [classification of Clifford algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_Clifford_algebras "Classification of Clifford algebras"); over the complex numbers:

${\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \oplus \mathbb {C} \subset \mathbb {C} \subset \mathbb {C} \oplus \mathbb {C} .}$

Over the real numbers and quaternions:

${\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \oplus \mathbb {R} \subset \mathbb {R} \subset \mathbb {C} \subset \mathbb {H} \subset \mathbb {H} \oplus \mathbb {H} \subset \mathbb {H} \subset \mathbb {C} \subset \mathbb {R} \subset \mathbb {R} \oplus \mathbb {R} ,}$

where the [division algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algebra "Division algebra") indicate "matrices over that algebra".

Animation of the Bott periodicity clock using a Mod 8 clock face with second hand mnemonics taken from the I-Ching with the real Clifford algebra of signature (p,q) denoted as Cl p,q ( {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } )=Cl(p,q).

As they are 2-periodic/8-periodic, they can be arranged in a circle, where they are called the **Bott periodicity clock** and **Clifford algebra clock**.

The Bott periodicity results then refine to a sequence of [homotopy equivalences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_equivalence "Homotopy equivalence"):

For complex *K* -theory:

${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Omega U&\simeq \mathbb {Z} \times BU=\mathbb {Z} \times U/(U\times U)\\\Omega (\mathbb {Z} \times BU)&\simeq U=(U\times U)/U\end{aligned}}}$

For real and quaternionic *KO* - and KSp-theories:

${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Omega (\mathbb {Z} \times BO)&\simeq O=(O\times O)/O&\Omega (\mathbb {Z} \times \operatorname {BSp} )&\simeq \operatorname {Sp} =(\operatorname {Sp} \times \operatorname {Sp} )/\operatorname {Sp} \\\Omega O&\simeq O/U&\Omega \operatorname {Sp} &\simeq \operatorname {Sp} /U\\\Omega (O/U)&\simeq U/\operatorname {Sp} &\Omega (\operatorname {Sp} /U)&\simeq U/O\\\Omega (U/\operatorname {Sp} )&\simeq \mathbb {Z} \times \operatorname {BSp} =\mathbb {Z} \times \operatorname {Sp} /(\operatorname {Sp} \times \operatorname {Sp} )&\Omega (U/O)&\simeq \mathbb {Z} \times BO=\mathbb {Z} \times O/(O\times O)\end{aligned}}}$

The resulting spaces are homotopy equivalent to the classical reductive [symmetric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_space "Symmetric space"), and are the successive quotients of the terms of the Bott periodicity clock. These equivalences immediately yield the Bott periodicity theorems.

## Proofs

Bott's original proof ([Bott 1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFBott1959)) used [Morse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_theory "Morse theory"), which [Bott (1956)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFBott1956) had used earlier to study the homology of [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group"). Many different proofs have been given.
