**STANDING TRACKSIDE** at the Nürburgring feels like living in an infinite windup toy, one that dates back 100 years. Suffused with a musk of fuel and burned rubber, cacophonous with the howls of unwinding engines, the 12.9-mile circuit in western Germany is a testament to our obsession with speed. The cars that screech and bang around the tortuous track have changed, but the goal is the same as ever: shaving time.

“Ten years ago, one might have thought we were already approaching the limit of what is physically possible. Today we know that is not the case,” says Andreas Preuninger, head of GT cars for Porsche. “The first [993] GT2 was one of the first Porsche road cars to lap the Nürburgring in less than eight minutes [7:56.57]. Now, the current 911 GT2 RS is over a minute faster [6:47.25].”

Time isn’t being conserved here for some other application. It can’t be bestowed upon a grander pursuit. It’s lost time. Intentionally lost.

In the past several decades, research-and-development facilities from various automakers and suppliers have sprung up around the Nürburgring’s periphery, each intently focused on this singular pursuit. Considered objectively, as the cars roar by, it seems quite an absurd thing on which to expend so much effort.

Don’t get us wrong. _Road & Track_ has, since its inception in 1947, been the magazine that championed speed and proselytized its glories to the American populace— something it still does today with the annual [Performance Car of the Year](https://www.roadandtrack.com/pcoty-2019/) feature. Yet in this inflection point for the automobile, this era of near 300-hp minivans and 700-hp SUVs and Ludicrous-mode electric sedans with autonomous capability, we must ask: Are we reaching the limits of performance or, more precisely, the limits of what’s enjoyable and relevant to drivers? What do we keep chasing?

For years, the cars we love were built from a predictable recipe: naturally aspirated gas engine driving the rear wheels through a manually shifted transmission, a selfish little cabin to minimize weight and encumbrances, and just enough trunk space to suggest a modicum of practicality. These cars looked like a Stutz Bearcat or an Austin Healey 3000 or a Mazda Miata or a Dodge Viper.

Those old recipes have been flamed. In the digital age, massive power comes courtesy of computer-controlled fuel/air alchemy fortified by forced induction or a tessellation of batteries. Face-mashing acceleration arrives via algorithmic all-wheel-drive systems that make the most of an engine’s horsepower. Active aerodynamic and suspension manipulators and ever-more-exotic tire compounds keep individual wheels planted, rendering mass almost irrelevant.

Manufacturers, and customers with unlimited budgets, are battling the limits of adhesion in a quest for sub-two-second 0-to-60 runs, 300-mph top speeds, and six-minute Ring laps. And they’ll probably succeed. Meanwhile, a 5200-pound Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk accelerates from 0 to 60 mph quicker than a new Mustang GT, and a Honda Odyssey minivan hits that mark in about the same time as a late-Eighties Ferrari Mondial.

Higher performance at every price point and category is something for car lovers to celebrate. And it’s worth noting that modern performance is, with the exception of outliers like the quarter-mile-focused Dodge Demon, multidimensional.

“Performance is something you cannot measure, like in the past, only in terms of how many horsepower, what is the maximum speed, or what is the 0–100,” says Maurizio Reggiani, Lamborghini’s chief technical officer. That is the reason the Ring—where the company’s Aventador SVJ recently set the production-car lap record—has become such a popular gauge of performance, he notes. “I can tell you that if a car is able to do the record at the Nürburgring, it is not due to the power but the mix of everything.”

Yet the side effect of all this potency and wizardry is that the performance vehicle has been decoupled from tradition, common sense, and, increasingly, the driver.

“Twenty years ago, you could meet the expectations of both enthusiasts and track guys with the same car,” Preuninger says, “because taking out weight was the old-school, classic way of making a car faster and mostly meant making the car more pure as well. Today we have systems such as PDK or rear-axle steering that overcompensate for their weight penalty by far with better performance, so modern go-fast cars have a very different spec sheet than a more analog, pure driver’s car."

The oft-cited evidence of the performance car’s departure from driver involvement is the decline of the manual transmission. The simple reasoning is that computers can shift faster and more smoothly than humans. The reality is more complicated—and disquieting.

“All the systems that are integrated in the car need to have a dialog with one another,” Reggiani explains. “The clutch is one of the fuses of the system, whether you’re engaging or disengaging the torque. [A manual] creates a hole in the communication. . . . If you want to control the chassis, you must control the power.” In other words, the biggest limitation to modern performance cars is neither technology nor even physics. It’s the driver.

“If you want to control the power, the clutch must be under the control of the brain of the car, not your brain,” Reggiani says.

A more practical concern is that if automakers can inject performance into any kind of vehicle, few consumers would consider a traditional sports car. If you can have it all, why give it up for something small, impractical, and hard-riding? According to a recent large-scale study from automotive-research firm Strategic Vision, new-car buyers’ top concern is finding a vehicle with a proper balance of comfort, features, and performance. The result is a proliferation of performance crossovers at every price point, from the Ford Edge ST to the Mercedes-AMG GLA45 to the Lamborghini Urus SUV, which Reggiani points out is quicker than the first Lamborghini Gallardo. He again credits the increasingly sophisticated automation of the vehicle.

Some aren’t on board with that future. That includes Albert Biermann.

Formerly vice president of engineering for BMW’s famed M cars, Biermann was responsible for some of the industry’s most iconic sport sedans. But he decamped a few years ago to become head of high-performance vehicle development for Korean brands Hyundai and Kia, where he is tasked with democratizing performance and dispersing magic into affordable Velosters and Optimas.

“Everybody can have speed and power now,” he says. “We are going for fun-to-drive, and not only for very experienced drivers. Our cars should be approachable by normal drivers. They should be able, with their driving skills, to discover the fun-to-drive element.”

Biermann isn’t alone. Faced with the possibility that performance no longer equals enjoyment, the obvious if controversial answer is to redefine performance altogether.

“We are not focusing on horsepower,” says Masashi Otsuka, Mazda North America’s vice president of research and development and design. Mazda—which once played ball with RX-7s and Mazdaspeed 3s—is bowing out of the performance arms race, not because it no longer cares about enthusiasts, but precisely because it does. “This kind of acceleration is sometimes fun. But in normal daily driving, it’s not so fun. We are concentrating more on control and direct feeling.”

There is precedent for a pendulum swing away from computerized performance and toward a more analog experience. “Have a close look at the watch industry,” says Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG. “The old-style chronograph is the most profitable product that the watch industry has. This is kind of a counterpart to everything we call digital. So maybe we’re going to have cars which are purely combustion-driven, especially in the performance segment, without any driver assistance.”

Mass production yielded the arts-and-crafts movement in the late 19th century. As our 21st-century world becomes increasingly virtual, discerning consumers have retreated to analog tourbillons.

This notion has been a boon to Lance Stander, a major U.S. distributor of the Caterham, a retro-modern Lotus Seven designed in the 1950s. This 60-year-old sports-car design and others like it—including Morgan-esque three-wheelers from Polaris and Vanderhall or lightweight tracksters like the Ariel Atom—have never been more popular, even among youth. “Most of our buyers, I would say, are 50-plus,” Stander says. “But we’re getting a big move toward the younger generation, who might have seen these cars only in video games.”

Stander attributes this elemental attraction to the lack of engagement in contemporary vehicles. “The modern cars have gotten so perfect,” he says, “there’s no excitement to driving one of them.”

Some chief purveyors of speed admit that the time may come to pull back from peak performance. But most are unready to retreat just yet.

“If you’re in a performance segment . . . you have to have a 0-to-60 number. This is essential,” Moers insists. He sees the potential of a niche buyer entirely focused on the analog experience but for now aims to deliver cars that do it all. “The definition of our cars is the overall package. How easy is it to drive on the racetrack? Is it predictable? If you drive the car without ESP, just you and the car, can you feel the car? Can you feel the steering? This is what I’m chasing.”

Lamborghini, similarly, hopes to satisfy both camps. Even as it pioneers driving aids like its ALA active aero system, it’s sentimentally holding on to something that has defined Lamborghinis since the beginning: the bold and brash naturally aspirated V-12. “In a supersports car, we have a mission to be the pinnacle of emotion,” Reggiani says. “And emotion is, in part, that when you push the accelerator, you smell fuel, you see vibration, you hear sound, and you are jumping in front like a bullet.” That’s why Lamborghini has announced the replacement for its range-topping Aventador will feature electric assist but retain the V-12.

Porsche has taken a different approach, producing two lines of sports cars at the upper reaches of its portfolio.

Lamborghini

“Track performance and subjective driving pleasure are both important, but in most cases are followed by a different kind of customer,” Preuninger says. “That’s why we branched our GT models into track (GT3 PDK, GT3 RS, GT2 RS) and purist (GT3 with Touring package, GT3 manual, Speedster) offerings.”

Further down the price ladder, Chevrolet also has sought to divide its lineup to appeal to divergent buyer tastes, albeit in a different way. The bow-tie brand would seem perfectly poised to use the tools of modern performance to inject speed into its money-making utility vehicles. Instead, it’s doubling down on tradition. “We’re proud of our Chevrolet SUVs, and we can see why people would make that transition into those vehicles,” says Harlan Charles, product manager for Camaro and Corvette. “Maybe that almost helps us pull even further with the sports cars. To make them even more aggressive in the other direction. To get them to be even more differentiated from a sport utility.” One look at a Corvette ZR1 or Camaro ZL1 certainly bears this out.

Long term, it’s difficult to tell whether the analog performance car will make a comeback or if it will simply become an elite fetish object, like a McIntosh tube amplifier or an artisanal ax.

“The markets will make that decision, and we are watching this development closely,” Preuninger says. Meantime, he doesn’t expect the fierce Nürburgring battles to end soon.

“Mankind is competitive, and the challenge to go faster and to finish first will stay,” he says, “because winning is sexy.”

As our electrified, autonomous, ride sharing future approaches, performance cars and what they deliver in terms of the driving experience still matter. To some of us, they always will. Because humans are human. And these cars, our cars, are the kind that you don’t buy with your brain. You buy them with your heart.

“Speed and performance will become limited, I think. But extinct? Never,” Biermann says. “This is what people love and what they enjoy. And this will not go away. The last vehicle on the planet will be a sports car.”
