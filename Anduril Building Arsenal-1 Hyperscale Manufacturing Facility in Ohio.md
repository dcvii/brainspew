Anduril, a leader in autonomous systems and weapons manufacturing, today announced it has selected Columbus, Ohio as the location of Arsenal-1, its first hyperscale manufacturing facility. Arsenal-1 will redefine the scale and speed that autonomous systems and weapons can be produced for the United States and its allies and partners. This is a monumental and essential step toward rebuilding America’s defense industrial base, strengthening America’s warfighting capabilities, and enhancing deterrence amid rising international threats.

Ohio is the ideal location for Anduril’s first Arsenal factory with its robust infrastructure to support Anduril’s unique needs, a highly skilled and diverse manufacturing workforce, and a legacy of leadership in aerospace and defense. Anduril is investing nearly $1 billion of its own dollars into the development of Arsenal-1 and will bring more than 4,000 direct jobs in the largest single job-creation project in the state’s history.

“Arsenal-1 represents a step forward in how we manufacture the autonomous systems and weapons that our nation and our allies need to remain secure” said Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf. “By harnessing a world-class workforce and a scalable, software-driven approach to manufacturing, Arsenal-1 will set the standard for how we respond to the challenges of the future fight. Ohio’s infrastructure and talent pool make it the ideal home for this historic effort to rebuild the arsenal of democracy.”

“Ohio’s history of advancing aviation, aerospace, and national defense runs deep, but what sets this state apart is our readiness to embrace the future,” said Governor DeWine. “At this critical moment in time, our country needs rapid technological innovation, which Anduril will deliver using Ohio’s skilled, hardworking labor force. The future of American air power will be made in Ohio!”

"Today is a proud day for Ohio as we welcome Anduril and celebrate the creation of thousands of new jobs in cutting-edge defense manufacturing,” said Lt. Governor Jon Husted. “This investment reinforces Ohio's position as a leader in advanced technology and national security. When it comes to 'Made in America,' you can’t do it without 'Made in Ohio.”

**Arsenal-1: A New Standard for Defense Manufacturing**

As the United States and our allies attempt to gain affordable mass with autonomous systems and weapons, the defense industrial base must be capable of producing orders of magnitude more than it is currently producing today. To support that effort, Anduril is hyperscaling weapons manufacturing with Arsenal — a software-defined manufacturing platform that is optimized for the mass production of autonomous systems and weapons.

Arsenal-1 will be the first of its kind: a manufacturing facility that utilizes a common set of commercial manufacturing tooling, machinery, and processes for every type of autonomous vehicle that Anduril produces. Arsenal-1 provides maximum flexibility to reallocate the most critical manufacturing resources — people, capital, machines, and materials — to meet new requirements, launch new products, or scale production to meet surges in demand, indefinitely. The foundation of Arsenal-1 is Arsenal OS, an integrated digital software platform that integrates the design, development, and mass production stages for all Anduril products.

**Anduril & Ohio: Collaborating to Strengthen National Security**

Located next to Rickenbacker Airport, the site provides direct access to two 12,000-foot runways and a 75-acre private apron capable of supporting military-scale aircraft, ensuring rapid delivery of components and systems to our customers. At full scale, the facility will span 5 million square feet and produce tens of thousands of military systems annually. Looking ahead, with more than 500 acres available for future expansion, Arsenal-1 is primed for long-term scalability and will manufacture and produce most of Anduril’s autonomous weapons, sensors and systems at full rate production.

Ohio’s robust workforce, which includes the third largest skilled manufacturing labor pool in the country, further solidifies the state’s appeal. Arsenal-1 is expected to create 4,000 direct high-quality jobs and drive economic growth in Pickaway County and surrounding areas, establishing Ohio as a hub for defense manufacturing. An additional 8,500 jobs from suppliers, construction, and other sectors are expected to support the growth and sustainment of Arsenal-1.

“Anduril and Palmer Luckey are world class innovators, we couldn’t be more excited to have them in Ohio, and our state is open for business,” said Senator Moreno. “Ohio has consistently led the way in manufacturing, and I’m thrilled that Anduril selected Columbus as home to Arsenal-1. This one-of-a-kind facility is a transformative investment and will allow our state to be a leader in developing technology, creating jobs, and strengthening our national security.”

“The future is here in Ohio. Anduril’s investment will transform an empty hangar into a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and provide *thousands* of good paying jobs to Ohioans,” said Rep. Mike Carey of Ohio’s 15th Congressional District. “We thank Governor Mike DeWine for his leadership, which has fostered innovation in our state, and welcome Anduril to Ohio’s 15th District.”

“Ohio is elated to welcome Anduril to our state as a cutting-edge manufacturer of autonomous systems and weapons,” said Rep. Dave Taylor of Ohio’s 2nd Congressional District. “Dating back to when the Wright Brothers first took flight, Ohio has proven itself to be a leader in aerospace, innovation, and defense. This legacy continues as Anduril builds its Arsenal-1 hyperscale manufacturing facility in Columbus and plays a central role in ensuring our United States military is equipped to remain the world’s strongest warfighting machine. By choosing to build its facility here, Anduril can take advantage of our region’s highly skilled workforce and provide thousands of well-paying jobs to Ohioans. Their mission of hyperscaling weapons manufacturing is not only historic but critical to the safety and security of our Nation, and we are proud to welcome them to our region.”

“Anduril’s announcement to create thousands of new jobs throughout Columbus, Ohio, to strengthen our economy, and further establish Ohio's capital as a global hub for aerospace and innovation, is encouraging” said Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio's 3rd Congressional District.

Ohio has a deep-rooted legacy in aerospace and defense innovation and a community aligned with our mission to strengthen national security. Home to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, a critical hub for U.S. Air Force operations and research, the state has long been at the forefront of advancing military capabilities. The Air Force Research Laboratory, also located in Ohio, drives technological breakthroughs in defense, while NASA’s Glenn Research Center and the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility play pivotal roles in aeronautics and space exploration. Additionally, the National Air and Space Intelligence Center and the National Space Intelligence Center further establish Ohio as a center of excellence for both the air and space domains and defense intelligence.

The decision to build Arsenal-1 in Ohio follows an extensive, year-long search process that evaluated numerous locations across the United States and is contingent upon standard due diligence, state and local approvals of incentives, permitting and other legal and regulatory matters. Pending approvals, construction on the facility will begin immediately and the first products will be manufactured beginning in July 2026.

Anduril’s commitment to agile, responsive manufacturing has already been demonstrated globally. Arsenal-1 in Ohio will join Anduril’s other factories including our solid rocket motor factory in Mississippi, our robotic submarine facility in Rhode Island, our launched effects factory in Georgia, our XL-AUV factory in Australia and production facilities in California.
