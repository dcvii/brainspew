VoltaGrid CEO Nathan Ough

Key Points

What's This?

- VoltaGrid, a $4 billion startup, assembles modular, gas-fired power plants, offering quick solutions for data centers and oil frackers.
- CEO Nathan Ough sees President Trump’s policies as boons for VoltaGrid’s growth in the energy sector.
- VoltaGrid is expanding into the data-center market, reaching deals with major developers and exploring partnerships with tech firms.

President ’s ambitions to grow U.S. manufacturing, win the AI race with China and [unleash fossil fuels](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/five-things-to-know-about-trumps-energy-orders-289ad77d?mod=article_inline) will require massive amounts of power. Nathan Ough says he can help.

VoltaGrid, the $4 billion startup he co-founded in Houston, assembles modular, gas-fired power plants in a matter of months. It offers a shortcut to [data centers](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/the-ai-data-center-boom-is-coming-to-americas-heartland-eb060a32?mod=article_inline) and oil frackers that find there isn’t enough capacity on the electric grid for [their expanding needs](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/oil-frackers-electric-power-grid-03f52767?mod=article_inline) and has become one of the U.S.’s fastest-growing power companies.

Ough, 37 years old, is the rare Canadian to voice support for Trump, who has all but incinerated the [U.S.-Canada friendship](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/united-states-canada-hockey-fight-tariffs-trump-trudeau-70177351?mod=article_inline). He says the president’s embrace of fossil fuels, his cutting red tape for data-center development, and his focus on [bringing industries back](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-tariffs-us-global-manufacturing-294b0f55?mod=article_inline) to the U.S. are all boons for VoltaGrid.

“Trump gets up there and says, ‘drill, baby, drill’ and ‘data center,’” said Ough, who is VoltaGrid’s chief executive. “Those are literally the intersection of our entire existence.”

While VoltaGrid mostly services the oil patch, it has entered the data-center market with a bang. It recently reached a deal to deploy more than 1 gigawatt of power across developer Vantage Data Centers’ North American campuses—about as much as San Francisco uses. It also has had discussions with [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL) about potentially electrifying its data centers, according to people familiar with the matter.

Ough says VoltaGrid will spend more than $1 billion over the next 12 to 16 months building power plants.

Founded in 2020, privately held VoltaGrid has operations in a dozen states and employs nearly 1,000. It expects to generate close to $1 billion in revenue this year. The company has the backing of heavyweight investors including Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and oil-field-services company [Halliburton](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HAL).

“I’m not aware of anything quite like that capacity to build a pretty significant power structure in a matter of…days,” said Chris Stewart, a former Republican representative from Utah, who served on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and has spent time with Ough. “What VoltaGrid is doing is critical.”

Some data-center executives say that while VoltaGrid presents an appealing solution to their power woes, the likes of [Meta Platforms](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/META), Google and [Amazon.com](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) have made climate pledges. They might be reluctant to tie the knot with a power company relying on fossil fuels. The companies [are speeding development](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/big-tech-is-rushing-to-find-clean-power-to-fuel-ais-insatiable-appetite-31f91330?mod=article_inline) of new clean-energy sources such as geothermal energy, small nuclear reactors and batteries that store clean power for days.

Ough is a self-described nerd who, as a child, collected extension cords from all over the world. A little-known name inside the energy industry just a few years ago, he now plays matchmaker between Big Tech and Big Oil. He cultivates relationships with Trump allies and makes frequent appearances on conservative media channels—some which have compared him with .

On a March evening at Ough’s Houston home, executives from oil-and-gas companies including [Exxon Mobil](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XOM), [ConocoPhillips](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/COP) and Halliburton shared a dinner of Italian food with senior engineers and officers from Oracle and data-center developers. Also in attendance was Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley.

Ough, who arranged the gathering, said large tech firms have realized they need to tap in to fossil fuels in addition to renewables if they are to build more data centers. Exxon and [Chevron](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CVX) have said they are having discussions with potential data-center customers [to build gas-fired power plants](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/oil-majors-flirt-with-electricity-0d1df707?mod=article_inline).

“You don’t win any AI race if you don’t have power—like, period,” the CEO said. When he visits with lawmakers in Washington, he hands out lapel pins that read, “DATA CENTERS LOVE LOW CARBON FOSSIL FUELS.”

Ough grew up in Saint John, New Brunswick, the stronghold of the [Irving oil dynasty](https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-canada-a-feud-divides-the-irving-family-empire-1407205802?mod=article_inline). While studying for his finance degree, he worked as an analyst at Irving Oil, before joining [Macquarie Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AU/XASX/MQG) as an investment banker.

He was attending an energy conference in Bogotá, Colombia, when he spotted a truck hauling compressed natural gas. He saw an opportunity to develop a similar concept in Canada and, at 23, co-founded Certarus, a company that delivers compressed natural gas to asphalt plants, mines and off-grid communities.

In 2020, he left Certarus—it sold for nearly $800 million, including debt, three years later—to start VoltaGrid. Ough had noticed that oil-and-gas companies were ditching polluting and inefficient diesel generators and moving to electrify their operations. But the grid was struggling to handle this new demand, motivating companies to build their own power systems.

Ough worked with Halliburton to hook up its fracking pumps to bus-size natural-gas generators mounted on trailers, a modular design that allows for rapid deployment. The generators, manufactured in Europe and the U.S. and assembled in Texas, produce electricity that flows through electrical cables and distribution lines. The partnership was a success, and other oil-and-gas companies, including Permian producer [Diamondback Energy](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FANG), have adopted the off-the-grid solution.

About a year and a half ago, big tech companies started calling Ough with inquiries. Within weeks, the CEO set up a data-center sales department.

He has since flown tech executives to West Texas’s oil fields to visit VoltaGrid sites. Ough says a selling point to tech companies is that VoltaGrid’s systems use air scrubbers that capture up to 98% of emissions other than carbon dioxide. The systems can run on hydrogen, which doesn’t produce CO <sub>2</sub> when combusted.

VoltaGrid will spend more than $1 billion over the next 12 to 16 months building power plants for data centers and other customers, Ough says.

“VoltaGrid is definitely front and center in the data-center industry,” said Joseph Walsh, a former data-center executive at Oracle and one of the executive founders of digital-infrastructure developer Montera Infrastructure.

One potential challenge for VoltaGrid is that many of its prospective customers plan to eventually connect to the grid. Ough says he expects the insatiable need for new power means that “bridge” deals signed with his firm will be extended many times over.

In interviews with conservative media channels, he says VoltaGrid’s ability to build city-size power generation means it can help support Trump’s goal to re-onshore industries in the U.S.

Ough says he isn’t a raging conservative, and that his company prospered under former President . Still, he says, he appreciates the Trump administration’s support for fossil fuels. He recently donated nearly $111,000 to the Republican National Committee and plans to travel to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in the coming weeks.

All he wants from the Trump administration is for it to let his company build an electricity empire in the U.S., he says.

“I just want to build s— in America.”
