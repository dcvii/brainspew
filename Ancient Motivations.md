The concept you're referring to comes from ancient philosophical ideas, particularly those of the Greeks and Romans, about the motivations of human behavior. One prominent articulation of these motivations comes from Roman philosopher Cicero, who, influenced by Greek thought, suggested that there are four primary motivations or drives for human action:

1. **Glory (Gloria)**: The desire for fame, honor, and recognition. This motivation drives individuals to seek achievements and accomplishments that will be remembered and admired by others.

2. **Pleasure (Voluptas)**: The pursuit of sensory and physical gratification. This drive encompasses the desire for comfort, enjoyment, and avoidance of pain.

3. **Utility (Utilitas)**: The pursuit of practical benefits and material gain. This includes actions taken to secure wealth, resources, and other tangible assets that provide a direct advantage or benefit.

4. **Virtue (Virtus)**: The aspiration to live a moral and ethical life according to one's principles and values. This motivation is about acting with integrity, courage, justice, and wisdom, often seen as the highest and most noble drive.

These motivations reflect a blend of Stoic and Epicurean influences, with the Stoics emphasizing virtue as the highest good and the Epicureans focusing more on pleasure and utility. Cicero's works, especially "De Officiis" (On Duties), elaborate on these ideas, providing a framework for understanding human behavior in the context of ethical and moral decision-making.

The motivations you're thinking of might be related to another philosophical framework. A common triad of human motivations, especially in discussions about economic behavior and leadership, includes:

1. **Fear**: The drive to avoid danger, loss, or harm. This motivation leads individuals to act out of self-preservation and caution.

2. **Greed**: The desire for wealth, power, and material possessions. This drive pushes individuals to seek personal gain and accumulation of resources, often beyond their immediate needs.

3. **Glory**: The aspiration for recognition, honor, and fame. This motivation encourages individuals to achieve great deeds, gain admiration, and leave a lasting legacy.

These motivations can be traced back to various ancient thinkers and have been discussed by philosophers, historians, and political theorists. In particular, Thucydides, the ancient Greek historian, famously analyzed human motivations in his work "History of the Peloponnesian War," identifying fear, honor (a form of glory), and self-interest (which can be related to greed) as primary drivers of human action.

In summary, the three motivations you mentioned—fear, greed, and glory—reflect a longstanding tradition in both Greek and Roman thought about the fundamental forces shaping human behavior.

Exactly! Cicero's four motivations—glory, pleasure, utility, and virtue—provide a broad ethical framework, while Thucydides' three motivations—fear, greed, and glory—offer a more focused analysis of human behavior, particularly in the context of politics and conflict. These two perspectives complement each other, providing a comprehensive understanding of the various forces that drive human actions in different contexts.
