Today’s rant is brought to you by a retired engineer who lives with a washing machine from hell.

Why is my grouchy consumer complaint relevant to readers of Heterodox STEM? Because of the extraordinary amount of science and engineering it must have taken to make a product this bad. Science and engineering dragooned into service by regulators determined to drive us back to the Stone Age.

The machine in question is the Whirlpool front-load washer, model number WFW560CHW. This affront to modern man was foisted upon us by our cheapskate condo developer, who must have gotten some kind of deal on 150 of these abominations.

The saga of how this machine came to be is too long and complex to recount here. I will instead refer you to a 14-page Perplexity AI [research study](https://babblingbeaver.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Whirlpool-Washer.pdf) that details the 24-year arc of Department of Energy appliance regulations. These challenged scientists and engineers to build a washing machine that only uses 13 gallons of water to properly wash a load of clothes, compared to pre-moron machines of the same size that use 20-40 gallons.

Spoiler alert. You cannot properly wash a load of clothes using only 13 gallons of water. What you can do is make them damp and smelly, grow mold and mildew in your washing machine, and incubate athlete’s foot fungus in your bath towels.

My heart goes out to the scientists and engineers forced to employ their skills to produce this embarrassment. How they deal with their shame is their own affair. But if you carefully observe the machine then dig into its guts in an effort to hack it back to acceptable performance, you can see that they made extraordinary efforts. Kludges made possible only by modern sensing and software control technologies adapted from products and industries not going through compelled retrogression.

The prime directive they worked under was getting clothes as clean as possible while staying below the [EPA Integrated Water Factor (IWF)](https://www.energystar.gov/products/clothes_washers/key_product_criteria) limit. The fact that your clothes come out smelly tells you that their definition of “clean” is similar to the regulators’ definition of “sane.”

When you first turn this thing on it does a complicated rotational dance to determine the weight of the load. It then rations out water accordingly. Do not try to find a knob or button to adjust the water level. This would violate the regulators’ intent of emasculating the consumer. Do not try to open up the machine to find internal adjustments or set screws to increase the water level. The regulators thought of such workarounds and made them verboten.

Instead, you must be satisfied to impotently watch barely damp clothes with obvious dry spots flop around for hours pretending to get washed. Don’t expect to actually see water and suds.

But wait, there’s more.

*The machine does not even dispense enough water to keep itself clean*. Periodically, it reminds you to use the “Clean Washer” cycle, adding special sanitation products you must buy to eliminate the biofilm, mold, mildew, and lint gunk that builds up inside the drum.

Adding insult to injury, when you turn on the Clean Washer cycle the machine dispenses a Niagara of water to flush away its sins. Does this water consumption count when determining whether the machine complies with the IWF limit? Nope. The regulations contain a loophole that specifically excludes remedial self-washing.

There must be a way a determined engineer can take matters into his own hands seeking laundry justice! Sure enough, a YouTube search reveals that there is.

Behold, a 23-minute how-to video titled [Hacking the Pressure Switch: Add Water to High-Efficiency Washers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2qSMurPZRE) posted by some good old boy. It explains how to do major surgery on a machine’s pneumatic sensing system to make it do what you want. Despite the effort and risk of destroying the machine, I considered it just for the satisfaction of defying the morons. But my sensible bride vetoed taking such extreme measures.

And so, each time I do a load of wash I have to use a watering can to add four of five gallons of extra water through the detergent port to have any hope of getting my clothes clean. Cussing all the way, grateful that the morons have not yet forced me to reduce my energy consumption and water use by beating my clothes on rocks on the banks of the river.
