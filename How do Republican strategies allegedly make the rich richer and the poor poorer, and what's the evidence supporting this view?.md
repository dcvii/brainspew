How do Republican strategies allegedly make the rich richer and the poor poorer, and what's the evidence supporting this view?

Rich people leverage labor, capital, or both. I grew up in a very poor family in the poorest neighborhood in Houston. Our school coach called us Heights Rats. We thought it was a compliment. My uncle was a rancher. Later in life, I accidentally learned my uncle had given us free beef over many years. This was done in total secrecy. Growing up, we sometimes had huge T-bone steaks, baked potatoes, and pecan pie. That was a big deal! Looking back, I now realize we never could have afforded those meals. When I was 10 years old, a construction guy put a yellow marker on the abandoned firehouse next to my home. (Houston has no zoning.) I said: Hey, Mister. What is that marker? We are demolishing this place first thing Monday morning. Can I have some of the bricks? Sure, kid. Take all you want. These bricks are going to the county dump. But get what you want this weekend. Monday morning, bulldozers and dump trucks arrive 7 AM. You cannot be around here while they are working. The 1960s were a different time in America. My brothers, cousins, and I used sledgehammers and wheelbarrows. We worked like ants. We filled our backyard and the vacant lot next door with bricks. Enormous piles. We did not know what we would do with the bricks. But we knew they were free. Texans are big believers in: Mind your own business. No one interrupted our work. No one even asked what we were doing. When that demolition crew arrived Monday morning, they were probably shocked to discover much of the job had already been completed. Within four days, my Dad found a contractor who would pay 10 cents for each brick. But they had to be cleaned. No mortar hanging off. This contractor built circular driveways. Circular driveways were sophisticated in the 1960s. These were especially popular in River Oaks. Wealthy oil men lived there. We never ventured that far. For us, River Oaks could have been on Pluto. So I offered all my buddies 4 cents each to clean the bricks. My fastest workers could make four bucks an hour. That was an unbelievable amount of money for kids in the fifth grade. Godzilla triple features at the Yale Theater only cost 35 cents. The air conditioning alone was worth 35 cents. When it was 104 degrees outside, our table fans at home did little good. We cleaned the bricks using hammers, chisels, and hatchets. No one wore safety glasses. We had no idea safety glasses existed. My friends were delighted to have a paying job. Mom made us lemonade and oatmeal cookies. We tried chocolate chip. But the heat melted chocolate all over the bricks. We sat in a circle and horsed around. It was more fun than work. We had constant contests: Fastest bricks Cleanest bricks Fewest chips My favorite was the Cleaver contest. The winner was the one who could completely clean the side of a brick with one perfect stroke of the hatchet. I was Supervisor. But my best friend objected: Why do you get 6 cents for doing nothing, while the rest of us get 4 cents for doing all the work? My people skills were rough. I replied: Take it or leave it, Donkey Breath. I suspected my best friend was a Communist—though I had no idea what that might be. From Walter Cronkite, I knew there were Communist Gorillas in Vietnam. Eventually, my best friend came around. He decided to clean bricks, too. So I had 8 kids working for me. He later became a highly respected professor at Rice University. Back then, the rule was: Everyone had to get home before the street lights came on. My buddies and I could go on 6-hour adventures without our parents knowing where we were. As mentioned, it was a different era. Our assembly line was soon humming. We delivered bricks daily. As we say in the South: We were cooking with gas. But we were also generating lots of chips and dust in the process. My refuse pile was growing. On Wednesday afternoons, a garbage truck came by. Each homeowner was limited to three garbage cans. There is a solution to every problem! If we met the garbage men with ice-cold cans of Dr. Pepper and Coca-Cola, they would empty extra trash cans. The very first week, I learned the importance of “winning over” the driver. My brother said I was bribing public officials. Dad assured me I would not be arrested. On Sunday mornings, we walked to church wearing our best clothes. Clean and starched. The moment we got home, I raced to put on regular clothes. One Sunday afternoon, Mom caught us working on the bricks. This upset her. We were breaking the 10 Commandments. We immediately stopped working. Dad said: Don’t worry, son. You can still beat Howard Hughes working 6 days a week. Then, he winked at me. That is how I made a small fortune at age 10. With a lot of help from: City of Houston A kind construction supervisor Wonderful buddies Hard-working garbage men My brothers and cousins Mom & Dad Bottom Line Poor people do not. Answers to Questions in Comments Yes. I am now rich. We have employees in Texas, California, District of Columbia, and four countries overseas. No. I eat few steaks, but lots of pie. Pie is one of my 4 major food groups. Yes. Our mission is to do business according to the Holy Bible. Yes. We took unfair advantage of whomever owned the vacant lot where we stored bricks. No. I no longer call people Donkey Breath. Not to their faces anyway. Yes. The Heights was a very poor neighborhood in the 1960s. The area has been completely revitalized. The Heights skipped gentrification and went straight to luxury. Our neighbors in the 1960s were steel fabrication yards and freight trains. I have witnessed three major turnarounds in my lifetime: East Palo Alto, California Baltimore Harbor, Maryland Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania The renaissance in the Heights was almost as amazing. Of course, the irony is this: I travelled all over the world trying to make it big. But I would have made more money if I had stayed home — loading the boat with vacant lots and rundown houses in the Heights. 7 days later. More questions… Yes. People in River Oaks had elaborate and beautiful Christmas lights. Many Houstonians drove there to see those displays. People in the Heights could not afford Christmas lights. Yes. Yale Theater is still there. But there are no more triple features or buckets of popcorn for 35 cents. No. We did not cause environmental problems by recycling the bricks. No. We did not create a “tragedy of the commons” by taking free bricks. Yes. I believed there were Communist Gorillas in Vietnam. I never said I was smart. Yes. It is still possible to get rich in 2025 starting with nothing. No. If you want to be poor, do what poor people do. If you want to be rich, do what rich people do. Yes. There is a millionaire mindset. But it is not about positive thinking. Here is the real mindset for success. Determine the price — the full price — required to achieve your goals. Then, resolve fully and completely to pay that price. Big goals create big problems. You will need grit and steel. Not happy talk and rainbows. 11 days later. More questions… Yes. We knew the Corll family. Their shop was across from Helms Elementary. My Little League team practiced at Helms. Yes. I knew Elmer Wayne Henley. He was in Boy Scouts (Troop 24). But Wayne had long hair. My Dad was ex-military— Old School military. My brothers and I had buzz cuts until we left home. Mom gave us haircuts in the kitchen. Dad said Wayne was a “hippie or worse.” We were not allowed to have any contact with him. Yes. Howard Hughes was from Houston. His family members still live in the area. He was the richest man in the world for awhile. When I drove a flatbed truck, I made “Hot Shot” deliveries to Hughes Tool Company. Those paid 2x the normal rate. In Texas, an eccentric billionaire is called a real character. They can be found all over the state. In the 1950s, the richest man in the world was H.L. Hunt. He would hand out free copies of his anti-Communist book at the Texas State Fair. He would personally talk with fair visitors for 8 hours at a time. Mr. Hunt did not like pie. He liked carrot cake. Everywhere he went, he carried two pieces in a brown paper bag. As he and his lawyer drove to inspect oil fields, he would stop at a roadside stand to buy a watermelon for lunch. The two men would split the melon. His lawyer said: Mr. Hunt always haggled with farmers. He refused to pay more than 75 cents. Mr. Hunt’s neighbor was even more eccentric. While his wife and daughters were vacationing in Europe, he refrigerated part of his mansion. His family returned to a chilly home — and a squadron of indoor/outdoor penguins. Below is the richest man in the world in 2025. In the 1970s, Jeff Bezos and I were classmates in Houston at Vanguard (public school). That is his grandfather on the porch. Their family owns a cattle ranch outside Cotulla. Jeff was always brilliant. Like most billionaires, he is a real character. His Dad is on the right. Jeff worked cattle as a teenager. We all did. Here is a little-known parenting tip… If you want your C-minus student to become an A-plus student, let him work one summer as a cowboy. Why does Texas generate so much wealth? Peculiar culture! Texans openly admire rich people. It has been that way for 200 years. Texans have zero sympathy for slackers and whiners. No state income tax. No corporate income tax. No inheritance tax. No grocery tax. It’s nutty to tax people who work hard to give freebies to people who do nothing. Looking right at you, California. Texans value law and order. That is good for business, bad for hoodlums. 15 days later. More questions… No. Moving from the Bottom 1% to the Top 1% will never be easy. But I did it. My brothers did it. My cousin did it. You can do it, too! Yes. The United States is still full of amazing opportunities. Anyone who is willing to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week can become wealthy. Yes. Monty Burns and I are similar — though I have more hair. Good luck to you!

Look at it from the perspective of the state. The state wants to grow. Everyone wants a larger budget. The politicians want it because it allows them to buy more votes and pay back more donors. The generals and the defense contractors want it because it allows them to buy and sell more war machines. The bureaucrats want it because it provides job security. Everyone in the state has a reason for wanting the state to grow, and behind this all lies the true reason: power.

With a single tax rate there is a limit to how high taxes can go and still be supported by a majority of voters. It is hard to

This is a very timely and good question. In recent last 10 years, there seems to be something wrong with capitalism which results in the new generation to remain poor despite working hard. While I am not sure if the rich get richer, the poor seems to be poorer in the current system.

The basic appeal of capitalism is that if you work hard, you can be successful economically. This is the basis of the American Dream which allows the younger generation without much accumulated wealth to succeed equally versus the older generation. Unfortunately, this has not worked out for the current younger gener

The poor don’t consistently get poorer. Largely driven by China and other parts of Asia, we have seen both the relative and absolute numbers of extremely poor people in the world reduce over decades:[Mark Harrison](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Harrison-2)

Capitalism moves and aggregates wealth uphill, because returns exceed growth. R>G. In other words, wealth, for the wealthy, builds faster than the system as a whole grows. It is only a matter of time before the unregulated system tips over.

We see from the work of people like Piketty and Stiglitz, that capitalism works best when lightly regulated and progressively taxed, to redistribute wealth on purpose, keeping the economic engine fueled for everyone, rather than starving it.

The end result is a slightly smaller percentage of a much larger pie, for the wealthy, which is far more than most of a

I’ve never seen any politician propose legislation that would, for example, create a new tax cut for only those earning more than $400,000. What you generally see is that a tax cut is proposed that lowers taxes for a broad swath of taxpayers, but the wealthy, because they pay far more in taxes, end up benefiting as well.

This is very difficult to avoid, given that the very wealthy pay...

In fast growing economies loans do help to make the rich richer and poor poorer because governments have a higher tolerance for inflation as they chase growth. This is how it works. A businessman borrows Rs 10000000 and uses the money to set up a manufacturing unit an raw materials. This money comes from the savings of thousands of savers who are not eligible for loans. As banks continue to give loans the demand for machinery and land goes up. This means that the same plant and machinery will cost more. If the price doubles, it means that inflation has helped to write off the businessman’s deb

No. The data does not support this conclusion.

I think, it generally does not happen.

What some people do to say so is compare the absolute amounts got by rich and poor.

A 1% increase in case of a poor earning $10,000 is $ 100. This same increase in case of a lowest level millionnaire at an earning of $1 million is $10,000, i.e. equal to the earning of the poor which looks very capitalist.

If inflation during this period is 2%, obviously the poor

It has to do with an attitude towards money. The rich and the poor both handle their money very differently and with different priorities. Google search and listen to Ruby Payne and her many talks about living in poverty. It explains the issue very well.
