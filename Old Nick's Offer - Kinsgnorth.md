This 6th-century mosaic, in the Basilica of Sant’ Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna, Italy, may be the earliest depiction of the devil. Christ stands flanked by two angels: one in red, tending His sheep, and one in blue, rounding up the goats. The blue angel is Satan. Only the goats have cloven feet.

I enjoy thinking about the devil. This is probably not a thing I should say, but there it is. I don’t enjoy it because I imagine that he is a sexily dangerous and attractively transgressive figure - I’ll leave that up to the [entertainment industry.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=Uq9gPaIzbe8&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=SamSmithVEVO) Rather, I enjoy thinking about him because it feels like the devil is a puzzle to be solved. A key to something. A key, maybe, to the religion I find myself entwined in.

The devil is unfashionable these days, which is probably how he likes it. Society as a whole has long scoffed at the notion of demonic beings, and many Christians seem to shuffle a bit in their seats too when he is mentioned. This is not the case in the Orthodox world, where Old Nick, as we call him in England, remains as visible as he was in the West in the Middle Ages. We modern types, though, prefer our Christianity scrubbed of the awkward bits. Hell, demons, angels, cherubim, seraphim, giants, talking serpents, wonderworking saints, the raising of the dead: all of these are absolutely central to the Christian understanding of reality, but we tend to cough and look the other way when any of it is brought up. ‘Heaven’ we can just about cope with; and God, who is usefully distant; and Jesus, just about, though we do like to bend him into whatever shape suits us. But the rest of it: we don’t like it. And we don’t like the devil most of all.

‘Devil’ is a word you won’t find in the Bible - unsurprisingly, as it stems from the Germanic speech of the Anglo-Saxons, who later became the English and spread the word around the world. It’s a translation of the Greek _diabolos_, which pops up in the original text in a few places, but never with much clarity. Quite a lot of things we might think we know about this ‘devil’, in fact, don’t appear in the Bible either. That he was cast out of Eden with Adam and Eve; that he manifested as a snake in the Garden; that he is synonymous with Lucifer (a name which literally means ‘light bringer’ and which, in the Revelation of St John, is applied to Christ Himself); that he governs ‘hell’ (another non-Biblical word, this time from the Norse) along with an army of demons: unless I’m mistaken - and please tell me if I am - none of this is actually found in the text.

But then, the devil’s job is to confuse people.

Who is this ‘devil’ then? In the New Testament, we meet a figure called ‘the adversary’ or ‘the accuser’ or ‘the tempter’. This person - and he is a person: not an ‘archetype’ or a ‘symbol’, but a real, living presence - stands against everything God wants for humanity, as he stands against God himself. He is all about power: power and dissolution. He is, in short, anti-life.

In the New Testament we meet him early, in the fourth chapter of Matthew’s Gospel. Jesus, after his baptism, is ‘led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.’ Sentences like that are the reason I enjoy thinking about the devil. Note that Jesus was _led_ into the wilderness by ‘the Spirit.’ That would be the Holy Spirit, or what Christians call the ‘third person of the Trinity’. The devil didn’t just pop up while Jesus was meditating in the desert. Christ was specifically _taken_ to him - by the Spirit of God, no less - to be tested before his work began.

What did that test involve? Well, the adversary, it turns out, likes to make offers. He’s like a businessman trying to cut a deal. There is no fire and brimstone, and there are no threats. Instead, the tempter simply offers us what is most likely to tempt us. In the case of Christ, he makes three offers. First, the chance to show off his abilities by turning stones into food. Second, the chance to throw himself from the ‘pinnacle of the temple’ and survive by divine intervention. And finally, the big one: old-fashioned political _power_. ‘All the kingdoms of the world’, in fact, which Jesus and Old Nick will govern together, if only Christ will pledge allegiance to the adversary rather than the creator.

It is this last temptation that intrigues me most, and it’s partly because of what the devil says to Christ as he makes the offer, according to Luke:

> _Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said to Him, “All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours.”_

The devil is making a specific claim here: not just that he is ‘the prince of this world’, but that the world has been _given_ to him. He, in turn, can give it to whoever he wishes. When he makes this claim, Jesus does not contradict him.

Who could ‘give’ the world to the devil? Presumably only God. Presumably also, this is the result of the ‘Fall of Man’ - another concept that the Bible doesn’t specifically lay out, but which later Christians have proposed as the pattern of reality. Before the expulsion from Eden, we are told, humans lived in communion with God. But their choice to deliberately disobey him was a choice to walk away from the path of life - the pattern of the ‘Tao’, as C. S. Lewis had it - and to walk in the way of death and dissolution instead. As a result, humans are expelled from the garden and forced to live in a world where flesh decays, and pain and conflict are the norm.

It’s hard to over-emphasise the importance of this, it seems to me. I think this is why I keep coming back to it. Traditional Christianity is making a very specific claim here about this elusive ‘devil’ figure: that _he is running the show._ Jesus is clear about this at the end of his ministry as well as the beginning. In Book 14 of John’s Gospel, as Christ and the disciples await the arrival of the Temple authorities and the Roman soldiers who will take him away to be crucified, Jesus says:

> _I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me. But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go from here._

_The ruler of this world is coming._ Again, we see that God’s adversary - the enemy of created life, and the enemy of humanity - is in fact _in charge of the world we currently live in._ He tried to tempt Jesus, and he tries to tempt us: daily, hourly, we assume. Christ’s resurrection, we are taught, foredooms him: when the end comes, he will be toast. But so will those of us who fell for his temptations along the way. And meanwhile, he is still keeping himself busy down here.

All of this fascinates me, because even many Christians reject this part of the story. One survey of believers on the subject a decade or so back, for example, found that 40% of them agreed with the statement that the devil ‘is not a living being but is a symbol of evil.’[1](https://paulkingsnorth.substack.com/p/fear-and-old-nick?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=250836&post_id=138033793&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=7br8e&triedRedirect=true#footnote-1-138033793) This is the modern, psychologised take on the matter: a therapeutic Christianity in which all of the tricky bits are given a Jungian or mythic framing. _Obviously_, we tell ourselves, _none of this is actually_ real_. We’re all grown-ups here, after all. These are just symbols and archetypes, useful in navigating the reality of our psyches._ Thus does Modern Man - or rather, Modern Christian Man - reconcile his faith with the dominant faith of secular modernity

Unfortunately, this is not what the actual Christian faith has ever taught. Instead it has taught, then as now, that some _actual being_ is out there, working to draw us away from the centre; away from the creator and his Tao. If the purpose of a human life is, as the Orthodox teach, _theosis_ - union with God - then the devil’s work is to get in the way, by any means necessary. If we reject this part of the story, it seems to me, the rest of it doesn’t make sense. Who is Christ supposed to be referring to when he talks of the ‘Prince of this world’? Who is his resurrection supposed to defeat? What is evil, and who makes it happen? If the devil is now just an ‘archetype’ or a ‘symbol’, are we to say the same thing about Jesus - or God?

No: without the tempter, the whole picture falls apart.

I didn’t plan to write about the devil when I got up this morning. I was prompted to do so by thinking about something that has been troubling me for a few days: _fear_. At my church last weekend, the priest gave a short, sharp sermon about this. He was referring to the fear people are currently expressing about events in the Middle East, but he could just as easily have been referring to the fear we were soaked in before that by events in Ukraine; or before that, during the pandemic; or before that, during the economic collapse. More to the point, if we lived elsewhere in the world - the Congo, say, or West Papua or plenty of other places we know little or nothing about - we would be facing terrors daily that our media are not telling us about because they are not deemed to be sufficiently newsworthy.

‘Fear’, said the priest, ‘is not Orthodox.’

His point was not that all is rosy. The point was that things have never been rosy. The devil is the prince of this world, and even a cursory glimpse at human history makes it hard to avoid the conclusion that war is our natural state and peace a rare attainment. Why else would God need to manifest in human form? War, conquest, hatred: this is what we do, all the time. Terrible things happen. Terrible people carry them out. And we are allmuch more capable than we tell ourselves of becoming those terrible people. We just need to be driven to it. By fear.

Fear is everywhere now because, more reliably than anything else, it generates clicks. If we react to this fear, as we are intended to, it will very quickly curdle into hatred, and the hatred will then be directed at the people we are afraid of. Sometimes we are right to be afraid of them, but even if we are, our hatred can very quickly spiral out of control. This week, for example, I have seen ‘Christians’ in some corners of the Internet calling for the mass murder of Palestinian civilians in response to Hamas’s hideous pogrom. In other places I could just as easily find Muslims - and indeed non-Muslims - calling for the death of all Jews. The easiest thing to do if you are afraid is to want to wipe out the source of your fear. But where, once you have started, are you going to stop?

Fear begets hatred. Hatred begets human history. This makes the devil smile.

What is the alternative? Freedom from fear. To some degree, I think, this involves a different attitude to death. To the Christian - to any religious person, in fact - death is not the end. This life is a testing ground. We are here to be tempted, not least by our fears. [St Porphyrios of Kavsokalyvia](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Porphyrios_(Bairaktaris)_the_Kapsokalivite), my favourite modern saint, put it simply, as he put everything: ‘death does not exist’, he said, ‘do not fear death.’ But we do. And that fear - of death, of pain, of loss - drives all of our small, crabbed hatreds. Is this why Christ tells his followers repeatedly to jettison the things of this world - wealth, family, home, stability, comfort - in order to follow him? I think it must be. These attachments breed all the passions: vanity, vainglory, greed, fear, anger, hatred. We have to let them all go.

Easier said than done.

But here we are, trying to be Christians, and this is the calling. There is no getting away from it. There is Christ’s way, which is to live without fear, to walk through the world as strangers, to love enemy and neighbour alike, to put God first always, to be prepared for death at any moment. And then there is the devil’s way, which is to cling on to earthly things, to accumulate more and more of them, to fear their loss and ours, and to hate those who threaten us, or are perceived to.

How are we supposed to do any of this? Well, the point is that we have help. We are not facing the devil alone. Just before he faces the ‘ruler of this world’ for the final time, Jesus sums up for his disciples how they can find the escape hatch from the kingdom of fear:

> _Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. You have heard Me say to you, ‘I am going away and coming back to you.’ If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ for My Father is greater than I._

Let not your heart be troubled. Live without fear. Easy to say, hard to do. But it is possible; and when it happens, even for a moment, the lightness of heart is palpable. The devil’s grip is loosened. He has worked so hard, beaming terror into our brains down the wires and through the screens. But it turns out that, like Jesus in the wilderness, there is a simple way out: we can just say no.

To do this, I find that it helps to remember what Christianity actually teaches, and always has: that the devil is, in fact, real. That there is an anti-God force, an anti-life force, abroad in the universe, and that more often than not we serve that force with our actions. When I find myself serving that force - doing the devil’s work - which is quite often, I try to take a step back and remind myself of my favourite line in the entire Bible:

> _In the world you will have troubles; but be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world._

That’s real warrior spirituality, right there. Through self-sacrifice, even death itself can be conquered. Even the devil can be vanquished. And if it is true - well, maybe even fear can be conquered in the end.# Old Nick's Offer
