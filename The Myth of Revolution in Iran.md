There is a difference between a revolution and a counterrevolution. It is a recurrent mistake of the American media to conflate the two. That is because the success of 1776—the 250th anniversary of which we celebrate this year—predisposes us to sympathize with revolutions. I can think of no better explanation for the naivete of much liberal commentary on subsequent revolutions: France in 1789, Russia in 1917, China in 1949, Cuba in 1959, Nicaragua in 1979, Egypt in 2011 and, most relevant to today, Iran in 1979.

Let it never be forgotten that, in *The* *New York Times* on [February 16, 1979](https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/16/archives/trusting-khomeini.html), the Princeton professor Richard Falk confidently asserted: “The depiction of \[the Ayatollah Khomeini\] as fanatical, reactionary, and the bearer of crude prejudices seems certainly and happily false. What is also encouraging is that his entourage of close advisers is uniformly composed of moderate, progressive individuals.” Moreover, “the key appointees” in the new revolutionary government had “a notable record of concern for human rights and seem eager to achieve economic development that results in a modern society oriented on satisfying the whole population’s basic needs.”

“Having created a new model of popular revolution based, for the most part, on nonviolent tactics,” Falk gushed, “Iran may yet provide us with a desperately needed model of humane governance for a third‐world country.”

Nope.

It turns out the commentators Falk was refuting were right. Khomeini really was “fanatical, reactionary, and the bearer of crude prejudices.” They were also right to associate him “with efforts to turn the clock back 1,300 years, with virulent antisemitism, and with a new political disorder, ‘theocratic fascism,’ about to be set loose on the world.” As there is no accountability whatsoever for liberal professors, Falk was subsequently appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council as Special Rapporteur on the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories. The Iranian people, meanwhile, have endured close to 47 years of theocratic fascism.

As I write, no one knows how many thousands of Iranian citizens have been slaughtered by the Islamic Republic’s secret police and religious militias, three days after Khomeini’s successor, Ali Khamenei, unleashed them against protesters. The regime [acknowledges 2,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I2Qq3hP0zg). The opposition website Iran International puts the [death toll at 12,000](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601130145). All we can say for sure is that the regime is remaining true to the principle on which it was founded: a merciless intolerance of dissent. Not for the first time, Khamenei is preserving the achievements of the 1979 revolution by means of a massacre.

There is a pattern here. Consistently, going all the way back to the French Revolution in 1789, American liberals have underestimated the illiberal character of most revolutions. Equally consistently, they have disparaged the counterrevolutionaries who seek to overturn those illiberal revolutions. This leads to confused analysis of events such as those currently unfolding in Iran.

The American instinct is to frame the protests against the regime of the Islamic Republic as revolutionary, as Karim Sadjadpour and Jack A. Goldstone do in an [otherwise excellent essay](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/iran-revolution-protests-collapse/685578/) for *The Atlantic*. But the protests are in fact counterrevolutionary. Their goal is to overturn the 1979 revolution and replace the current Islamic regime. Some elements openly aspire to restore the monarchy. Reza Pahlavi, the eldest son of the shah deposed in 1979, is egging on the protesters from the United States, where he has long lived in exile.

The 1979 revolution was a radical one. Khomeini’s 1970 book, *Islamic Government*, laid out the argument for the clerical dictatorship he would establish nine years later. In Shia Islam, it said, righteous descendants of Muhammad—the Imams—are the only legitimate rulers of the Islamic world. In the year 873, however, the 12th Imam disappeared, breaking the chain of succession. Khomeini argued that until the 12th Imam returns, the clergy must rule, with one cleric, selected by his peers, serving as supreme leader.

Going all the way back to the French Revolution in 1789, American liberals have underestimated the illiberal character of most revolutions.

But Iranian society is no longer aligned with the revolution’s implied return to the 9th century.

Iran has become a highly literate ([close to 90 percent](https://www.worldatlas.com/society/countries-by-literacy-rate.html)), highly urbanized ([close to 80 percent](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Percentage-of-Irans-urban-and-rural-population-in-1950-2050-According-to-the-Human_fig3_349833615)) society since 1979. Women’s access to education and birth control has hugely increased; fertility has plummeted. The vast majority of Iranians were born after the Islamic Revolution. [Seventy percent favor](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/16/5/592) separation of religion and state. Far from being a Muslim version of Gilead from *The Handmaid’s Tale*, Iran has ended up more like a Western, secularized society than any other country in the Middle East.

I am sure Sadjadpour and Goldstone are right about the basic reason for the widespread dissatisfaction with the regime. An [inflation rate](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202512280124) of 50 percent—and 70 percent for food—would make any kind of government unpopular. They are right, too, that ordinary Iranians are disgusted by the corruption and hypocrisy of today’s political elite. (Take a look at [the Rich Kids of Tehran](https://www.instagram.com/therichkidsoftehran/) on Instagram for some choice examples.) The 1979 revolution, like the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the Maoist revolution in China, began with austere dogma but swiftly descended into graft.

Yet the people in the streets of Iran today do not aspire to build Utopia; they just want the old Iran back—an idealized, nostalgia-tinged version, no doubt, but above all a country of stability, not ideology. Hence [the chant](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601091066): “Neither Gaza nor Lebanon; my life for Iran.” Aside from the failure of its economic policy, nothing has alienated people more than the catastrophic blowback from the regime’s ideologically driven policy of funding terrorist proxies to wage war on Israel.

I have long been a proud counterrevolutionary. As an undergraduate in the 1980s I developed a loathing of all communist regimes and exulted when so many came tumbling down in the *annus mirabilis* of 1989. Had I been around in the 18th century, I would doubtless have been [a Jacobite](https://www.nts.org.uk/learning/adult-learning/jacobites). But I have no illusions about the difficulty of mounting a successful counterrevolution.

True restorations are few and far between. The Stuarts managed it in 1660, when King Charles II [was invited](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/restoration-charles-ii) to resume his father’s throne after the descent of a brief republican experiment into Oliver Cromwell’s Puritan dictatorship. The French Bourbons managed it in 1814–1815, when King Louis XVIII returned to enjoy the magnificent palaces from which his brother Louis XVI had been driven. The Spanish Bourbons also achieved restoration in 1874 after a republican interlude.

But in each case these restored regimes were fragile and ephemeral. Charles II’s brother James II was ousted in the [1688 Glorious Revolution](https://www.history.com/articles/glorious-revolution). Louis XVI’s brother Charles X was ousted in the 1830 Revolution. And the Spanish monarchy was overthrown again in 1931—and not restored other than nominally until King Juan Carlos assumed royal duties in 1975. The only other example that comes to mind is that of Cambodia, where Norodom Sihanouk [was restored](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/09/24/Sihanouk-reinstated-as-king-of-Cambodia/1711748843200/) in 1993, following his country’s long and hellish nightmare of war, civil war, and genocide.

More numerous are the cases when revolutionary regimes gave way to novel forms of authoritarian rule. Napoleon’s ascent from First Consul to Emperor began in 1799, 10 years after the French Revolution began. History repeated itself in 1852, when the republic established in the 1848 Revolution yielded to the ambitions of Napoleon’s nephew, and France [became an empire again](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Second-Empire). Similar things occurred in the 1920s and 1930s. Sometimes, as in Italy, monarchs accepted fascist dictators to defend them against the socialist threat. In other cases, notably Germany, the dictator amassed all power to himself. There were numerous authoritarian coups in the Cold War—in Indonesia [in 1965–1966](https://hmh.org/education/indonesia-1965-1966/), for example, and in Chile in 1973. But these were not restorations. In the eyes of a true counterrevolutionary, they were Bonapartist regimes unlikely to have much staying power.

Looking back on the events of 1989–1990 as a counterrevolutionary, I see now that they were without exception failed opportunities. All that really happened was that communist republics became more or less liberal ones. Even the most conservative of the former Warsaw Pact states, Hungary, is still a long way from bringing back [Habsburg rule](https://www.habsburger.net/en). I suspect the current Habsburgs are much too liberal for Viktor Orbán’s taste. And only in his own fantasies is Vladimir Putin a real czar.

Those Middle Eastern and North African countries that have remained monarchies (Jordan, Morocco, and the Gulf states) have clearly led much more tranquil lives since World War II than the ones that became republics (Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen). Yet I hear almost no discussion of restoring the monarchy in any of these latter countries apart from Iran. And I shall be very surprised if this ever becomes the policy of Donald Trump’s administration, attractive though the president himself [finds the institution of monarchy](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/king-trump-rcna192912).

The harsh reality is, therefore, that most counterrevolutions fail. That was true in the Vendée in 1793–1796, when the devout peasants opposed to the new regime in Paris were slaughtered by the revolutionaries. It was true in the Russian Civil War, when the White armies ultimately failed to oust the Bolsheviks from what had been St. Petersburg. The militarist-monarchist forces that tried to get rid of the Weimar Republic at the time of [Wolfgang Kapp’s 1920 putsch](https://www.britannica.com/event/Kapp-Putsch) foundered in the face of a general strike.

The Cold War made it painfully clear, time and time again, that repression works. When a revolutionary regime deploys its internal security forces and, if necessary, its army against protesters, the protesters nearly always lose and end up either dead, detained or, if they are lucky, dispersed. That was true in Budapest in 1956, in Prague in 1968, in Gdańsk in 1981, and in Beijing in 1989. Communist regimes have a playbook for stamping out dissent.

Take [an example](https://soviethistory.msu.edu/1961/novocherkassk-massacre/) you have probably never heard of. Novocherkassk, in the Rostov region of Russia, is the historic capital of the Don Cossack region, and had a track record of hostility to the Bolsheviks. On June 1, 1962, the workers at the Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Works went on strike after the government under Nikita Khrushchev announced nationwide price increases for meat and butter. The price hikes coincided with pay cuts at the factory. Thousands of striking workers marched to the Communist Party headquarters in the city center and occupied the building, demanding to speak with officials. Soviet Army soldiers, MVD internal troops, and KGB units opened fire on the demonstrators, killing 24 and severely wounding 69. More than 100 people were later convicted after show trials for “mass disorders” and “banditry.” Seven were sentenced to death. Bear in mind that this happened 45 years after the outbreak of the Russian Revolution—roughly the same distance we are today from the Iranian Revolution.

The Soviet Union is a distant memory—for the simple reason that Mikhail Gorbachev threw the playbook of repression away—but the former KGB operative who is now Russia’s president has not forgotten it. Nor have the spawn of the Bolsheviks who continue to batten off the peoples of Cuba and Nicaragua, which is why protests there always end in much the same way. There are surprisingly frequent outbreaks of discontent in China, too. But they never get very large and they never last very long.

Iran is unusual among revolutionary regimes only in that really big and sustained protests are so frequent there. Prior to the latest outbreak, they also occurred in 2009–10 (the Green movement against electoral fraud), 2017–18 (protests over the cost of living), 2019 (protests over high gasoline prices), 2021 (over water shortages in Khuzestan), 2022 (triggered by the murder of Mahsa Amini for not wearing a headscarf), and 2023 (strikes over wages and working conditions). In each case, the regime used or threatened to use lethal force, and successfully suppressed the demonstrations.

Four questions need to be asked by anyone hoping for a counterrevolution to succeed:

1. Is there a leadership crisis or vacuum as the original leaders of the revolution die off?
2. Does the old regime have a credible candidate to restore?
3. Can foreign powers provide assistance without discrediting domestic opposition?
4. Can the forces of repression be divided or somehow outgunned?

I am not sure that in Iran today the answer is “yes” to any of those questions.

President Trump has threatened on several occasions to intervene if the Iranian regime “violently kills peaceful protesters.” On Tuesday he posted on Truth Social: “HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” The lesson of history is that foreign backing can certainly help. In 1820, a liberal revolution in Spain forced King Ferdinand VII to accept a constitution, effectively stripping him of absolute power. Then the “Holy Alliance” of European powers authorized France to intervene, and [Louis XVIII sent](https://thediplomatinspain.com/en/2023/04/07/200th-anniversary-of-the-entry-of-the-hundred-thousand-sons-of-st-louis-into-spain/) 100,000 French troops across the Pyrenees and restored Ferdinand’s authority. In 1848, the Austrian emperor begged Czar Nicholas I for help against the revolution in Hungary. Russia sent 200,000 troops. That was the end of the revolution.

Similarly, it is hard to believe that General Franco’s fascist forces would have succeeded in snuffing out the Spanish Republic without substantial military assistance from the German Condor Legion and the Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie. And, of course, the United States repeatedly intervened to overturn or to prevent communist takeovers during the Cold War. (For a comprehensive survey, I humbly recommend my 2024 book *[Colossus](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780143034797)*.)

Indeed, one could argue that the main reason the Iranian regime currently faces such difficulties *is* outside military and economic pressure. October 7, 2023, has proved to be a day of disaster for the Iranian regime and its strategy of fighting Israel on multiple fronts via proxies. The savagery of the attack on Israel by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad—just two of many terrorist organizations that Iran supports—provided the basis for drastic Israeli countermeasures with U.S. support. As a result, not only has Hamas been decimated; so, too, has Hezbollah. With the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria in December 2024, Iran lost a vital regional ally. Above all, Iran’s attempted air strikes against Israel opened the path for Israel to strike back far more effectively at Iran. This culminated last year in the 12-day war, which exposed the weakness of Iranian air defenses, and the U.S. B-2 bombing operation against the [Fordow nuclear facility](https://www.thefp.com/p/after-the-bombs-what-remains-of-irans) on June 22.

It is for this reason that so many commentators are urging President Trump to take further military action against Iran, in the belief that air strikes could help the protesters with their counterrevolution.

Yet foreign intervention can also backfire. In 1792, Austria and Prussia invaded France to rescue Louis XVI from his revolutionary captors. The Prussian commander, the Duke of Brunswick, [issued a manifesto](https://alphahistory.com/frenchrevolution/brunswick-manifesto-1792/) threatening to raze Paris to the ground if the king was harmed. The blowback was disastrous. The revolutionary crowd stormed the Tuileries Palace and the mobilization of a revolutionary army to defend France injected nationalism into the bloodstream of the new republic.

It was rather similar in 1918–1920, when Britain, France, Japan, and the United States [sent troops to Russia](https://warhistory.org/@msw/article/allied-intervention-in-the-russian-civil-war-i) to assist the Whites against the Bolsheviks. This enabled Lenin and Leon Trotsky to denounce their opponents as “foreign hirelings” and “imperialist lackeys.” For similar reasons, a significant number of U.S. Cold War interventions failed, notably in Cuba, Angola, and Nicaragua.

Conversely, the role of U.S. economic pressure [in overthrowing Salvador Allende](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/allende) in Chile has been greatly exaggerated. The key moment a counterrevolution succeeds—as the case of Chile illustrates—is when a significant portion of a country’s military and security forces elites decide that they would be better off getting rid of the revolutionaries and installing some version of the old regime. This was the case in Romania in 1989-1990, for example, when the overthrow of Nicolae Ceauşescu had the appearance of a popular uprising, but owed much to defection of members of his own government.

In Iran today, you would need a significant portion of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) to see better opportunities for profit from a post-Islamic regime than from the status quo. And we do not seem to be there yet.

At some point after Supreme Leader Khamenei dies—as the haggard old murderer eventually must—I expect we shall see Iran take a Bonapartist turn. From the ranks of the IRGC, there will emerge the successor to General Qasem Soleimani, who might have played the Napoleonic role if the United States had not killed him in 2020.

I passionately wish it could be otherwise. The images of the slaughter in Iran—of the corpses in body bags strewn contemptuously on the ground—are agonizing to contemplate. For the people of Iran, I have little doubt, it would be far preferable if the genial Mr. Pahlavi could resume his father’s [Peacock Throne](https://www.thoughtco.com/indias-peacock-throne-3971939) with the support of the United States and its allies. If President Trump can do anything at all to impede, if not destroy, the Islamic Republic’s massacre machine, I wish Godspeed to those who receive the orders to strike.

But happy restorations are very rare in history. Repression is so much more common—and so effective—that it rarely makes the front page. Perhaps that is why the young people who took the streets and campuses so regularly and noisily on behalf of the people of Gaza in the past two years are so conspicuously silent today.

Or perhaps there is another reason for that.
