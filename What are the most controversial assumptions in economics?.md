This question previously had details. They are now in a comment.

Probably this bad boy: a demand curve. This is the idea that higher prices mean less sales, and lower means more. I have not found this to be true at all — or at the very least, it’s a very controversial assumption. Recently, one Mr. Gregory Doucette made a video about yours truly, in response to a video that I made comparing his 200 dollar ebook to my 8 dollar one. I bought his book, and went over both of them, side by side, trying to be as objective as possible — and most people agreed that I actually was. After Greg made his video in response, I noticed something very curious in the comments — many people simply assumed that my product was worse, because it was far cheaper! Basically, where that curve breaks down from a traditional model is at the low priced end. For an ebook, almost no one is on the fence between ~5 and ~15 dollars, especially because most of my traffic comes from social media so people are fans, and the reviews are all extremely positive. If they will buy at 5, they will almost certainly buy at 10, and they will probably buy at 15, too. It’s 3x the price, going along that curve, BUT it’s basically flat. This is amplified by the people who enjoy a “luxury effect”. They like paying more, and scoff at an 8 dollar ebook — many people assumed the product was crap, due to the low price. So it’s entirely possible that people buy a product at a higher price, rather than less. This means that the demand curve actually bends back upon itself, a contortion that makes many economists wince reflexively. Sometimes humans are not logical, and a cost is not a cost.

I’d say this is only true for things where you can’t immediately tell the quality just by looking at it. For example, with a car, I can look under the hood, see how many miles it has on it, when it was made etc, to judge what the quality is. But with a book, the only ways to judge quality are via pric…

Yea I’d agree with that assumption. Won’t really get this in a grocery store, probably.

Jakub Judas

I’ve actually noticed this effect in myself even while grocery shopping. I have caught myself not checking the ingredients of a product and just assuming that the higher priced item is better quality.[Pascal Morimacil](https://www.quora.com/profile/Pascal-Morimacil)

Pretty much all the fundamental assumptions in economics are entirely incorrect, which is why the conclusions drawn from these declarations are always so wildly off.[Gaab Thobo](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gaab-Thobo)

Especially when they plot price vs quantity and totally ignore “quality” or “durability” of products as the economies of the scale are applied. Economists seem to dwell in the wold of idealism where the manufacturer is an “angel” and the most “pious” entity which would never ever temper with the “qu…

All social sciences (psychology, sociology, political science, economics) are pseudosciences, humans are too diverse and complex to be accurately measured and replicated in the ways those subjects intend.

Mainstream economists are specially pretentious.

Gaab Thobo

Absolutely, Pseudo-scientists/Economists treat human societies and human beings as if they are electrons of Physics without any emotions, feelings, individual liking and disliking.

No economist will tell you that it is a general law, in fact it is a law that works like that only for normal goods.

Fitness related products and services are sadly still luxury goods, and behave as such.[Geoffrey Verity Schofield](https://www.quora.com/profile/Geoffrey-Verity-Schofield)

Question nor answer used the word law.

Alessandro Olivo

The demand curve is (or better, represents) a law, the law of demand, whether you explicitly acknowledge the concept or not:)

Any good economist has heard of Veblen goods. This is not strange.[Geoffrey Verity Schofield](https://www.quora.com/profile/Geoffrey-Verity-Schofield)

Yes, though slightly different in this case. Veblen goods describe increasing the price causing an increase in demand. Whereas this is more about decreasing the price causing a decrease in demand.[Matthew Gordon](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Gordon-7)

Veblen goods are well established in the literature: [Veblen good - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good "en.m.wikipedia.org")

Their existence does not contradict human rationality. They may be an example of signaling.[Geoffrey Verity Schofield](https://www.quora.com/profile/Geoffrey-Verity-Schofield)
