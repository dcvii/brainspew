### Human nature has certain stubborn bugs that probably aren’t going anywhere

As I’ve noted in this newsletter, sometimes to the point of repetitiveness, I’ve lost a lot of faith in progressive institutions over the last decade or so. Many of the key moments involved viral videos. Some controversial incident would occur and generate intense reactions on all sides, more video would come out that (in my view) greatly clarified what really happened, and the response would be... basically ignoring what the video showed. People would just dig in further.

The case of the Covington Catholic High School kids from 2019 was one example. If you actually watched all the available videos closely, it demolished the narrative that the kids had harassed (or *racistly* harassed, as it was usually framed) the Native American activist Nathan Phillips. There was just no *there* there. The kids were already hyped up and chanting and dancing, and then Phillips walked over while doing his own chant and pounding his drum, and the kids... kept chanting and dancing, now to the beat of the drum. I was convinced that any decent, good-faith journalist would be able to see that the video debunked the initial claims that the kids had wronged Phillips somehow.

Was I an idiot! While there were some apologies and backtracking, ardent too-online progressives just [doubled and tripled and quadrupled down](https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/why-the-covington-story-still-grinds). They *couldn’t let go* of their belief that the white kids from Kentucky had engaged in a horrific act of racist abuse. They engaged in this weird pseudophrenological act in which they judged the angles of then–16-year-old Nick Sandmann’s smile in one clip of video and [determined, based on those angles, that he was a monster](https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/you-cant-tell-someones-evil-just). “ [I Saw the Smirk With My Eyes, But Felt It in My Gut](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a25966711/nick-sandmann-smirk/),” went the headline of an *Esquire* article that I swear actually and truly exists. The whole thing was like watching some sort of cult initiation rite.

Far more serious was the case of Kyle Rittenhouse, which I [wrote about on this newsletter](https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/here-are-my-contemporaneous-articles) and later [discussed at significant length on](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/honestly-with-bari-weiss/id1570872415) *[Honestly](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/honestly-with-bari-weiss/id1570872415)*. I’ll just borrow from myself rather than rehash what I said back in 2021:

> It seemed pretty clear, simply from watching the videos and reading the relevant laws and legal analysis, that Rittenhouse at the very least had a *decent* self-defense case. Not ironclad, but decent. And yet I watched many influential media figures and politicians engage in this weird snowballing act of collective [truthiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness) — they turned Rittenhouse into a monster, into someone who had committed *obviously* premeditated acts of murder, in a manner that ran dozens of laps ahead of the available evidence.

Again, though, the video did not lead to a bunch of people who had initial and different knee-jerk reactions to news of the shootings converging on a shared reality. Again, there was quadrupling down on the belief that Rittenhouse had been the antagonist and had clearly committed *some* crime, though opinions on the specifics differed.

In neither case did the available videos definitively answer every question, but they did definitively answer some of the most important ones: The videos of the incident on the Washington Mall definitively failed to turn up any evidence of actual harassment of Phillips, and the videos of Rittenhouse definitively showed that all three of the people he shot (two fatally) were pursuing him, and that he himself had not been the aggressor at any point. That, combined with simply looking up the relevant firearm and self-defense statutes, made it clear that he probably had not actually done anything illegal, and that honest reporting and commentary on the shootings needed to at least nod to that reality.

I’ve been thinking a lot about those two incidents in the wake of Alex Pretti’s killing by ICE agents, because we’re seeing a right-wing version of the same disturbing dynamics—arguably, a more intense version.

Some quick throat-clear: In a lot of instances video *doesn’t* resolve disagreement. I’m not claiming it’s a panacea. So this post isn’t about super-ambiguous cases. Also, I’m obviously not directly equating incidents involving public shaming with incidents involving violence and death; my argument is just that the tribal or partisan brain operates in generally similar ways regardless of whether the brain in question is left or right or something else.

While the scene of the Pretti killing was chaotic and certain details of certain moments are obscured from view, there is not one iota of a trace of evidence, anywhere, that Pretti did anything that warranted lethal force on the part of the ICE officers who had wrestled him to the ground, beat him, and pepper-sprayed him by the time they shot him. *The* *New York Times*, as is often the case with these sorts of heavily scrutinized incidents, [has done the best video analysis I’m aware of](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000010668660/new-video-analysis-reveals-flawed-and-fatal-decisions-in-shooting-of-pretti.html).

On right-wing social media, though, you would think that we didn’t know all this, that much of these videos simply don’t exist. It is very, very hard to even understand the arguments many Trump supporters are making because the videos do provide so much information and prove so demonstrably that Pretti posed no threat to them at the moment they shot him.

It’s been interesting to notice all the similarities between how these folks justify adopting such a reality-denying position and how lefties have in similar, prior circumstances. One is to simply invoke tropes common to their movement that don’t quite map onto what happened, but which seem to activate certain feelings of anger and resentment. In the case of the Covington Catholic kids, for example, the situation superficially looked *similar enough* to an incident of white-on-nonwhite racial harassment that many commentators just sort of shrugged and went with that. Kyle Rittenhouse, meanwhile, was a “white vigilante” or a “white militiaman” with a gun — figures that loom very large and dangerous in the liberal/left imagination. This can partly explain why so many progressive commentators erred, over and over, in claiming that his victims had been black — the idea of a white vigilante or militiamen killing black people is the scariest version of this trope, and thus the memetically stickiest.

We have another trope here, a conservative one, in the case of Pretti: the armed anti-cop lunatic. So conservative commentators and the more deranged Xers keep mentioning that he was armed at the time of his death, echoing the misleading statements put out by top-level Trump officials right afterward. But, at the risk of repeating myself from earlier this week, not only did Pretti never threaten the cops with his gun, but all the available evidence suggests they didn’t even notice it until he was completely subdued.

The latest video of Pretti to come out, [which shows him](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/alex-pretti-kicking-ice-vehicle-video.html) spitting and cursing at ICE agents and kicking in a taillight of one of their videos 11 days before he was killed, has only “vindicated” the right-wing belief that the shooting was justified. Here we see the same sort of deeply tribalistic, pseudomagical thinking — albeit applied to a much more serious incident — that can cause someone to believe that they can infer heaps of useful information about a 16-year-old based on the angel of his smile. The fact that Pretti engaged in an earlier, destructive incident somehow tells us, contrary to all the available evidence of the shooting itself, that the shooting was justified.

After I noted on X that the video did not really change anything about the shooter itself, the antiwoke psychologist J.D. Haltigan [complained](https://x.com/JDHaltigan/status/2016727616976273464), “Are you truly this ridiculous? Do you understand probability? His negative emotionality and petulance was an intrinsic behavioral feature. Not a bug. It is what set in train his own demise in the 2nd incident.”

I don’t really understand how a guy with a PhD in psychology can claim to be able to infer from one video that someone has “intrinsic” negative emotionality and petulance, but let’s set that aside: Let’s hereby diagnose Alex Pretti as having “intrinsic negative emotionality and petulance.” Let’s also assume he was exhibiting those same (intrinsic) traits on the day he was shot in the back by ICE agents while lying prone and unarmed. You know what still happened? He was shot and killed by ICE agents to whom he posed no threat, who had severely outnumbered and subdued him.

Haltigan also [responded to a tweet by Ryan Grim](https://x.com/JDHaltigan/status/2016974062195560878) by saying, “The only fact that matters is that Pretti was defined by his petulance and negative emotionality. He alone set in train the causal sequence of events that led to his demise you absolute stupid hack. ‘He was a human.’ Lmfao.”

“The only fact that matters” and “He alone” are subtly revealing. This reminded me of Laura Wagner’s [remarkable](https://archive.is/p1zsy#selection-1865.588-1865.713) *[Deadspin](https://archive.is/p1zsy#selection-1865.588-1865.713)* [article about the Covington Catholic incident](https://archive.is/p1zsy#selection-1865.588-1865.713), published after more video had come out and had caused some people to rethink their stances. She was a true dead-ender who insisted (and likely would insist to this day) that the kids on the mall had done something horrible, and that only centrist media–consuming rubes considered the incident “debunked.”

She and Haltigan, despite occupying opposite ends of the political spectrum, are actually trying to pull very similar acts. Haltigan is saying *Don’t look at all the videos we have of the moment of Alex Pretti’s death — look at what he did beforehand, and focus entirely on his own decisions and personality traits rather than on the actions of the ICE officers who killed him.* Wagner is saying *Don’t look closely at the extensive videos that show the entire lead-up to and context of the event — instead, focus on the look on the* “shithead MAGA teens’” *faces, which readily demonstrate* “the smugness of a group secure in its relative power over someone more vulnerable than they are.” Haltigan thinks he can get to the real truth of the matter by examining Pretti’s behavior during an entirely different incident; Wagner thinks if you look deep into the MAGA teens’ eyes, *that’s* where the truth lies. Or maybe the truth, in Pretti’s case, lies in Joe Biden’s immigration policies, as [Megyn Kelly has asserted](https://x.com/MegynKellyShow/status/2016697446068326563). What matters most is not *exactly* what happened, revealed rather clearly by the videos, but the sorts of symbols being evoked by the *types* of events and the *types* of characters inhabiting these incidents.

\*\*\*

I don’t want to discount the fact that a lot of recorded incidents remain fundamentally ambiguous. Video was never going to be a panacea.

But it’s been disappointing to see how little it helps even in incidents where it *does* seem to clear up factual questions. On the other hand, maybe it was naive to ever think otherwise. We are not, fundamentally, a reality-based species. We do not live in an objective external world; we live in our brains, and our brains engage in all sorts of unconscious mediation and processing and biasing. It is very, very hard to run counter to your herd. It feels *dangerous*. That’s truest with genuine life-and-death incidents like the Kenosha or Minneapolis shootings, yes, but even less serious ones like the incident on the mall can *feel* almost life and death because they tap into our deepest and most dearly held beliefs.

I’m not immune to these forces at all. I chimed in on the Covington Catholic case long after I felt queasy about what was being said online simply out of fear. And there are certain hotly discussed subjects I only briefly touch on because of my own affiliations and communities and so on — it just doesn’t feel worth it. So I’m not trying to claim I’m above it all. I also think there are always going to be online lunatics who sign on for endless validation that they are right and their political enemies are evil.

But if even a relatively small number of people showed a willingness to go against their tribes not on the grand ideological questions that divide us, but on the *specific* facts about *specific* incidents, that would go a long way, even if only symbolically. It’s just much easier said than done.
