***If you were to name the defining figures of the 21st-century conservative movement, Dennis Prager would surely rank near the top of the list. A longtime radio host and founder of digital educational platform [PragerU](https://www.prageru.com/), he is one of the world’s best-known public intellectuals, publishing more than a dozen books on religion, morality, and the foundations of Western civilization.***

***His latest book, “ [If There Is No God](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780063351301): The Battle Over Who Defines Good and Evil,” hits shelves next week. Drawn from a weekend-long lecture Prager delivered to 74 teenagers in 1992, it is a full-throated defense of objective, biblical morality at a time, he says, when more people dispute its existence than ever before. Though rooted in an earlier moment, the book holds new weight: In 2024, Prager suffered a catastrophic fall that paralyzed him from the waist down.***

***“A certain percentage of this book,” he reveals in the introduction, “was written by dictation and editing from my hospital bed. Were it not for Joel Alperson, who also organized and recorded the entire weekend, the book would not have been finished. We completed the book together. It is a testament to how important we both consider this work.”***

***Next week, our Abigail Shrier will interview Prager from his hospital room, so stay tuned for their full conversation. And below, we bring you an exclusive excerpt from his book, answering a question that many of us ask every day: In a world where profoundly evil things happen, how do we raise good people? —The Editors***

Ever since I was very young, I have been preoccupied with one issue: Why do people hurt other people? Why do people do evil?

I was born in 1948, only three years after the Holocaust. I’m a third-generation American. Yet, when I was a kid, from the earliest time I could think, the Holocaust consumed me. When I was about 10, I watched a program on television, and I saw an image of Adolf Hitler. I asked my father, “Who is that man?” He said, “He was Hitler, and he killed six million Jews.”

Now, most kids would think, *Whoa, that’s bad*, and then go on with their day. I thought, *Whoa, that’s bad*, but did not go on with my day and haven’t ever since, even though I lost no relatives in the Holocaust. The Holocaust is so horrible that you don’t have to be Jewish to wonder, *How did the most civilized country in the world orchestrate such a horror?* Or to put it philosophically, *How did the country that gave us Beethoven, Bach, Schiller, Thomas Mann, and other unique figures in the sciences and arts also give us Auschwitz?*

Because Americans have been spared much of the suffering the world has known, we have grown up somewhat naive about humanity. The typical American’s response to inhumanity is, “They’re ‘sick.’ ” But how can that be? Did a massive number of Germans all of a sudden become psychologically ill? Were all the sadists who worked in the concentration camps sick? Were all the Germans who watched their longtime neighbors being rounded up and sent away sick?

How do horrible things happen? Why do we have to lock the doors to our house every night? Why do we need car alarms? Why are most women afraid of walking alone in virtually any of America’s big cities at night? Why do people do so many bad things?

And, given how much cruelty human beings have engaged in—human sacrifice, slavery, mass murder, torture, rape, child abuse—how do we make good people?

One of my biggest worries in life is that people these days are animated more by feelings than by values.

Let me explain what I mean. Imagine you are walking along a body of water—a river, lake, or ocean—with your dog, when suddenly you notice your dog has fallen into the water and appears to be drowning. About 100 feet away, you notice a stranger, a person you don’t know, is also drowning. Assuming your dog can’t swim, and also assuming that you would like to save both your dog and the stranger, the question is: Who would you try to save first?

If your inclination is to save your dog, that means you were animated by feelings. Your feelings are understandable, and as I own two dogs, I fully relate. You love your dog more than the stranger, and I do, too.

But the whole point of values is to hold that something is more important than your feelings. There is no ambivalence in the Bible about this. “Thou shalt not murder” is not for one group alone. “Thou shalt not steal” is not for one group alone. It is for every human being. Human beings are created in God’s image. Therefore, human life is sacred and animal life is not. You should save the stranger.

Unfortunately, those universal values are not what we’re teaching people today. I was recently in Cleveland doing a television show. The audience was composed of students from six different Cleveland high schools. And the students were of different races, ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and religions. I asked them a question: “If you really wanted a certain item, would you shoplift if you were sure you could get away with it?”

Nearly all those kids said yes. And even the handful who would not shoplift were not prepared to say the others were wrong. Why? Because, they said, everything is a matter of opinion.

The great moral tragedy of our time is that feelings have replaced values. And they shouldn’t. Feelings are beautiful. Feelings are wonderful. It’s good to cry, it’s good to laugh, it’s good to love, it’s good to care, it’s good to have compassion. Feelings are what make us human. But values must always come first.

Hitler felt that Jews should be destroyed. Whites in South Africa felt that apartheid was right, that blacks shouldn’t be allowed to use white bathrooms or white restaurants or go to white businesses or live in white neighborhoods. Feelings cannot determine what is right.

In fact, the Bible repeatedly warns people not to rely on their hearts. If you want to know why so many people reject Bible-based religions, there it is: Most people want to be governed by their feelings and not have anyone—be it God or a book—tell them otherwise.

The battle in America and the rest of the Western world today is between the Bible and the heart.

Millions of people today are atheist or agnostic. If you are one of them, my goal is not to convince you that God exists. But I *am* asking you to live *as if* you believe God exists, and by extension, as if you believe objective good and evil exist.

Why? Because for a good society to maintain itself, we need objective morality. What would happen to math if it were reduced to feeling? There would be no math. Likewise, if we reduce morality to feeling, there would be no morality. In other words, if values and feelings are identical, there would be no such thing as a value.

Imagine a child in kindergarten who sees a box of cookies meant for the whole class and takes them all for himself. Most people would acknowledge that the child has to be taught that this is wrong. But if values were derived from feelings, this child would keep all the cookies on the basis of his personal value that whoever gets to the cookies first gets to keep them. It’s not as though this philosophy is without precedent. It has been the way many of the world’s societies have looked at life: “Might makes right.”

Values measure your actions against an ultimate authority. Feelings measure your actions against nothing at all.

That’s precisely why the Ten Commandments outlaw stealing. Because stealing is *normal*. The whole purpose of moral and legal codes is to forbid people from acting on their natural feelings.

Consider another example, this one far more serious. In virtually every past society, a vast number of women and girls have been raped. In wartime, when victorious armies could essentially do what they wanted, rape was the norm, with few exceptions, such as the American, British, and Israeli armies. Only men whose behavior is guided by values rather than feelings do not rape in such circumstances.

Both of these vastly different examples prove the same thing: To lead good lives, people must first learn Bible-based values, mandated when they are children. Over time, that instruction generates moral values, which then produce moral feelings. But we cannot rely on feelings first to determine how we act. When we do, the world descends into chaos, and people tear each other apart. Values measure your actions against an ultimate authority. Feelings measure your actions against nothing at all.

And so the answer to these questions—why are there so many problems? Why are people behaving so badly?—is clear. Fewer and fewer people are telling their children two of the most powerful words in our language: “That’s wrong.”

When my son was 3, he was pushed down by a 5-year-old in a park, and his head hit the concrete. My son was fine, but it was an ugly scene. Then the 5-year-old kid’s mother went over to her son, hugged him, and said, “What’s bothering you, darling?”

In that moment, the mother essentially said to her son: “Your feelings are more important than right and wrong.”

People in the West have been trying to teach values without reference to God and the Bible since the late 18th century, and in America since World War II. This has been a moral and intellectual failure. The most secular institutions, the universities, have produced the worst ideas: multiculturalism, moral relativism, opposition to capitalism, virulent anti-Americanism... the list goes on.

Ethics cut off from their biblical roots are like flowers cut off from their roots in the soil. Someone could look at the flowers and say, “These flowers look great. Apparently, they can survive when cut from their soil.” That is how people look at Bible-based or Judeo-Christian ethics cut from their religious soil. They appear to survive for a few generations. But like flowers, they will eventually wither and die.

So, yes, you can teach people good values without faith. And I wish we would—that is certainly better than teaching bad values or no values. But without God and the Bible, they won’t last. Goodness without God isn’t as strong as goodness with God.

Again, you don’t need to believe in God. But deciding between right and wrong is essentially impossible without a value system revealed by God. If there isn’t a God who says pushing little kids down—or raping women—is wrong, then all we have to go by are feelings, and then doing whatever you feel like doing *isn’t wrong at all.*

We’re not talking about theory. We’re living in a country where every few minutes a woman is raped, every minute a car is stolen, and every few hours a human being is murdered. The people committing these crimes don’t act on the basis of biblical values; they act on the basis of feelings.

This is not a wholesale indictment of feelings. Feelings are what most distinguish humans from robots. Feelings make us feel alive. Without feelings, life wouldn’t be worth living. But feelings alone are morally unreliable. Guided by feelings, every type of behavior is justifiable: If you feel like shoplifting and act on your feelings, you’ll shoplift. If a man is sexually aroused by a woman, he will rape her. And, of course, if you have deeper feelings for your pet than for a stranger, you’ll save your dog and let the stranger drown.

If we rely solely on feelings, everything is justifiable. And a society that justifies everything stands for nothing.
