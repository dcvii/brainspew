As a retired Green Beret (CW4) with years in the trenches of unconventional warfare and counterinsurgency, I've seen firsthand how insurgencies rise, thrive, and sometimes topple governments. My goal here isn't to glorify conflict. It's to pull back the curtain on these dynamics so everyday Americans can spot them in real time. This is part of my ongoing series to "train myself out of a job" by empowering you to see the ground truth the way I do. We'll break down key concepts from U.S. military doctrine like TC 18-01 (Special Forces Unconventional Warfare) and JP 3-24 (Counterinsurgency), translating them into plain English. In upcoming articles, we'll apply these lessons to evaluate the leftist/Democrat/progressive movement and party, because understanding insurgency isn't just history. It's a tool for safeguarding our Republic.

Think of this as Insurgency 101: What makes a rebellion tick? Why do some succeed while others fizzle? And how can recognizing these patterns help us as civilians protect our way of life?

## What is an Insurgency? Breaking It Down for the Layman

At its core, an insurgency is a protracted politico-military struggle aimed at weakening or overthrowing a government or occupying power. It's not just random violence. It's a calculated effort to erode authority through a mix of guerrilla tactics, subversion, and winning hearts and minds. From TC 18-01, unconventional warfare (UW) supports this by enabling resistance movements to coerce, disrupt, or topple regimes using underground networks, auxiliaries, and guerrillas in denied areas.

JP 3-24 flips the script a bit, focusing on counterinsurgency (COIN), but it lays out insurgency as a "comprehensive civilian and military effort" to defeat the established order while addressing root causes like grievances. Insurgents aren't always the bad guys in doctrine. They're actors exploiting weaknesses. For civilians, picture it like this: It's a virus attacking a body politic, spreading through dissatisfaction, ideology, and smart organization. Success depends on turning passive discontent into active support, much like how a viral social media campaign can snowball from a few complaints into a massive boycott or protest movement.

Key takeaway: Insurgencies thrive in fragile states where governance fails, grievances fester, and external influences stir the pot. Sound familiar in today's polarized world? Think about how economic hardships or cultural divides in your own community could breed similar unrest if left unchecked.

## The Eight Dynamics of Success: What Makes an Insurgency Win

Both TC 18-01 and JP 3-24 outline eight key dynamics that turn a ragtag group into a formidable force. These aren't just military buzzwords. They're the recipe for transforming gripes into revolution. I've seen them play out overseas, and they're eerily applicable to domestic movements today. To make this relatable, I'll tie each one to real-world scenarios you might see in news headlines or local politics, showing how these principles drive change (or chaos) in everyday life. For each dynamic, we'll cover a general description, what success looks like, and what failure looks like, so you can spot the difference on the ground.

Before we dive in, I want you to do a mental exercise as you read through these dynamics. Apply them to the leftist/Democrat/progressive movement or party right here in America. Grade them on a scale, say, 1 to 10, where they stand on each one. Ask yourself: Are they being successful or unsuccessful in this area? Which dynamics are their strengths, giving them momentum, and which are weaknesses holding them back? Think critically about what you've observed in politics, media, and on the streets. This isn't about bias; it's about seeing the patterns clearly to better defend our freedoms.

1\. Leadership: The Glue That Holds It Together

General Description

Strong, charismatic leaders provide vision, coordination, and inspiration. They rally support by promising change and distributing power fairly. JP 3-24 emphasizes leaders who exploit grievances to build legitimacy, often portraying themselves as saviors against a corrupt system. Think of figures like union bosses or viral influencers who unite people around a cause, whether it's fighting for workers' rights or mobilizing online campaigns.

Successful Leadership

When leadership nails it, you see a unified front with clear direction and motivated followers. Leaders delegate effectively, adapt to setbacks, and inspire loyalty through personal example. In real life, it's like a CEO turning a failing company around by empowering teams and communicating a compelling vision, resulting in growth, high morale, and sustained momentum. Insurgencies with this thrive because everyone knows their role and buys into the big picture.

Unsuccessful Leadership

Poor leadership leads to infighting, confusion, and desertions. Leaders might be ego-driven, micromanage, or fail to adapt, causing fragmentation. Picture a dysfunctional sports team with a coach who plays favorites or ignores player input. Losses pile up, stars quit, and the whole effort collapses. In insurgencies, this means lost battles, eroded support, and eventual dissolution as trust evaporates.

2\. Ideology: The Fuel for the Fire

General Description

This is the "why" that unites people. A compelling ideology, be it religious, nationalist, or revolutionary, justifies actions and motivates recruits. It must resonate culturally and address real pains like inequality or oppression. TC 18-01 notes ideology helps gain popular support; JP 3-24 adds the "narrative" angle, a story framing the insurgency as heroes fighting villains. Relate it to modern slogans like "Make America Great Again" or "Black Lives Matter." These aren't just words; they're stories that tap into deep frustrations.

Successful Ideology

Success means an ideology that deeply resonates, adapts to cultural contexts, and provides a clear moral high ground. It turns passive sympathizers into active participants by addressing grievances head-on and offering hope. Like a blockbuster movie franchise that builds a massive fanbase through relatable themes and emotional hooks, people evangelize it, defend it fiercely, and it spreads virally, sustaining the movement through tough times.

Unsuccessful Ideology

When ideology flops, it's vague, outdated, or alienates potential supporters. It fails to connect emotionally or justify sacrifices, leading to apathy or backlash. Imagine a marketing campaign that misses the mark, offensive slogans or irrelevant messages cause boycotts and ridicule. In insurgencies, this results in recruitment droughts, internal doubts, and easy counter-narratives from opponents that dismantle the cause.

3\. Objectives: Clear Goals at Every Level

General Description

Insurgents set strategic (overthrow the regime), operational (control regions), and tactical (disrupt supply lines) goals. Success comes from aligning these with reality, starting small and scaling up. In civilian life, it's like a startup's business plan: Big vision (dominate the market), mid-term steps (expand to new cities), and daily tasks (launch a product). Movements without clear, achievable milestones fizzle out.

Successful Objectives

Effective objectives are realistic, measurable, and cascaded down levels, building incremental wins that boost confidence. It's like climbing a mountain with marked trails and checkpoints. Each step forward motivates the team, adjusts for obstacles, and leads to the summit. Insurgencies succeed here by celebrating small victories, like seizing a town, which snowballs into broader control and legitimacy.

Unsuccessful Objectives

Vague or overly ambitious goals cause confusion, wasted resources, and frustration. Without alignment, efforts scatter like a project team chasing shiny objects. No progress, burnout, and failure. In insurgencies, this looks like unattainable promises leading to demoralization, defections, and easy pickings for counterforces who exploit the disarray.

4\. Environment and Geography: Playing the Home Field Advantage

General Description

Favorable terrain like mountains, jungles, or urban mazes provides cover. Rural areas allow large guerrilla ops; cities favor clandestine networks. Insurgents use this to their edge, blending in and striking from safety. Urban environments amplify propaganda through media and crowds. Think about how protests in dense cities like New York spread faster via social media, versus rural areas where isolation helps hide operations.

Successful Environment and Geography

Success involves leveraging terrain for protection, mobility, and surprise, turning weaknesses into strengths. Like a home team using familiar stadium quirks to outplay visitors, insurgents control access, ambush effectively, and use local knowledge to evade capture, prolonging the fight and wearing down enemies.

Unsuccessful Environment and Geography

Ignoring or misusing terrain exposes vulnerabilities. Flat lands invite easy assaults, or urban ops without cover lead to quick arrests. It's like playing soccer on ice without skates: Slips, falls, and losses. Insurgencies fail here through predictable movements, lost hideouts, and rapid government crackdowns that isolate and destroy them.

5\. External Support: The Lifeline from Outside

General Description

No insurgency succeeds in isolation. Moral, political, financial, or military aid from abroad (or sympathetic groups) is crucial. TC 18-01 warns of dependency risks; JP 3-24 highlights how external backers provide sanctuary, training, or resources. Relatable example: Crowdfunding campaigns or international alliances backing local causes, like global donations to disaster relief.

Successful External Support

Balanced aid enhances capabilities without over-reliance, providing weapons, intel, or diplomatic cover that tips scales. Like a startup securing venture capital to scale smartly, it accelerates growth, offers expertise, and sustains ops during lean times, leading to strategic advantages and eventual victory.

Unsuccessful External Support

Insufficient or strings-attached support starves resources, or dependency creates puppets vulnerable to cutoff. Picture a band relying on one shady promoter. When he bails, tours cancel and the group disbands. Insurgencies crumble here from supply shortages, betrayed alliances, or exploitation by backers with their own agendas.

6\. Internal Support: The Homegrown Backbone

General Description

This is the grassroots fuel, popular backing from within the population. It's about winning hearts and minds through services, protection, or coercion. JP 3-24 stresses that without internal support, insurgents can't sustain ops; they need locals for recruits, intel, and hiding spots. In real life, it's like community leaders gaining trust by fixing local issues, turning neighbors into loyal supporters.

Successful Internal Support

Deep-rooted backing provides endless recruits, safe havens, and intel, creating a self-sustaining loop. Like a beloved local business thriving on word-of-mouth and loyalty programs, it builds resilience. Locals protect the cause, share resources, and amplify messages, making the insurgency nearly impossible to uproot.

Unsuccessful Internal Support

Lacking buy-in leads to isolation, betrayals, and resource droughts. If locals fear or resent the group, they tip off authorities. Imagine a restaurant ignoring customer complaints. Bad reviews tank it. Insurgencies fail with apathy or hostility, facing constant leaks, recruitment failures, and eventual encirclement by unsympathetic populations.

7\. Phasing and Timing: The Art of Patient Buildup

General Description

Insurgencies evolve in phases, not overnight. JP 3-24 describes three broad stages: Latent/Incipient (building infrastructure and subversion), Guerrilla Warfare (attacks to erode control), and War of Movement (open conflict to collapse the government). Relate this to building a career: Start with planning, test ideas, then go all-in.

Successful Phasing and Timing

Masterful progression builds strength gradually, striking when the enemy is weak. Like a boxer pacing rounds to wear down an opponent before a knockout, it avoids early exposure, accumulates wins, and escalates at opportune moments, leading to overwhelming momentum and collapse of the regime.

Unsuccessful Phasing and Timing

Rushed or mistimed phases expose weaknesses prematurely, leading to defeats. Jumping to open war without buildup is like launching a product without testing. Bugs everywhere, backlash, and flop. Insurgencies stall or die from overextension, missed opportunities, or counterstrikes that nip growth in the bud.

8\. Organization and Operational Patterns: Flexible and Compartmentalized

General Description

Cellular structures limit damage from captures. Focus on local levels for grassroots support, with echelons handling political, military, and logistics. Adaptability is vital. Rigid groups get crushed. Think of it like a franchise: Independent cells operate locally but follow a central model, evolving based on needs.

Successful Organization and Operational Patterns

Flexible, decentralized setups allow quick adaptation and resilience. Cells operate independently yet cohesively. Like a tech company with agile teams pivoting to market changes, it minimizes losses from compromises, innovates tactics, and scales efficiently, outmaneuvering slower opponents.

Unsuccessful Organization and Operational Patterns

Rigid hierarchies or poor compartmentalization cause cascading failures from one breach. It's like a chain store with top-down micromanagement. Slow decisions, bureaucracy, and collapse if HQ falls. Insurgencies suffer mass arrests, disrupted ops, and inability to evolve, leading to predictable defeats.

## Why This Matters for Civilians: Seeing the Signs Before It's Too Late

As a veteran, I've learned insurgencies don't announce themselves. They simmer until they boil over. By understanding these dynamics, you can spot patterns in media narratives, protests, or political movements that mirror them. Is there a compelling ideology rallying the disaffected? External or internal support propping it up? Phased escalation from subversion to open challenge? These aren't abstract; they're tools to analyze what's happening in your backyard, from school board fights to national elections.

In future pieces, we'll dissect how these apply to the progressive left's tactics, narratives of systemic oppression, organized auxiliaries in activism, and phased pushes for power. Knowledge is power; let's use it to defend our freedoms.

Stay vigilant, America. Question narratives, seek truth, and remember: The best counterinsurgency starts with an informed populace.
