### This isn’t just about a viral conservative fad

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VjFk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9281daa2-9fab-4c49-a377-83d5a8db00b8_1992x1505.jpeg)

Many institutions that used to be dominated by men are now at gender parity, or even majority-female. This is particularly true in academia. How will this change these institutions? More importantly, how will it change society?

The recent spate of discussion over “feminization” or “the great feminization” includes some actual research on this question and a lot of searingly hot takes. Let’s try to separate the wheat from the chaff.

The current surge of interest in this issue apparently started with a speech Helen Andrews gave at the National Conservatism Conference in September. She adapted it into an [essay in](https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-great-feminization/) *[Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-great-feminization/)* that spread far and wide — or far and wide enough, at least, that David French [wrote a critical response to it](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/opinion/helen-andrews-feminization-compact.html) for his *New York Times* newsletter. Andrews cited an article the social psychologists Cory Clark and Bo Winegard [wrote on this subject for](https://quillette.com/2022/10/08/sex-and-the-academy/) *[Quillette](https://quillette.com/2022/10/08/sex-and-the-academy/)* [in 2022](https://quillette.com/2022/10/08/sex-and-the-academy/). Clark has also published academic research on the question. [Richard Hanania is very skeptical](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/the-feminization-talking-point-as) and ties the shoddy reasoning (as he sees it) animating feminization claims to broader problems with anti-intellectualism on the right.

I won’t leave you in suspense: While I think it’s well and good to highlight sizable sex differences in attitudes and behavior and to speculate about what they might mean as institutions become more female, I find a lot of the theorizing going on here bizarre. In many cases, proponents of the “feminization” theory (theories, really) are making the exact same sorts of leaps of logic and wildly overconfident claims they’d usually accuse “woke” researchers of making.

But I want to put this controversy into context. Because part of what makes this an interesting story is that academia, on the whole, has not done a good job taking sex differences seriously. In certain ways, the present proponents of “feminization” theory simply reflect the pendulum swinging *back* and wildly overshooting a reasonable center point. So all of this is easier to understand if we zoom out to better understand the broader context

### Don’t You Dare Write Anything On That Slate!

In most corners of academia where those on the political left dominate — so in most corners of academia — the idea that biological factors could contribute to sex differences between men and women is seen as pseudoscientific, if not offensive.

The specifics vary from field to field. But in many areas, it’s considered a fact that biology couldn’t be responsible for these differences — rather, the differences arise solely due to external factors like cultural pressures, most notably discrimination against women.

To take just one example, regular readers of this newsletter might recall [the recent news coverage](https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/some-thoughts-on-mankeeping) over “mankeeping,” or the idea that women shoulder a disproportionate amount of the load for ensuring their male partners maintain decent social ties.

In the academic article that kicked off that discussion, [the authors claimed](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2025-35803-002), without citation, that “Difficulties with making or maintaining close bonds between men is **not attributable to biological gender differences** but instead to stringent ideological barriers that men face in the formation of nonromantic social ties,” emphasis mine. The lead author is a social psychologist and her co-author is a sociologist in training, and this view is fairly standard across many areas of academia. It’s actually a pretty radical theory, given what we know about the psychological effects of sex hormones; one could easily argue that the default assumption should be that biology *does* contribute to behavioral differences between men and women. And yet within certain academic bubbles, you don’t even really need to defend the blank slate view — everyone knows it’s true.

This has been a sore spot for some academics for a long time — and not just conservative ones. Steven Pinker has written about it a lot, most notably in his important 2005 book *[The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial-Nature/dp/0142003344)*, and other academics, like my friend Carole Hooven, have tried to [beat the drum](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Testosterone-Hormone-Dominates-Divides/dp/1250236061) that men and women are different, that those differences have at least partial biological roots, and that it’s okay to say so.

The false “consensus” criticized by Pinker, Hooven, and others has been enforced not through some sort of breakthrough showing that biological differences have no psychological impact (it’s hard to imagine what some sort of breakthrough would even look like), but through moral suasion and bullying. If you argue that biology can explain male-female differences, in short, you’re either a misogynist or a misogynist-in-training. You’re saying, or at least implying, that women are *inferior* to males, and after thousands of years of patriarchal rule that is only just now beginning to crack, the last thing we need is for these ideas to become scientifically respectable.

Of course none of these claims flow directly from the mere observation that it’s likely biological factors help contribute to sex differences, and yet that hasn’t stopped the blank slaters from, in some cases, exacting a heavy toll on those who make certain arguments about sex differences.

The Larry Summers “scandal” is a prime example. Helen Andrews [treats it as a uniquely important moment](https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-great-feminization/), arguing that “The entire ‘woke’ era could be extrapolated from that moment, from the details of how Summers was cancelled and, most of all, who did the cancelling: women.”

In my view, this is silly and characteristic of the overclaiming presently going on in her camp (more on which in Part 2), but the difference between what Summers said and what he was purported to have said reveals a pretty hostile intellectual climate.

In 2005, Summers, then the president of Harvard, gave a talk at a Cambridge National Bureau of Economics Research conference on “Diversifying the Science & Engineering Workforce.” You can and should read the full text of his speech [here](https://www.harvard.edu/president/news-speeches-summers/2005/remarks-at-nber-conference-on-diversifying-the-science-engineering-workforce/), but much of it concerned what appeared to be a leaky pipeline (he doesn’t use that exact phrase) for female academics. As he explained, great strides had been made in making graduate programs less male-dominated, but those gains didn’t seem to be translating to the top of the field, to prestigious, tenured professorships and so on. Something was happening between when women entered academia and when they should have been emerging as its leading lights.

Summers lays out three potential theories to explain what’s going on, in rough order from most to least important. He is careful and hedge-y throughout, making clear that he is merely theorizing based on his own observations and reading. The most important factor, he said, was that the track toward top-flight academic positions requires an insane amount of commitment on the part of academics who are in their twenties, not only in terms of time actually spent on the job, but in time *thinking* about their job while doing other stuff. We can perhaps better understand these disparities, said Summers, by asking:

> \[W\]hat fraction of young women in their mid-twenties make a decision that they don’t want to have a job that they think about eighty hours a week\[?\] What fraction of young men make a decision that they’re unwilling to have a job that they think about eighty hours a week, and to observe what the difference is\[?\] And that has got to be a large part of what is observed. Now that begs entirely the normative questions — which I’ll get to a little later — of, is our society right to expect that level of effort from people who hold the most prominent jobs? Is our society right to have familial arrangements in which women are asked to make that choice and asked more to make that choice than men? Is our society right to ask of anybody to have a prominent job at this level of intensity\[\]?

Summers name-checked the Harvard researchers Claudia Goldin and Larry Katz in his talk, and a lot of the work they’ve produced over the years has supported the idea that in certain fields, men get ahead because women take time off, or reduce their hours, after giving birth, usually in their twenties. I believe this to be an exceptionally important observation and one with all sorts of policy ramifications. “To buttress conviction and theory with anecdote, a young woman who worked very closely with me at the Treasury and who has subsequently gone on to work at Google highly successfully, is a 1994 graduate of Harvard Business School,” said Summers, concluding this part of his talk. “She reports that of her first year section, there were twenty-two women, of whom three are working full time at this point.”

So that was the first and most important factor Summers mentioned — one that is thoroughly uncontroversial in left-of-center circles, and that happens to fit neatly into long-standing feminist theories about the disproportionate burden of child-rearing that falls on women.

It was Summers’ proposed second-most important factor driving gender disparities in academia that would eventually lead to his resignation: the greater male-variability hypothesis.

Here Summers made clear he’s referencing why “the representation \[of women is\] even lower and more problematic in science and engineering than it is in other fields,” and he explains:

> It does appear that on many, many different human attributes — height, weight, propensity for criminality, overall IQ, mathematical ability, scientific ability — there is relatively clear evidence that whatever the difference in means — which can be debated — there is a difference in the standard deviation, and variability of a male and a female population.

Summers’ argument was that when you’re looking at candidates for fields like “physicists at a top twenty-five research university,” you’re talking about genuine geniuses — people to the far, far right of the intelligence distribution:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!heM1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F849fa4dd-13fe-4af6-9ba4-8d3bc43dcafb_949x525.png)

And if, as the theory suggests, there are more males at the extremes, this could translate to significantly more candidates for these tippy-top positions. I had ChatGPT mock up a very rough, simplified version of this on a −10 to 10 scale.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JZ0A!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0893e43-f94b-497e-a109-10a9db52421a_1869x1101.png)

It doesn’t entirely matter if we’re talking about “IQ,” per se, argued Summers. He claimed that “whatever the set of attributes are that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at MIT or being a chemist at Berkeley, those are probably different in their standard deviations as well.” Meaning you’ll get some version of the above graph. (Note that in the above graph we’re assuming the two sexes have the same mean, or average, on the measure in question. If in fact men enjoyed even a slight advantage, means-wise, that would only skew the ratio of ultra-top-performing men to women even further.)

I completely understand why this theory is unpopular in some quarters. Summers was stating, rather bluntly, that there are a lot more male geniuses (as the term has traditionally been defined) than female ones, and he was doing so at a conference on diversity, at a time when women were just starting to make real — albeit stalled — inroads into certain corners of academia.

This is what happens when you open the Pandora’s box of this sort of differences talk: You might not like what you find. But I do think many critics fixate on one side of the ledger at the expense of the other. If the theory holds that significantly more men are destined to be both top-level physics scholars and murderers — and at present, about 88% of murders in the U.S. are committed by males — one can only extract claims of “superiority” (or inferiority) by ignoring the broader picture. According to this theory, men are responsible for a massively disproportionate amount of the world’s most awful social ills.

In any case, the response really was furious. [Writing in](https://newrepublic.com/article/68044/sex-ed) *[The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/68044/sex-ed)*, Steven Pinker summed up some of the responses:

> Nancy Hopkins, the eminent MIT biologist and advocate for women in science, stormed out of the room to avoid, she said, passing out from shock. An engineering dean called his remarks “an intellectual tsunami,” and, with equal tastelessness, a *Boston Globe* columnist compared him to people who utter racial epithets or wear swastikas. Alumnae threatened to withhold donations, and the National Organization of Women called for his resignation. Summers was raked in a letter signed by more than 100 Harvard faculty members and shamed into issuing serial apologies.

Pinker also argued that many of Summers’ critics were simply making logical leaps from the actual content of his remarks:

> Conservative columnists have had a field day pointing to the Harvard hullabaloo as a sign of runaway political correctness at elite universities. Indeed, the quality of discussion among the nation’s leading scholars and pundits is not a pretty sight. Summers’s critics have repeatedly mangled his suggestion that innate differences might be one cause of gender disparities (a suggestion that he drew partly from a literature review in my book, *The Blank Slate*) into the claim that they must be the only cause. And they have converted his suggestion that the statistical distributions of men’s and women’s abilities are not identical to the claim that all men are talented and all women are not — as if someone heard that women typically live longer than men and concluded that every woman lives longer than every man. Just as depressing is an apparent unfamiliarity with the rationale behind political equality, as when Hopkins sarcastically remarked that, if Summers were right, Harvard should amend its admissions policy, presumably to accept fewer women. This is a classic confusion between the factual claim that men and women are not indistinguishable and the moral claim that we ought to judge people by their individual merits rather than the statistics of their group.

Summers promptly [posted an apology](https://www.harvard.edu/president/news-speeches-summers/2005/letter-from-president-summers-on-women-and-science/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), but it wasn’t enough. In March of 2005, there was a [faculty vote of no confidence](https://www.chronicle.com/article/harvard-faculty-votes-no-confidence-in-the-universitys-president/), and the following January Summers resigned. While [there were other factors and many points of tension between his office and Harvard faculty](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/2/22/faculty-uproar-led-to-ouster-the/), this seems to be the most direct precipitant of his departure.

Whatever one thinks of the Summers controversy, there is an undeniable asymmetry in academia. In vast swathes of the scholarly world, if you suggest that a given sex disparity is the result of discrimination, nothing bad will happen to you. This is the argument you’re *supposed* to make. If, on the other hand, you broaden out your theorizing to include the possibility that disparities are driven in part by deep-seated — potentially biologically driven — sex differences in certain interests or aptitudes, to a certain extent you are working with a time bomb strapped to your desk. Maybe it won’t go off! There are certainly academics who work on these questions (among them Cory Clark and Bo Winegard). But there’s also a real possibility that you will get yourself in deep professional trouble for making an argument that is perfectly reasonable in light of the available data.

I don’t get the sense that things had changed that much in mainstream academic circles since Summers’ resignation. I ran this idea by Pinker. “Sadly, I’d have to agree with you,” he responded in an email. “There are exceptions, but by and large mainstream social science departments don’t have a climate that would encourage disinterested research on sex differences.”

### A Violently Angry and Terrifyingly Delusional Screed

A rerun of the Summers controversy — a more mainstream one — occurred more than a decade later, in August 2017. James Damore was a young Google engineer. On an internal message board, he posted a 10-page document titled “ [Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/Teaching/ECS188/PDF_files/Damore.pdf) ” arguing that some of the company’s diversity efforts were misguided given, well, Summers-esque arguments (though he doesn’t mention Summers by name). He also argued against certain diversity initiatives, including “Programs, mentoring, and classes only for people with a certain gender or race.”

As I noted at the time, [many of the document’s basic claims about sex-differences research were sound](https://archive.is/q2DfJ), though Damore also made some leaps in (for example) his attempts to connect evolutionary psychology principles to specific outcomes at places like Google. If you are familiar with the basics of the sex-research literature, this just isn’t a particularly offensive or misguided document.

But the same thing happened to Damore as happened to Summers: A set of arguments supposed to be made for a private argument went public, generating a tremendous amount of outrage. The Damore case was different simply because society, in 2017, was so much more hyperconnected than it was in 2005. Overnight, he went from a nobody to a household name, mostly as a result of a wave of overwhelmingly negative coverage. An army of online pundits and a number of well-read outlets pretended Damore’s memo was an insanely bigoted, scientifically dunderheaded “screed” (I’ll always remember *[Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320)* [using that term](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320), given how unscreedlike the actual document is). Soon, he was fired, and — as these things tend to shake out — he began making the rounds as a free-speech martyr (I can’t really blame him for that!).

My point is not that research on this subject has been successfully censored outright, or that no one is doing it. Some people are doing it. But, again, it’s one of those subjects that can simply blow up in your face at any moment; it’s a difficult thing to study, and you will face a lot of potential hostility from your colleagues — or even, if you’re particularly unlucky, from society at large — if you do.

Ideally, research into sex differences (or anything else) would include a lot of collaboration between those who come from different disciplines and who have different vantage points. It wouldn’t be siloed. But it *is* siloed, because so many mainstream areas of academia have effectively shut themselves off to the possibility that biology is real and matters to sex differences. That has left the researchers who believe in this theory a bit cut off from everyone else, and has probably cost us a lot of potentially productive research and insight into this field.

It isn’t fair to blame the current overclaiming about “feminization” on mainstream academia. If an academic or other public intellectual decides to publicly make a claim, then they bear responsibility for it. But I’m worried that the response to what’s going on now will be “Ha ha, silly misogynistic conservatives,” a wave of outrage, and then the next thing rather than any sort of genuine interrogation into the stunted nature of sex-differences research.

In any case, in Part 2 I’ll dive deeper into the claims themselves. Some of them are reasonable, but a lot of them strike me as deeply shoddy reasoning.
