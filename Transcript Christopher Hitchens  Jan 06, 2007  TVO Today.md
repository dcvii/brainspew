## Transcript: Christopher Hitchens | Jan 06, 2007

\[Theme music plays\]

  

The opening sequence rolls. The logo of “Big Ideas” featuring a lit lamp bulb appears against an animated green slate.

Then, Andrew Moodie appears in the studio. The walls are decorated with screens featuring lit lamp bulbs, and two signs read “Big ideas.”

Andrew is in his early forties, clean-shaven, with short curly black hair. He’s wearing a gray sweater.

  

He says HELLO!

I'M ANDREW MOODIE AND THIS IS

BIG IDEAS.

NOW, WHEN LAST SUMMER, MEL

GIBSON WAS STOPPED IN CALIFORNIA

FOR SPEEDING AND DRUNK DRIVING,

A LEAKED POLICE REPORT DESCRIBED

A DRUNKEN GIBSON DECLARING THAT

JEWS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE

WARS IN THE WORLD.

AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT, YOU

KNOW, I HAD TO ASK MYSELF...

WHAT IF HE'S RIGHT?

SO I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH AND I

WAS SURPRISED TO DISCOVER THAT

KIM IL-SUNG, THE FOUNDER OF

NORTH KOREA WHO ATTACKED SOUTH

KOREA IN 1950, WAS ACTUALLY BORN

KIM IL GOLDBERG!

AND GENERAL PERVEZ MUSHARAF?

LEADER OF PAKISTAN, A COUNTRY

POISED FOR NUCLEAR CONFLICT WITH

INDIA?

I FIND OUT THAT HIS REAL NAME IS

MANISHEVITZ!

OKAY, SO THE INFORMATION COMES

FROM jewsruletheworld.com

BUT WHAT IF??

THEN, EVEN IF IT ISN'T TRUE, CAN

ONE JUST ASK QUESTIONS?

AS IN, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT...

UH, FORMULATING A HYPOTHESIS?

\[Chuckles\]

THAT'S RIGHT, A HYPOTHESIS.

ALL KIDDING ASIDE, GIBSON WAS

SKEWERED BY THE MEDIA AND

RIGHTLY SO.

BUT HIS STATEMENTS WERE NOT

INTENDED FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION.

IT WAS A DRUNKEN RANT AIMED AT A

POLICE OFFICER.

IS THAT A HATE CRIME?

WELL, HOW ABOUT DAVID AHENAKEW,

A FORMER CHIEF OF THE ASSEMBLY

OF FIRST NATIONS AND A

RECIPIENT OF THE ORDER OF

CANADA, WHO ONCE TOLD A REPORTER

THAT HITLER WAS ATTEMPTING TO

CLEAN UP THE WORLD WHEN HE FRIED

6 MILLION JEWS IN THE HOLOCAUST?

HE WAS CHARGED AND FOUND GUILTY

OF PROMOTING HATRED.

HIS ORDER OF CANADA WAS TAKEN

AWAY AND HE WAS CHARGED 1,000 dollars.

NOW HERE'S THE QUESTION OF

TODAY'S EPISODE--

SHOULD HE HAVE BEEN?

IS FREE SPEECH TRULY FREE IF YOU

CAN'T SAY THINGS THAT ARE

ABHORRENT, DESPICABLE...

WRONG?

OR TO PUT IT MORE SUCCINCTLY,

DOES FREEDOM OF SPEECH INCLUDE

THE FREEDOM TO HATE?

AND IF YOU PUT 'BE IT RESOLVED'

IN FRONT OF IT, WHAT YOU GET IS

THE PROPER WAY OF FORMULATING

CANADIAN PARLIAMENTARY-STYLE

DEBATE, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED

EARLIER THIS FALL WHEN THE HART

HOUSE DEBATING CLUB AT THE

UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO ENGAGED

WITH THE RESOLUTION IN FRONT OF

A PACKED AUDITORIUM.

COULD IT BE BECAUSE SOMEONE VERY

CONTROVERSIAL AND FAMOUS WAS

GOING TO SPEAK?

LET'S WAIT TO FIND OUT.

AND IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S HEAR

THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR AND

AGAINST HATE SPEECH AS FREE SPEECH.

  

A clip plays in which a young man dressed in a black robe sits behind a desk in a wood-lined auditorium.

A caption reads “Ethan Hoddes as Speaker of the House.”

  

Ethan says I MUST WARN

MEMBERS THAT, IN THIS HOUSE,

THERE WILL BE NO SMOKING, NO

TAKING OF SNUFF...

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Ethan continues NO DISCHARGING

OF FIREARMS, RINGING OF CELL

PHONES, OR ANY OTHER DISORDERLY

CONDUCT.

THE RESOLUTION BEFORE THE HOUSE

TODAY IS: BE IT RESOLVED THAT

FREEDOM OF SPEECH INCLUDES THE

FREEDOM TO HATE.

  

Interjection: HEAR HEAR!

  

\[Applause\]

  

Another man in his twenties appears at the podium. He has short brown hair and wears glasses and a black suit.

A caption reads “James Renihan as Prime Minister.”

  

James says LADIES AND

GENTLEMEN, SECTION 3.19, SUB. 2

OF THE CANADIAN CRIMINAL CODE

MAKES IT A CRIMINAL OFFENCE TO

WILFULLY PROMOTE HATRED AGAINST

ANY IDENTIFIABLE GROUP BY

COMMUNICATING STATEMENTS OTHER

THAN IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

AND AN INDIVIDUAL WHO VIOLATES THIS LAW

AND PROMOTES HATRED AGAINST AN

IDENTIFIABLE GROUP CAN BE PUT IN

PRISON FOR UP TO 2 YEARS.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE VALUE

OF SPEECH AND THE REASON WHY IT

IS RECOGNIZED AS A FUNDAMENTAL

RIGHT IN ALL LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES

IS THAT, WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO

SPEAK FREELY AND SPEAK YOUR

MIND, YOU ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY

SELF-ACTUALIZE YOURSELF AND

FULFILL YOURSELF.

YOU ARE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE TO THE

WORLD WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU

BELIEVE IN.

IF YOU RESTRICT PEOPLE FROM

SPEAKING THESE THINGS AND LEAVE

THEM MAINLY TO THE WORLD OF

THOUGHTS AND BELIEFS, YOU DENY

THEIR EXISTENCE AS A SOCIAL

PERSON, SOMEONE WHO'LL REALLY

ONLY FIND THEIR REALIZATION AND

LET THE WORLD KNOW WHO THEY ARE

IF THEY CAN SPEAK ABOUT THE

THINGS THAT THEY HOLD NEAREST

AND DEAREST TO THEM.

IT IS AN UNFORTUNATE REALITY

THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK

THAT A CORE PART OF THEIR

PERSONALITY, AND THAT SOMETHING

THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM,

MANIFESTS ITSELF IN HATRED

TOWARDS OTHER GROUPS AND BELIEFS

ABOUT THOSE GROUPS.

AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

MUST PROTECT IF WE BELIEVE

INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO

ACTUALLY BE INDIVIDUALS IN

SOCIETY.

AND IF WE LOOK TO THE HEURISTIC

DEVICE OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT, I

WOULD PUT TO YOU THAT NO

INDIVIDUAL WOULD AGREE TO

RELINQUISH THE RIGHT TO BE AN

INDIVIDUAL MERELY FOR THE

SECURITY THAT THE STATE OFFERS THEM.

INDEED, CONDEMNING PEOPLE'S

ABILITY TO SPEAK TELLS THEM THAT

THEY CANNOT ANNOUNCE TO THE

WORLD WHO THEY ARE AND BE THE

PERSON THAT THEY SEE THEMSELVES

TO BE, AND THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

WE CAN EVER TAKE AWAY FROM

SOMEONE SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DON'T

LIKE THE KINDS OF THINGS THEY'RE

TALKING ABOUT.

RORY.

  

Rory says BUT WHEN

SOMEBODY'S IDEA OF

SELF-ACTUALIZATION GOES BEYOND

SPEECH TO ACTUAL VIOLENCE, WE

RESTRICT THAT.

SO SPEECH THAT HAS A PROBABLE

CONSEQUENCE OF VIOLENCE, WHY IS

THAT ALLOWED?

  

James says WELL, I THINK

THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE

VIOLENCE IS SOMETHING THAT

ACTUALLY CONCRETELY AND DIRECTLY

INTERFERES IN ANOTHER

INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO ACTUALLY

BE THEMSELVES AND TO

SELF-ACTUALIZE IN SOCIETY.

SO THAT IS WHERE WE CRIMINALIZE

THOSE THINGS AND ANY INDIVIDUAL

WHO, BECAUSE THEY HEAR HATED

SPEECH, RESULTS IN ATTACKING

ANOTHER, THAT PERSON SHOULD

CERTAINLY BE PUT IN JAIL AND

SHOULD HAVE THEIR RIGHTS

CURTAILED.

BUT TO BAR IT FROM THE OUTSET,

TO SAY THAT “JUST IN CASE

SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN, WE REFUSE

TO ALLOW YOU TO BE AN

INDIVIDUAL” IS NOT PERMISSIBLE

IN A PROPERLY-WORKING LIBERAL

DEMOCRACY.

THE SECOND ARGUMENT I'D LIKE TO

LOOK AT IS THE PROBLEM OF

SELF-CENSORSHIP THAT ARISES IN

THESE CASES.

NOW, I PUT TO YOU, LADIES AND

GENTLEMEN, THAT MOST OF US

PROBABLY ARE NOT SURE WHAT

EXACTLY CONSTITUTES HATE SPEECH.

WHAT ARE ITS LIMITS?

WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO

TO COME WITHIN THE AMBIT OF THIS

PROVISION?

AND THE PROVISION IS AS I READ

TO YOU AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

SPEECH.

IT NECESSARILY NEEDS TO BE BROAD

IF IT'S TO HAVE ANY PURCHASE IN

SOCIETY AT ALL.

WE CANNOT SIMPLY STIPULATE WHICH

THINGS ARE HATRED AND WHICH ARE

NOT.

BUT THE NECESSARY RESULT OF THIS

IS THAT THERE WILL BE MANY

INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONCERNED

THAT SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO SAY

MIGHT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF

THIS STATUTE, MIGHT ACTUALLY BE

HATE SPEECH, AND THUS WILL ELECT

NOT TO SAY THESE THINGS BECAUSE,

SHOCKINGLY ENOUGH, THEY DO NOT

WANT TO BE A CRIMINAL AND THEY

DO NOT WANT TO RISK GOING TO

JAIL FOR 2 YEARS EVEN IF IT'S

ACTUALLY THE CASE THAT THIS IS

LIKELY TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY'RE

WORRIED ABOUT IT HAPPENING.

NOW WHAT IS THE RESULT OF THIS?

THIS MEANS INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY

SELF-CENSOR THE THINGS THEY'RE

GONNA SAY IN WAYS THAT ARE

DETRIMENTAL, NOT SIMPLY TO THEM,

BUT TO SOCIETY AT LARGE.

BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE THE CASE

THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT

HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ON

IMMIGRATION ISSUES, ON FOREIGN

POLICY ISSUES, ON ISSUES OF

RELIGION AND SOCIETY, ON ISSUES

OF CANADIAN INVOLVEMENT AROUND

THE WORLD, ON ISSUES OF

TERRORISM THAT THEY WORRY ABOUT

BRINGING INTO A POLITICAL

DISCOURSE BECAUSE THEY FEAR THAT

THOSE COMMENTS MIGHT BE TAKEN AS

HATE SPEECH, BECAUSE THEY STATE

THAT A CERTAIN RACE SHOULDN'T BE

ALLOWED TO IMMIGRATE.

THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE CONCERNED

ABOUT CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THE

WORLD.

AND THESE ARE COMMENTS THAT,

WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THEM OR

NOT, NEED TO EXIST WITHIN THE

DEMOCRATIC DISCUSSION THAT THE

SOCIETY IS BASED ON.

NOW, THIRDLY AND FINALLY, I

WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IT

IS IN FACT DETRIMENTAL AND

INJURIOUS TO THE ACTUAL AIMS OF

THIS LEGISLATION TO BAR THE

PUBLIC DISCOURSE OF HATRED.

NOW, I ASSUME THAT IN DRAFTING

THIS POSITION, THE INDIVIDUALS

WHO SUPPORT IT WOULD LIKE IT TO

BE EFFECTIVE.

THAT THEY, IN FACT, WOULD LIKE

TO SEE HATE SPEECH DISAPPEAR

FROM PUBLIC SPACES.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

THIS MEANS THAT WHEN SOMEONE

MAKES A COMMENT THAT IS HATEFUL

TOWARDS A RACE, ETHNICITY, OR

ANY GROUP WITHIN OUR SOCIETY,

THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THAT

SOCIETY TO CALL IT OUT, TO

INTERROGATE IT, AND TO POINT OUT

ITS HISTORICAL INACCURACIES, ITS

FACTUAL INACCURACIES, ITS

IRRATIONALITY, OR THE FACT THAT

IT ACTUALLY MAKES PEOPLE FEEL

UNCOMFORTABLE.

AND WHEN YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO

INTERROGATE THESE THINGS, YOU

ACTUALLY LOSE THE ABILITY TO GET

AT THE ROOT CAUSES AND FEELING

AND ISSUES THAT ACTUALLY CAUSE

SUCH HATE SPEECH TO EXIST.

SO WHILE CHRISTINA AND I SAY ALL

PEOPLE SHOULD BE FREE TO SPEAK,

WE DO BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE

FREE TO SPEAK.

IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ALWAYS

APPROVE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE

SAYING IN CONTENT.

BUT IF WE WANT TO HAVE AN EQUAL

SOCIETY, WE NEED TO REALLY

ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS AND SHOW

THEM TO BE WRONG.

MERELY CREATING THE TABOO OF

CRIMINALITY AND TRYING TO ERASE

THEM ENTIRELY DOES NOTHING.

IT ALLOWS THE PRIVATE DISCOURSE

TO EXISTS IN HOMES AND

SCHOOLYARDS, TO BE THE ONLY AREA

WHERE THESE ISSUES ARE BROACHED

AND, THUS, IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE

WAY TO HELP PEOPLE, WE PROUDLY

PROPOSE.

  

\[Applause\]

  

A woman in her early twenties with short chestnut hair appears at the podium.

A caption reads “Adrienne Lipsey as Member of the Opposition.”

  

Adrienne says TODAY, WE'RE

TALKING ABOUT TWO CONSTRUCTIVE

POINTS.

THE FIRST IS GONNA HAVE TO DO

WITH THE INDIVIDUAL HARMS THAT

ARE COMING OUT OF THE PRESENCE

OF HATE SPEECH IN CANADIAN SOCIETY.

AND THE SECOND HAS TO DO WITH OUR

CONFLICTING MODEL ABOUT WHAT

FREEDOM OF SPEECH MEANS, AND THE

VALUE THAT IT HAS IN THAT SAME

SOCIETY.

THEN, OF COURSE, WE'LL BE

TELLING YOU WHY EVERYTHING

THAT'S BEEN SAID ON SIDE

GOVERNMENT TODAY IN THAT ONE

SPEECH, THEY'VE ALREADY MESSED IT UP.

IT'S ALREADY WRONG.

SO WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

TODAY ON SIDE OPPOSITION?

WE POSIT TO YOU IN THE AUDIENCE

AND YOU, Mr. SPEAKER, THAT THE

WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN TODAY,

ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT SOUND TRITE,

IS A MORE GLOBALIZED ONE THAN

WE'VE BEEN LIVING IN THE PAST.

WE DO HAVE THAT GLOBAL VILLAGE

AND, AS I ROLL MY EYE BECAUSE

IT'S A BIT OF A CLICHE, WE OUGHT

TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S TRUE.

WE'RE INTERACTING WITH DIFFERENT

PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT

ETHNICITIES ON A GREATER SCOPE

THAN EVER BEFORE, AND WE THINK

THAT DEMANDS A CERTAIN AMOUNT

OF SENSITIVITY AROUND THESE

ESPECIALLY INFLAMMATORY AND

VOLATILE THINGS SUCH AS HATE

SPEECH.

SO, FOR THAT REASON, WE THINK

THAT THERE IS AN EGREGIOUS HARM

THAT CAN BE DONE BECAUSE WE HAVE

PEOPLE INTERACTING IN A WAY THAT

THEY'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.

SO LET'S LOOK AT THE INDEPENDENT

HARM THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE

PEOPLE HAVING HATE SPEECH AS

PART OF THE DISCOURSE.

WE THINK, JUST LIKE REN DOES,

THAT SELF-ACTUALIZATION IS AN

IMPORTANT THING.

BUT WE THINK THAT

SELF-ACTUALIZATION WHICH--

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T IN

ON THE JARGON, IT IS JUST

BASICALLY POSITING YOURSELF AS

A PERSON IN THE SOCIAL REALM--

IS VERY, VERY MUCH SOMETHING

THAT'S DAMAGED WHEN YOU'RE BEING

HATED AT ALL THE TIME.

WE THINK THAT'S AN INTUITIVE AND

UNDERSTANDABLE THING, BUT WE

NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT

HARMS THAT COME FROM BEING PART

OF A MINORITY GROUP THAT IS

BEING SEGREGATED AND

SYSTEMATICALLY HAVING HATRED

FLUNG AT YOU.

WE THINK THAT IT RUINS YOUR

ABILITY TO JUST FUNCTION AS AN

EQUAL PART OF SOCIETY EVEN IF

THERE ARE LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR

YOU AS A LEGAL PART OF SOCIETY

BECAUSE THERE'S NO CULTURAL

WEIGHT BEHIND THAT, OR YOU FEEL

THAT YOU ARE ALIENATED.

WE THINK THAT THAT IS A HUGE

DAMAGE TO SELF-ACTUALIZATION.

IT MEANS YOU CAN'T PARTICIPATE

FULLY BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS A

CONSTANT AND OFTEN VEHEMENT,

POTENTIALLY RACIST VOICE

TELLING YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT

WELCOME THERE.

SO, FOR THAT REASON, WE THINK

THAT THIS IS A VERY STRONG HARM

THAT WE NEED TO PREVENT,

ESPECIALLY WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU IN

LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

MORE PEOPLE INTERACTING FROM

DIFFERENT, DISPARATE

EXPERIENCES.

THE MORE INTERESTING POINT, I

THINK, IS THE IDEA OF

SELF-CENSORSHIP.

AND THE IDEA HERE, AS BROUGHT TO

YOU BY SIDE GOVERNMENT, IS THAT

THIS IS A VERY AMBIGUOUS THING,

THIS PROPOSITION, AS OUTLINED IN

THE CRIMINAL CODE, LIKE WE DON'T

REALLY KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET IT

AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE TO

FORCE THEIR OWN CONSIDERATION ON

THE MATTER.

AND WE DON'T REALLY SEE A MARKED

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS FORCED

CONSIDERATION ON THE PERSONS'

BEHALF OF THEMSELVES, AND

POTENTIALLY BRINGING THAT DEBATE

OUT INTO THE PUBLIC SPHERE.

WE THINK IF THIS PERSON HAS THE

CONVICTION WHICH WOULD LEAD TO

ANY SORT OF CONSTRUCTIVE

DEMOCRATIC ANALYSIS OR ANY

CONSTRUCTIVE DISCOURSE, THEY'RE

GONNA SAY IT ANYWAY.

WITH THIS WORMING OUT,

POTENTIALLY, WE WILL ADMIT, ARE

PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF

AMBIVALENT ABOUT THEIR VIEWS AND

ARE CONSIDERING SAYING SOMETHING

THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

BELIEVE IN.

WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.

WE WANT TO COMBAT PEOPLE WHO ARE

ON THE FENCE ON ISSUES SUCH AS

HATRED AND RACISM BECAUSE THAT

WILL SORT OF STEM THE TIDE OF A

SORT OF GROUP MENTALITY, WHICH

LEADS TO BAD THINGS LIKE

GENOCIDE OR MORE, IN A CANADIAN

CONTEXT, THE IDEA OF DEFAMING

GRAVES, ETC.

WE THINK THAT GROUP MENTALITY

AND THAT AMBIGUITY OF THOUGHT IS

SOMETHING WE WANT TO COMPETE.

SO, BECAUSE I'VE TOLD YOU TODAY

ABOUT HOW WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

OUR OWN MULTICULTURALISM AND,

MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE TO

RECOGNIZE THE INDEPENDENT HARMS

THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS,

AND FOR EVERYTHING ELSE THEY'VE

SAID, WE BEG TO OPPOSE.

  

Interjection: HEAR! HEAR!

  

\[Applause\]

  

Now another woman in her twenties, with short black hair, appears at the podium.

A caption reads “Christina Veira as Minister of the Crown.”

  

Christina says WE ON THIS

SIDE OF THE HOUSE TODAY BELIEVE

THAT EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT

HATRED IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

SHOULDN'T HAVE IN SOCIETY, AND

THAT IT IS GREATLY DETRIMENTAL

TO SOCIETY, WE DON'T BELIEVE IT

IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD

NECESSARILY BE PUTTING PEOPLE IN

JAIL FOR.

WE BELIEVE

THE MERE ACT OF JUST GETTING UP

AND SAYING THAT “I HATE GROUP X;

I BELIEVE THAT GROUP X SHOULDN'T

BE HERE,” NOT INCITING PEOPLE TO

NECESSARILY GET RID OF THEM, NOT

TELLING PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW WHO

WILL COMMIT A CRIME, FOR

EXAMPLE--

SORRY, AS REN WAS TALKING ABOUT.

WHEN YOU GO ON A RADIO SHOW--

NOT RIGHT NOW, THANK YOU--

WHEN YOU GO ON A RADIO SHOW, AND

YOU GOT UP AND YOU SAY THAT YOU

HATE A CERTAIN GROUP, THAT'S

CONSIDERED HATE SPEECH IN OUR

SETTING.

WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

PERSON AT THE KLAN'S MEETING,

KNOWING THAT THE GROUP OF YOUNG

KIDS ARE VERY WROUGHT UP, WANT

TO BEAT SOMEBODY UP, TELLING

THEM TO GO DO THAT, OR JUST

SPEWING HATE.

THAT'S NOT WHAT'S COVERED UNDER

THE HATE SPEECH.

UNDER HATE SPEECH, IT'S JUST IF

YOU GET UP AND SAY THAT YOU HATE

AND YOU SAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE

SHOULD.

WE BELIEVE ON THIS SIDE OF THE

HOUSE THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

YOU SHOULD BE GOING TO JAIL FOR.

WHETHER OR NOT OTHER PEOPLE DOWN

THE ROAD CHOOSE TO, 6 MONTHS

FROM NOW, ACT ON WHAT YOU HEARD,

WHETHER OR NOT YOUR OPINIONS

HAVE HAD SWAY ON THEM, THAT

ISN'T NECESSARILY YOUR PROBLEM,

BUT A PROBLEM WITH THAT PERSON

AND PERHAPS A PROBLEM WITH

SOCIETY AT LARGE.

ANYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY

THEIR OPINIONS WITHOUT HAVING IT

CENSORED AT ANY POINT, BUT I'LL

TAKE YOUR POINT.

  

Rory says ARE YOU

SERIOUSLY SUGGESTING THAT JERRY

FALWELL GOING ON THE RADIO AND

SAYING THAT GOD HATES FAGS IS

NOT CONNECTED TO GAY-BASHING?

  

Christina says WHAT I'M

GOING TO SAY IS THAT “GARY.”

FALWELL GOING ON THE RADIO AND

SAYING THAT GOD HATES FAGS--

IF HE DOES GET UP AND SAY THAT

AND OTHER PEOPLE LISTEN TO THAT

AND THEY CHOOSE TO GO OUT, THAT

DOES NOT, UH--

IF IT WAS--

IF HE SAID IT TO A GROUP WHERE

HE KNOWS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO

OUT AND GAY-BASH, THEN THAT

ISN'T COVERED UNDER THE CRIME.

WE'RE TALK--

IF HE DOES SAY IT AND PEOPLE

CHOOSE TO TAKE THAT INTO THEIR

ACCOUNT, THEY PROBABLY ALREADY

HELD THAT FEELINGS BEFORE.

THE FEELING OF HATRED WOULD

EXIST WHETHER OR NOT WE STIFLED

“GARY” FALWELL.

ALL THAT HAPPENS IS, WHEN WE

HAVE HIM ON THE RADIO SHOW, YOU

CAN ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS COMING

IN SAYING, “WHY DO YOU BELIEVE

THAT?”

BECAUSE UNTIL YOU CHOOSE TO

ENGAGE WITH IT, UNTIL YOU STOP

LOCKING UP PEOPLE JUST FOR

SPEWING THE HATE, AND RATHER

DEAL WITH WHY THEY HAVE IT IN

THE FIRST PLACE--

UNTIL YOU BELIEVE THAT, WE DON'T

BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING CAN

ACTUALLY COME ABOUT.

SO WE ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

HAVE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THE

VALUE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

WE'VE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT HOW

WHAT IT LEADS TO RIGHT NOW IS IT

LEADS TO SELF-CENSORSHIP, THESE

LAWS, AND LEADS TO MANY

DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS.

AND WE TALKED TO YOU FURTHERMORE

ABOUT HOW WE DON'T BELIEVE, IF

ANYTHING, THAT THIS SHOULD BE A

CRIMINAL ACT; THAT YOU SHOULD

NOT BE SEVERELY LIMITING ONE

PERSON'S FREEDOM FOR SPEWING

THEIR OWN OPINIONS.

AND FOR THESE REASONS, WE BEG TO

PROPOSE.

  

\[Applause\]

  

Now another man in his twenties with short black hair and a goatee appears at the podium.

A caption reads “Rory McKeown as Leader of the Opposition.”

  

Rory says RIGHTS ARE A

CONVENIENT FICTION THAT WE AS A

GROUP, WE AS A SOCIETY, BUY

INTO IN ORDER TO MAKE EVERYDAY

LIFE BEARABLE.

I DON'T HAVE A

RIGHT TO LIFE BECAUSE GOD CAME

DOWN AND SPAKE, “LO, RORY SHALL

HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE.”

IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, THAT'S

OKAY; YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT.

I HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE BECAUSE

IT WOULD BE AWFULLY INCONVENIENT

IF I STARTED DENYING THE RIGHTS

OF EVERYBODY ELSE TO LIFE.

AND SO, SOCIETY COMES TO A

CONSENSUS AND WE CREATE THE

FICTION OF A RIGHT TO LIFE.

THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF EVERY

SINGLE RIGHT.

EVERY RIGHT TO PROPERTY EXISTS

BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE HOLD

PROPERTY AND CAN PROFIT FROM IT,

THEY DEVELOP IT TO THE BENEFIT

OF THE COMMONS.

AND THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF

SPEECH.

SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY

ABOUT WHY THE FREE SPEECH, OR

THE DISCOURSE THAT WAS DISCUSSED

ON THE SIDE OF GOVERNMENT

BENCHES, IS ABSOLUTELY AND

TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO THIS

ROUND--

BECAUSE OF ONE VERY SIMPLE

FOUR-LETTER WORD.

AND THAT IS HATE.

HOW DOES HATE ADD TO DISCOURSE?

I ASKED, DOES JERRY FALWELL

STANDING UP AND SAYING “GOD

HATES FAGS” ACTUALLY ADD TO

DISCOURSE?

BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO TO Mr.--

Rev. FALWELL AND SAY, “PLEASE

JUSTIFY THAT RATIONALLY.”

HE'LL GO BACK THE BIBLE.

HATE IS THE LITTLE EJECTOR

BUTTON OF RATIONALITY FROM A

CONVERSATION.

IT'S WHEN YOU PULL BACK THE

ONION FAR ENOUGH AND FIND AT ITS

CORE THAT SOMEONE SIMPLY CANNOT

JUSTIFY THEIR BELIEFS AND

THERE'S A LITTLE KERNEL OF

HATRED RIGHT AT THE CENTRE.

'CAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S IRRATIONAL

ARGUMENT.

OTHERWISE, IT'S DISCOURSE.

BUT YOU'RE ALREADY DISAGREEING.

  

James says WELL, NO, EXACTLY!

THAT'S THE POINT.

SO WHEN JERRY FALWELL SAYS THIS,

YOU HAVE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE

IN THE WORLD POINTING OUT HOW

IRRATIONAL AND STUPID IT IS,

THUS TEACHING OTHERS THE

FALLACIES OF HATE INSTEAD OF

JUST RESTRICTING IT TO PRIVATE

HOUSEHOLDS, WHERE THERE IS NO

SUCH DISCUSSION.

  

Rory says RIGHT.

SO WHEN PEOPLE STAND UP AND SPEW

HATEFUL DISCOURSE, PEOPLE ARE

AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO RECOGNIZE

THAT THIS ISN'T TRUE.

BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE SUBSCRIBE TO

ERNST ZUNDEL'S PAMPHLETS DENYING

THE HOLOCAUST.

EVEN THOUGH ERNST ZUNDEL TRIED

TO CLAIM THAT UFOs WERE NAZI

TECHNOLOGY THAT HAD SPIRITED

AWAY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE THIRD

REICH TO ANTARCTICA.

NOBODY WHO WAS BUYING THESE

PAMPHLETS, WHO WAS PAYING FOR

THESE PUBLICATIONS, SEEMED TO

NOTICE THIS.

'CAUSE EVERYTHING WE'VE HEARD

FROM REN AND FROM CHRISTINA IS

GENEROUS AND KIND AND GOOD.

BUT IT PRESUMES THAT WE'RE

DEALING WITH RATIONAL ACTORS.

I WANT TO DEAL WITH CHRISTINA'S

CONSTRUCTIVE POINT--

BECAUSE SHE SAID MAKING THIS

CRIMINAL IS WHAT'S WRONG.

MAKING SPEAKING YOUR OPINIONS

CRIMINAL IS A TERRIBLE THING.

BUT I'D ASK YOU, IF I HATE A

GROUP ENOUGH TO GO ON THE RADIO

AND TALK ABOUT HOW I HATE THEM,

IS IT REASONABLE FOR ME TO

ASSUME THAT SOMEONE'S VIEWS

MIGHT BE MORE EXTREME, AND THAT

SOMEONE MIGHT GO OUT AND HURT

PEOPLE?

I THINK IT'S REASONABLE.

AND WE DO PROSECUTE PEOPLE FOR

REASONABLY FORESEEABLE

CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS.

BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IN

CONTEXT BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVEN'T

HEARD VERY MUCH IS HOW OFTEN

SECTION 3.19, SUB. 2 IS ACTUALLY

USED AND AGAINST WHOM IT IS

USED, BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

THIS ISN'T GONNA PROSECUTE UNCLE

RANDY, WHO HAS A FEW TOO MANY

BEERS AT DINNER AND STARTS

RAMBLING INTO A TIRADE AGAINST

IMMIGRANTS.

THIS IS USED AGAINST ACADEMICS

WHO USE THEIR POSITION OF POWER

TO ENFORCE THEIR OPINIONS ON

THEIR STUDENTS.

THIS IS USED AGAINST PEOPLE WHO

ARE DETERMINED ENOUGH IN THEIR

OPINIONS THAT THEY DO START

RADIO TALK SHOWS PREACHING

HATRED.

AND THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES

“WHOM ARE WE TRYING TO PROTECT

WITH THIS?”

BECAUSE YOU CAN STAND UP AND SAY

ANY OFFENSIVE THING YOU WANT IN

A ROOM LIKE THIS, AND ANY GROUP

THAT IS TARGETED BY WHAT YOU SAY

PROBABLY HAS THE GRAPES TO LOOK

YOU IN THE EYE AND SAY, “GET

LOST, THAT MAKES NO SENSE.”

BUT YOU CAN'T OFFER THAT KIND OF

JUSTIFICATION FOR THE BLACK KID

IN THE PLAYGROUND WHO'S PICKED

ON; YOU CAN'T OFFER THAT KIND

OF JUSTIFICATION TO THE GAY KID

IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO'S BASHED

BECAUSE THIS ENVIRONMENT IS

ALLOWED TO EXIST.

SO LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT MY

COLLEAGUE TOLD YOU.

SHE TOLD YOU THAT WE LIMIT

RIGHTS WHEN WE SEE NEGATIVE

CONSEQUENCES.

WE LIMIT PEOPLE'S FREEDOMS WHEN

WE SEE THAT EXERCISING THOSE

FREEDOMS CAN HAVE NEGATIVE

RAMIFICATIONS.

AND WE DIDN'T REALLY HEAR THIS,

ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FROM

CHRISTINA, EXCEPT TO SAY, “IF

YOU'RE JUST SAYING THE HATE,

YOU'RE NOT DOING THE HATE.”

BUT AS I'VE SHOWN YOU, YOU CAN

EXPECT THAT IF YOU'RE OUT THERE

PREACHING AND PROMOTING AND

PROMULGATING HATRED, THAT

SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO

LISTEN TO YOU.

THERE CLEARLY IS A MARKET FOR

THIS.

BUT WHAT HAVE WE HEARD FROM

GOVERNMENT TODAY?

WE HEARD A VERY SIMPLISTIC

ANALYSIS THAT TELLS YOU THAT

YOUR RIGHTS END WHERE YOUR

NEIGHBOUR'S NOSE BEGINS, WHICH

IS HOW WE EXPLAIN IT TO GRADE 5

STUDENTS.

BUT WE'RE NOT GRADE 5 STUDENTS.

AND I THINK WE CAN HAVE A

SLIGHTLY MORE SOPHISTICATED

DEBATE ABOUT WHERE SOMEBODY'S

NOSE BEGINS.

IS IT SIMPLY A QUESTION OF DOING

PHYSICAL HARM?

OR IS IT A QUESTION OF CREATING

A POISONED ENVIRONMENT?

  

James says ACTUALLY,

RORY, YOUR SOPHISTICATED

ANALYSIS WAS “THERE ARE NO

RIGHTS,” FULL STOP.

BUT I'D LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW IF

THERE ARE NO RIGHTS AT ALL, THEN

IS IT AT ALL INAPPROPRIATE TO

BAR ALL SPEECH?

WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE RULES THAT

YOU THINK GOVERN THE IDEA OF

WHEN WE GET TO LIMIT RIGHTS IF

THEY DO NOT EXIST?

  

Rory says AS I SAID, AS A

SOCIETY, WE'VE DEVELOPED A

CONSENSUS THAT WE ALL HAVE

CERTAIN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS

BECAUSE THEY'RE USEFUL.

WE ACCEPT FREEDOM OF SPEECH

BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THE TRUTH

IS IMPORTANT.

WE THINK THAT, IN GOVERNMENT

CERTAINLY, TRANSPARENCY IS

IMPORTANT, AND NEITHER IS

POSSIBLE WITHOUT FREEDOM OF

SPEECH.

BUT I'VE SHOWN YOU, REN, THAT

ALL THIS DISCOURSE THAT YOU WANT

TO PROMOTE, ALL THIS RATIONAL

DEBATE BETWEEN THE FORCES OF

TRUTH AND JUSTICE, AND THESE

HATE-MONGERS ACTUALLY CAN'T

HAPPEN 'CAUSE THERE IS NO

DEBATE.

PEOPLE WHO GET UP AND SPEW

RACIAL HATRED, WHO SPEW HATRED

AGAINST WOMEN, WHO SPEW

HOMOPHOBIA, AREN'T ACTUALLY

GOING TO RATIONALIZE IT TO YOU.

THEY AREN'T GONNA PRESENT

STUDIES THAT BACK UP WHAT THEY

THINK.

THEY'RE JUST GONNA SAY, “I

HATE.”

AND WITH THOSE TWO WORDS, THE

DEBATE HAS ENDED.

YOUR CHANCE OF PERSUADING THEM

IS GONE.

SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT IF

YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE ON THE

RADIO SAYING, “I HATE,” YOU

CREATE A CLIMATE OF FEAR.

I WALKED INTO THIS ROOM PAST A

YOUNG COUPLE, OBVIOUSLY VERY

MUCH IN LUST, TRADING SPIT IN

THE HALLWAY.

BUT A MAN AND A WOMAN.

HONESTLY, IF JERRY FALWELL

WEREN'T ON THE RADIO SAYING “GOD

HATES FAGS,” HOW MANY MORE GAY

MEN WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE

SHOWING AFFECTION IN PUBLIC?

AS SOON AS A MINORITY GROUP

FEELS IT HAS TO CHANGE ITS

BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE OF FEAR OF THE

DISAPPROVAL OF THE MAJORITY,

THAT'S THEIR FREEDOM TO

SELF-ACTUALIZE BEING INFRINGED

UPON.

AND IF THAT'S ACCOMPANIED BY

ACTUAL FEAR, I THINK THAT'S A

FAR MORE EGREGIOUS VIOLATION OF

RIGHTS THAN TELLING SOMEONE THEY

CAN'T STAND UP AND SAY “I HATE.”

WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS CARRIED A

RISK OF SELF-CENSORSHIP, THAT

PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE SURE IF WHAT

THEY WERE GOING TO SAY

CONSTITUTES HATE SPEECH.

I THINK THAT'S FINE.

I THINK IT'S OKAY TO MAKE

RATIONAL PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE

A DEBATE STOP AND THINK, “DO I

HAVE SOMETHING TO BACK UP MY

POSSIBLY INFLAMMATORY OPINION?”

WE'D CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT FEWER

BAR FIGHTS IF PEOPLE STARTED

DOING THIS.

I DON'T THINK IT'S WRONG TO

IMPOSE A RESPONSIBILITY ON

INDIVIDUALS TO CONSIDER HOW THEY

THINK AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, IT'S NOT AS

IF WE HAVEN'T HEARD IT BEFORE.

IT'S NOT AS IF THESE ARE NEW AND

CHALLENGING IDEAS THAT COULD

REFINE OUR IDEA OF WHAT MAKES

CIVIL SOCIETY.

THEY'RE TIRED, OLD IDEAS THAT

HAVE HAD THEIR TIME; THAT HAVE

BEEN TRIED AND BEEN REJECTED BY

A CIVIL SOCIETY.

AND IF THE SAD, PATHETIC PEOPLE

WHO WANT TO CONTINUE SPEWING

HATRED GET LOCKED UP, I HAVE

VERY LITTLE TIME FOR THOSE WHO

WOULD OPPOSE THIS BECAUSE,

SOONER OR LATER, THEY ARE GONNA

COME ACROSS IMPRESSIONABLE

MINDS, AND THAT'S THE CONTEXT

THAT ADRIENNE AND I HAVE TALKED

ABOUT.

'CAUSE IF ENOUGH PEOPLE SAY IT'S

OKAY TO HATE, THEN PEOPLE START

TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S OKAY TO

HURT.

AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A PRETTY

REASONABLE ASSUMPTION.

I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO

ASSUME THAT PEOPLE PROMOTING

HATRED CAN FORESEE THE

CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS IN

CONCRETE, HARMFUL ACTION.

AND SINCE WE DO CRIMINALIZE

ACTIONS THAT CAN PREDICTABLY

RESULT IN HARM, THIS IS AN

APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO IT.

YES, IT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION.

YES, FREEDOM OF SPEECH HAS

ACQUIRED SOME SORT OF TOTEMIC

VALUE IN WESTERN SOCIETY.

BUT IF FREEDOM OF SPEECH RESULTS

IN BLOODY NOSES, LITERAL BLOODY

NOSES, OR WORSE, THEN IT IS

ACCEPTABLE TO LIMIT IT JUST AS

WE WOULD LIMIT SOMEONE THROWING

A PUNCH.

AND WE STAND PROUDLY AGAINST

DECRIMINALIZING HATE SPEECH.

  

\[Applause\]

  

Now Christopher Hitchens appears at the podium. He’s in his late forties, clean-shaven, with short wavy brown hair. He’s wearing a black suit and a checkered shirt.

A caption reads “Christopher Hitchens as himself.”

  

Christopher says OKAY.

UM...

FIRE!

FIRE, FIRE, FIRE.

  

Suddenly, the clip stops and Andrew Moodie appears in the studio.

  

He says NO, NO,

THERE'S NO FIRE.

IT'S MORE LIKE THE FIREBRAND,

CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS INSTEAD!

THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE BIG

CROWD.

CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS IS A

JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR HAVING,

IN THE PAST, BECOME KNOWN FOR

HIS 'TAKE NO PRISONERS' ATTACK

ON HENRY KISSINGER, MOTHER

TERESA, AND BILL CLINTON.

TODAY, HITCHENS IS BEST KNOWN AS

A VIGOROUS DEFENDER OF THE U.S.

INCURSION INTO IRAQ AND OF THE

URGENT NEED TO FIGHT WHAT HE HAS

TERMED ISLAMO-FASCISM.

SO LET'S GO BACK TO CHRISTOPHER

HITCHENS SHOUTING 'FIRE!' IN A

CROWDED THEATRE.

  

The clip resumes.

  

Christopher says FIRE!

FIRE, FIRE, FIRE.

NOW YOU'VE HEARD IT.

NOT SHOUTED IN A CROWDED

THEATRE, ADMITTEDLY.

AS I REALIZE, I SEEM NOW TO HAVE

SHOUTED IT IN THE HOGWARTS

DINING ROOM.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues BUT THE

POINT IS MADE.

EVERYONE KNOWS THE FATUOUS

VERDICT OF THE GREATLY

OVER-PRAISED JUSTICE, OLIVER

WENDELL HOLMES, WHO ASKED FOR AN

ACTUAL EXAMPLE OF WHEN IT WOULD

BE PROPER TO LIMIT SPEECH OR

DEFY IT AS AN ACTION.

GAVE THAT OF SHOUTING 'FIRE'

IN A CROWDED THEATRE.

IT'S VERY OFTEN FORGOTTEN WHAT

HE WAS DOING IN THAT CASE WAS

SENDING TO PRISON A GROUP OF

YIDDISH-SPEAKING SOCIALISTS,

WHOSE LITERATURE WAS PRINTED IN

A LANGUAGE MOST AMERICANS

COULDN'T READ, OPPOSING

PRESIDENT WILSON'S PARTICIPATION

IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR, AND THE

DRAGGING OF THE UNITED STATES

INTO THIS SANGUINARY CONFLICT,

WHICH THE YIDDISH-SPEAKING

SOCIALISTS HAVE FLED FROM

RUSSIA TO ESCAPE.

IN FACT, IT COULD BE JUST AS

PLAUSIBLY ARGUED THAT THE

YIDDISH-SPEAKING SOCIALISTS WHO

WERE JAILED BY THE EXCELLENT AND

OVER-PRAISED JUDGE OLIVER

WENDELL HOLMES WERE THE REAL

FIREFIGHTERS; WERE THE ONES WHO

WERE SHOUTING 'FIRE' WHEN THERE

REALLY WAS FIRE IN A VERY

CROWDED THEATRE.

INDEED.

AND WHO IS TO DECIDE?

WELL, KEEP THAT QUESTION IF YOU

WOULD.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BROTHERS

AND SISTERS, I HOPE I MAY SAY

COMRADES AND FRIENDS.

BEFORE YOUR MINDS, I EXEMPT

MYSELF FROM THE SPEAKER'S KIND

OFFER OF PROTECTION THAT WAS SO

GENEROUSLY PROFFERED AT THE

OPENING OF THIS EVENING.

ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SAY ANYTHING

ABUSIVE ABOUT OR TO ME IS QUITE

FREE TO DO SO, AND WELCOME, IN

FACT.

AT THEIR OWN RISK.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues AND...

BUT BEFORE THEY DO THAT, THEY

MUST HAVE TAKEN, AS I'M SURE WE

ALL SHOULD, A SHORT REFRESHER

COURSE IN THE CLASSIC TEXT ON

THIS MATTER, WHICH ARE JOHN

MILTON'S

AREOPAGITICA,

AREOPAGITICA BEING THE GREAT

HILL OF ATHENS FOR DISCUSSION

AND FREE EXPRESSION...

THOMAS PAINE'S INTRODUCTION TO

THE AGE OF REASON, AND I WOULD

SAY JOHN STUART MILL'S ESSAY,

ON LIBERTY

IN WHICH IT

IS VARIOUSLY SAID.

ALSO, I'LL BE VERY DARING AND

SUMMARIZE ALL THREE OF THESE

GREAT GENTLEMEN OF THE GREAT

TRADITION OF ESPECIALLY ENGLISH

LIBERTY IN ONE GO.

WHAT THEY SAY IS IT'S NOT JUST

THE RIGHT OF THE PRESENT WHO

SPEAKS TO BE HEARD.

IT IS THE RIGHT OF EVERYONE IN

THE AUDIENCE TO LISTEN AND TO

HEAR.

AND EVERY TIME YOU SILENCE

SOMEBODY, YOU MAKE YOURSELF A

PRISONER OF YOUR OWN ACTION

BECAUSE YOU DENY YOURSELF THE

RIGHT TO HEAR SOMETHING.

IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR OWN RIGHT

TO HEAR AND BE EXPOSED IS AS

MUCH INVOLVED IN ALL THESE CASES

AS IS THE RIGHT OF THE OTHER TO

VOICE HIS OR HER VIEW.

INDEED, AS JOHN STUART MILL

SAID, IF ALL IN SOCIETY WERE

AGREED ON THE TRUTH AND BEAUTY

AND VALUE OF ONE PROPOSITION,

ALL EXCEPT ONE PERSON, IT WILL

BE MOST IMPORTANT--

IN FACT, IT WOULD BECOME EVEN

MORE IMPORTANT--

THAT THAT ONE HERETIC BE HEARD

BECAUSE WE WOULD STILL BENEFIT

FROM HIS PERHAPS OUTRAGEOUS OR

APPALLING VIEW.

IN MORE MODERN TIMES, THIS HAS

BEEN PUT, I THINK, BEST BY A

PERSONAL HEROINE OF MINE, ROSA

LUXEMBURG, WHO SAID THAT THE

FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS MEANINGLESS

UNLESS IT MEANS THE FREEDOM OF

THE PERSON WHO THINKS

DIFFERENTLY.

MY GREAT FRIEND, JOHN

O'SULLIVAN, FORMER EDITOR OF

THE NATIONAL REVIEW

AND I

THINK PROBABLY MY MOST

CONSERVATIVE AND REACTIONARY

CATHOLIC FRIEND, ONCE SAID,

UH...

IT'S A TINY THOUGHT EXPERIMENT.

HE SAYS, IF YOU HEAR THE POPE

SAYING HE BELIEVES IN GOD, YOU

THINK, WELL THE POPE'S DOING HIS

JOB AGAIN TODAY.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues IF YOU

HEAR THE POPE SAYING HE'S REALLY

BEGUN TO DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF

GOD, YOU BEGIN TO THINK HE MIGHT

BE ONTO SOMETHING.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues WELL...

IF EVERYBODY IN NORTH AMERICA IS

FORCED TO ATTEND AT SCHOOL A

TRAINING IN SENSITIVITY ON

HOLOCAUST AWARENESS AND IS

TAUGHT TO STUDY THE FINAL

SOLUTION ABOUT WHICH NOTHING WAS

ACTUALLY DONE BY THIS COUNTRY,

OR NORTH AMERICA, OR THE UNITED

KINGDOM WHILE IT WAS GOING ON.

BUT LET'S SAY AS IF IN

COMPENSATION FOR THAT,

EVERYONE'S MADE TO SWALLOW AN

OFFICIAL AND UNALTERABLE STORY

OF IT NOW, AND IT'S THOUGHT AS

THE GREAT MORAL EXEMPLAR, THE

MORAL EQUIVALENT OF THE MORALLY

LACKING ELEMENTS OF THE SECOND

WORLD WAR, THEY WAY OF STILLING

OUR UNEASY CONSCIENCE ABOUT THAT

COMBAT.

IF THAT'S THE CASE WITH

EVERYBODY AS IT MORE OR LESS IS,

THEN ONE PERSON GETS UP AND

SAYS, “YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS

HOLOCAUST?

I'M NOT SURE IT EVEN HAPPENED.

IN FACT, I'M PRETTY CERTAIN IT

DIDN'T.”

INDEED, I BEGIN TO WONDER IF THE

ONLY THING IS THAT THE JEWS

BROUGHT A LITTLE BIT OF VIOLENCE

ON THEMSELVES.

THAT PERSON DOESN'T JUST HAVE A

RIGHT TO SPEAK.

THAT PERSON'S RIGHT TO SPEAK

MUST BE GIVEN EXTRA PROTECTION

BECAUSE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY MUST

HAVE TAKEN HIM SOME EFFORT TO

COME UP WITH; MIGHT BE--

MIGHT CONTAIN A GRAIN OF

HISTORICAL TRUTH; UM...

MIGHT, IN ANY CASE, GIVE PEOPLE

TO THINK ABOUT WHY DO THEY KNOW

WHAT THEY ALREADY THINK THEY

KNOW?

HOW DO I KNOW THAT I KNOW THIS

EXCEPT THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN

TAUGHT THIS AND NEVER HEARD

ANYTHING ELSE?

IT'S ALWAYS WORTH ESTABLISHING

FIRST PRINCIPLES.

IT'S ALWAYS WORTH SAYING, “WHAT

WOULD YOU DO IF YOU MET A

FLAT-OUT SOCIETY MEMBER?”

“COME TO THINK OF IT, HOW CAN I

PROVE THE EARTH IS ROUND?”

“AM I SURE ABOUT THE THEORY OF

EVOLUTION?

I KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

TRUE.

HERE'S SOMEONE WHO SAYS THERE'S

NO SUCH THING AS ALL-INTELLIGENT

DESIGN.

HOW SURE AM I OF MY OWN VIEWS?”

DON'T TAKE REFUGE IN THE FALSE

SECURITY OF CONSENSUS AND THE

FEELING THAT WHATEVER YOU THINK,

YOU'RE BOUND TO BE OKAY BECAUSE

YOU'RE IN THE SAFELY MORAL

MAJORITY.

ONE OF THE PROUDEST MOMENTS OF

MY LIFE, THAT'S TO SAY IN THE

RECENT PAST, HAS BEEN DEFENDING

THE BRITISH HISTORIAN, DAVID

IRVING, WHO IS NOW IN PRISON IN

AUSTRIA FOR NOTHING MORE THAN

THE POTENTIAL OF UTTERING AN

UNWELCOME THOUGHT ON AUSTRIAN

SOIL.

HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY ANYTHING

IN AUSTRIA.

HE WASN'T EVEN ACCUSED OF SAYING

IT; HE WAS ACCUSED OF

PERHAPS

PLANNING TO SAY SOMETHING THAT

VIOLATED AN AUSTRIAN LAW THAT

SAYS, “ONLY ONE VERSION OF THE

HISTORY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR

MAY BE TAUGHT IN OUR BRAVE,

LITTLE TYROLEAN REPUBLIC THE

REPUBLIC THAT GAVE US KURT

WALDHEIM, A SECRETARY-GENERAL OF

THE UNITED NATIONS, A MAN WANTED

IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES FOR WAR CRIMES.

  

A caption appears on screen. It reads "Christopher Hitchens. Author, ‘Orwell’s victory.’ Hart House, University of Toronto. November 15, 2006."

  

Christopher continues YOU KNOW, THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE--

THAT HAS JORG HAIDER, THE

LEADER OF ITS OWN FASCIST PARTY,

IN THE CABINET THAT SENT DAVID

IRVING TO JAIL.

YOU KNOW THE TWO THINGS THAT

HAVE MADE AUSTRIA FAMOUS, GIVEN

IT ITS REPUTATION BY ANY CHANCE?

JUST WHAT I'VE GOT YOU.

I HOPE THERE ARE SOME AUSTRIANS

HERE TO BE UPSET BY IT.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues WELL, A

PITY IF NOT.

BUT THE TWO GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS

OF AUSTRIA ARE TO HAVE CONVINCED

THE WORLD THAT HITLER WAS GERMAN

AND BEETHOVEN WAS VIENNESE.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues NOW, TO

THIS PROUD RECORD, THEY CAN ADD,

THEY HAVE THE COURAGE, FINALLY,

TO FACE THEIR PAST AND LOCK UP A

BRITISH HISTORIAN WHO'S

COMMITTED NO CRIME EXCEPT THAT

OF THOUGHT AND WRITING.

AND THAT'S A SCANDAL.

AND I CAN'T FIND A SECONDER,

USUALLY, WHEN I PROPOSE THIS,

BUT I DON'T CARE.

I DON'T NEED A SECONDER.

MY OWN OPINION IS ENOUGH FOR ME

AND I CLAIM THE RIGHT TO HAVE IT

DEFENDED AGAINST ANY CONSENSUS,

ANY MAJORITY, ANYWHERE,

ANYPLACE, ANYTIME.

AND ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH

THIS CAN PICK A NUMBER, GET IN

LINE, AND KISS MY ASS.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

\[Smattering of applause\]

  

Christopher continues NOW, I

DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU DON'T

FEEL YOU'RE GROWN-UP ENOUGH TO

DECIDE THIS FOR YOURSELVES AND

THINKING YOU NEED TO BE

PROTECTED FROM DAVID IRVING'S

EDITION OF

THE GOEBBELS

DIARIES,

FOR EXAMPLE, OUT

OF WHICH I LEARNED MORE ABOUT

THE THIRD REICH THAN I HAD FROM

STUDYING HUGH TREVOR-ROPER AND

A.J.P. TAYLOR COMBINED WHEN I

WAS AT OXFORD.

BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO, I'D

RECOMMEND ANOTHER SHORT COURSE

OF REVISION.

GO AGAIN AND SEE NOT JUST THE

FILM AND THE PLAY BUT READ THE

TEXT OF ROBERT BOLT'S WONDERFUL

PLAY,

MAN FOR ALL SEASONS--

SOME OF YOU MUST'VE SEEN IT--

WHERE SIR THOMAS MORE DECIDES

THAT HE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN

LIE OR BETRAY HIS FAITH.

AND AT ONE MOMENT, MORE IS

ARGUING WITH A PARTICULARLY

VICIOUS WITCH-HUNTING

PROSECUTOR, A SERVANT OF THE

KING, AND A HUNGRY AND AMBITIOUS

MAN.

AND MORE SAYS TO THIS MAN, UM...

“YOU'D BREAK THE LAW TO PUNISH

THE DEVIL, WOULDN'T YOU?”

AND THE PROSECUTOR, THE

WITCH-HUNTER SAYS, “BREAK IT?!”

HE SAID.

“I'D CUT DOWN...

I'D CUT DOWN EVERY LAW IN

ENGLAND IF I COULD DO THAT, IF I

COULD CAPTURE HIM.”

AND MORE SAYS, “YES, YOU WOULD,

WOULDN'T YOU?

AND THEN, WHEN YOU CORNER THE

DEVIL AND THE DEVIL TURNED

AROUND TO MEET YOU, WHERE WOULD

YOU RUN FOR PROTECTION, ALL THE

LAWS OF ENGLAND HAVING BEEN CUT

DOWN AND FLATTENED?

WHO WOULD PROTECT YOU THEN?”

BEAR IN MIND, LADIES AND

GENTLEMEN, THAT EVERY TIME YOU

VIOLATE OR PROPOSE TO VIOLATE

THE FREE SPEECH OF SOMEONE ELSE,

YOU, IN POTENTIA, YOU'RE MAKING

A ROD FOR YOUR OWN BACK BECAUSE

THE OTHER QUESTION RAISED BY

JUSTICE OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES IS

SIMPLY THIS--

“WHO'S GOING TO DECIDE--

TO WHOM DO YOU AWARD THE RIGHT

TO DECIDE WHICH SPEECH IS

HARMFUL?”

OR WHO IS THE HARMFUL SPEAKER?

OR TO DETERMINE IN ADVANCE WHAT

ARE THE HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES

GOING TO BE THAT WE KNOW ENOUGH

ABOUT IN ADVANCE TO PREVENT?

TO WHOM WOULD GIVE THIS JOB?

TO WHOM ARE YOU GOING TO AWARD

THE TASK OF BEING THE CENSOR?

ISN'T IT A FAMOUS OLD STORY THAT

THE MAN WHO HAS TO READ ALL THE

PORNOGRAPHY IN ORDER TO DECIDE

WHAT'S FIT TO BE PASSED AND WHAT

IS FIT NOT TO BE, IS THE MAN

MOST LIKELY TO BECOME DEBAUCHED.

DID YOU HEAR ANY SPEAKER IN THE

OPPOSITION TO THIS MOTION,

ELOQUENT AS ONE OF THEM WAS, TO

WHOM YOU WOULD DELEGATE THE TASK

OF DECIDING FOR YOU WHAT YOU

COULD READ?

WHO WOULD, TO ME, WOULD GIVE THE

JOB OF DECIDING FOR YOU, RELIEVE

YOU OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

HEARING WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO

HEAR?

DO YOU KNOW ANYONE?

HANDS UP.

DO YOU KNOW ANYONE TO WHOM YOU

WOULD GIVE THIS JOB?

DOES ANYONE HAVE A NOMINEE?

YOU MEAN THERE'S NO ONE IN

CANADA GOOD ENOUGH TO DECIDE

WHAT I CAN READ?

OR HEAR?

I HAD NO IDEA.

BUT THERE'S A LAW THAT SAYS

THERE MUST BE SUCH A PERSON, OR

THERE'S A SUBSECTION OF SOME

PIDDLING LAW THAT SAYS IT.

WELL, TO HELL WITH THAT LAW

THEN.

IT'S INVITING YOU TO BE LIARS

AND HYPOCRITES, AND TO DENY WHAT

YOU EVIDENTLY KNOW ALREADY.

ABOUT THE CENSORIOUS INSTINCT,

WE BASICALLY KNOW ALL THAT WE

NEED TO KNOW AND WE'VE KNOWN IT

FOR A LONG TIME.

IT COMES FROM AN OLD STORY ABOUT

ANOTHER GREAT ENGLISHMAN; SORRY

TO SOUND SO PARTICULAR ABOUT

THAT THIS EVENING, Dr. SAMUEL

JOHNSON...

THE GREAT LEXICOGRAPHER, AUTHOR

OF THE FIRST--

COMPILER, I SHOULD SAY--

OF THE FIRST GREAT DICTIONARY OF

THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

WHEN IT WAS COMPLETE, Dr.

JOHNSON WAS WAITED UPON BY

VARIOUS DELEGATIONS OF PEOPLE TO

CONGRATULATE HIM...

OF THE NOBILITY OF THE QUALITY;

THE COMMONS, THE LORDS;

AND ALSO BY A DELEGATION OF

RESPECTABLE LADIES OF LONDON

WHO TENDED ON HIM IN HIS FLEET

STREET LODGINGS AND

CONGRATULATED HIM.

“Dr. JOHNSON,” THEY SAID, “WE

ARE DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT

YOU'VE NOT INCLUDED ANY INDECENT

OR OBSCENE WORDS IN YOUR

DICTIONARY.”

“LADIES,” SAID Dr. JOHNSON, “I

CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING ABLE

TO LOOK THEM UP.”

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues ANYONE

WHO CAN UNDERSTAND THAT JOKE,

AND I'M PLEASED TO SEE THAT

ABOUT 10 percent OF YOU CAN...

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues UM,

GETS THE POINT ABOUT CENSORSHIP,

ESPECIALLY PRIOR RESTRAINT, AS

IT'S KNOWN IN THE UNITED STATES,

WHERE IT'S BANNED BY THE FIRST

AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.

IT MAY NOT BE DETERMINED IN

ADVANCE WHAT WORDS ARE APT OR

INAPT.

NO ONE HAS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THAT

CALL

AND,

MORE TO THE

POINT, ONE HAS TO SUSPECT THE

MOTIVES OF THOSE WHO DO SO--

IN PARTICULAR, THE MOTIVES OF

THOSE WHO ARE DETERMINED TO BE

OFFENDED; OF THOSE WHO WILL GO

THROUGH A TREASURE HOUSE OF

ENGLISH, LIKE Dr. JOHNSON'S

FIRST LEXICON, IN SEARCH OF

FILTHY WORDS TO SATISFY

THEMSELVES AND SOME INSTINCT

ABOUT WHICH I DARE NOT

SPECULATE.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues NOW I

AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT THE

MAIN SOURCE OF HATRED IN THE

WORLD IS RELIGION.

AND ORGANIZED RELIGION.

ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF THEM.

  

\[Applause\]

  

Christopher continues AND I'M

GLAD THAT YOU APPLAUD BECAUSE

IT'S A VERY GREAT PROBLEM FOR

THOSE WHO OPPOSE THIS MOTION,

ISN'T IT?

HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BAN

RELIGION?

HOW ARE THEY GOING TO STOP THE

EXPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS

LOATHING, HATRED, AND BIGOTRY?

I SPEAK OF SOMEONE WHO'S A

FAIRLY REGULAR TARGET OF THIS,

AND NOT JUST IN RHETORICAL FORM.

I HAVE BEEN THE TARGET OF MANY

DEATH THREATS.

I KNOW IN, WITHIN THE SHORT

DISTANCE OF WHERE I'M CURRENTLY

LIVING IN WASHINGTON, I CAN NAME

TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES

YOU'D PROBABLY KNOW, WHO CAN'T

GO ANYWHERE NOW WITHOUT A

SECURITY DETAIL BECAUSE OF THE

CRITICISMS THEY'VE MADE OF ONE

MONOTHEISM IN PARTICULAR.

THIS IS IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF

THE UNITED STATES.

SO I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

AND I ALSO HAVE TO NOTICE THAT

THE SORT OF PEOPLE WHO RING ME

UP AND SAY THEY KNOW WHERE MY

CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL--

AND THEY CERTAINLY KNOW WHAT MY

HOME NUMBER IS, AND WHERE I

LIVE, AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

DO TO THEM AND TO MY WIFE AND TO

ME, AND WHO I HAVE TO TAKE

SERIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE

IT TO PEOPLE I KNOW--

ARE JUST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

GOING TO SEEK THE PROTECTION OF

THE HATE SPEECH LAW IF I SAY

WHAT I THINK ABOUT THEIR

RELIGION, WHICH I'M NOW GOING TO DO.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues

BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY, WHAT

YOU MIGHT CALL, ETHNIC BIAS.

I'VE NO GRUDGE OF THAT SORT.

I CAN RUB ALONG WITH PRETTY MUCH

ANYONE OF ANY, AS IT WERE,

ORIGIN OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, OR

LANGUAGE GROUP, EXCEPT PEOPLE

FROM YORKSHIRE, OF COURSE.

UM...

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues WHO ARE

COMPLETELY UNTAKEABLE.

  

\[Audience laughter\]

  

Christopher continues UM...

AND I'M BEGINNING TO RESENT THE

CONFUSION THAT'S BEING IMPOSED

ON US NOW, AND THERE WAS SOME OF

IT THIS EVENING BETWEEN, UH,

RELIGIOUS BELIEF, BLASPHEMY,

ETHNICITY, PROFANITY, AND WHAT

ONE MIGHT CALL MULTICULTURAL

ETIQUETTE.

IT'S QUITE COMMON NOW FOR PEOPLE

TO USE THE EXPRESSION, FOR

EXAMPLE, “ANTI-ISLAMIC RACISM.”

AS IF AN ATTACK ON A RELIGION

WASN'T AN ATTACK ON AN ETHNIC

GROUP.

THE WORD “ISLAMOPHOBIA,” IN

FACT, IS BEGINNING TO ACQUIRE

THE OPPROBRIUM OF THE--

THAT WAS ONCE RESERVED FOR

RACIAL PREJUDICE.

THIS IS A SUBTLE AND VERY NASTY

INSINUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE MET

HEAD-ON.

WHO SAID, “WHAT IF FALWELL SAYS

HE HATES FAGS?

WHAT IF PEOPLE ACT UPON THAT?”

THE BIBLE SAYS YOU HAVE TO HATE

FAGS.

IF FALWELL SAYS HE'S SAYING IT

'CAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS SO, HE'S

RIGHT.

YES, IT MIGHT MAKE PEOPLE GO OUT

AND USE VIOLENCE.

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT THAT?

YOU'RE UP AGAINST A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO

WILL SAY, “YOU--

DON'T YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON OUR

BIBLE OR WE'LL CALL THE HATE

SPEECH POLICE!”

NOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN

YOU'VE DUG THAT TRAP FOR YOURSELF?

SOMEBODY SAID THAT ANTI-SEMITISM

AND KRISTALLNACHT IN GERMANY WAS

THE RESULT OF TEN YEARS OF

JEW-BAITING.

TEN YEARS?!

YOU MUST BE JOKING.

IT'S THOSE OUT OF 2,000 YEARS OF

CHRISTIANITY, BASED ON ONE VERSE

OF ONE CHAPTER OF St. JOHN'S

GOSPEL, WHICH LED TO A POGROM

AFTER EVERY EASTER SERMON EVERY

YEAR FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS,

BECAUSE IT CLAIMS THAT THE JEWS

DEMANDED THE BLOOD OF CHRIST

BEYOND THE HEADS OF THEMSELVES

AND ALL THEIR CHILDREN TO THE

REMOTEST GENERATION.

THAT'S THE WARRANT AND LICENCE

FOR AND INCITEMENT TO

ANTI-JEWISH POGROMS.

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT

THAT; WHERE'S YOUR PIDDLING

SUBSECTION NOW?

DOES IT SAY St. JOHN'S GOSPEL

MUST BE CENSORED?

DO I WHO HAVE READ FREUD AND

KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE OF AN

ILLUSION REALLY IS, AND KNOW

THAT RELIGIOUS BELIEF IS

INERADICABLE AS LONG AS WE

REMAIN AS STUPID, POLY-EVOLVED

MAMMALIAN SPECIES, THINK THAT

SOME CANADIAN LAW IS GONNA SOLVE

THIS PROBLEM?

PLEASE.

NO, OUR PROBLEM IS THIS--

OUR PRE-FRONTAL LOBES ARE TOO

SMALL, AND OUR ADRENALINE GLANDS

ARE TOO BIG, AND OUR

THUMB-FINGER OPPOSITION ISN'T

ALL THAT IT MIGHT BE.

AND WE'RE AFRAID OF THE DARK,

AND WE'RE AFRAID TO DIE, AND WE

BELIEVE IN THE TRUTHS OF HOLY

BOOKS THAT ARE SO STUPID AND SO

FABRICATED THAT A CHILD CAN--

AND ALL CHILDREN DO--

BUT AS YOU CAN TELL BY THEIR

QUESTIONS, ACTUALLY SEE THROUGH

THEM.

AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE,

WRITTEN RELIGION TREATED WITH

RIDICULE--

  

Interjection: BRAVO!

  

Christopher says AND

HATRED, AND CONTEMPT!

  

\[Some applause\]

  

Christopher continues AND I

CLAIM THAT RIGHT.

NOW LET'S NOT DANCE AROUND; NOT

ALL MONOTHEISMS ARE EXACTLY THE

SAME AT THE MOMENT, BUT ALL

BASED ON THE SAME ILLUSION--

THEY'RE ALL PLAGIARISMS OF EACH

OTHER--

BUT THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR

THAT, AT THE MOMENT, IS

PROPOSING A SERIOUS MENACE NOT

JUST TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, BUT TO

QUITE A LOT OF OTHER FREEDOMS,

TOO.

AND THIS IS THE RELIGION THAT

EXHIBITS THE HORRIBLE TRIO OF

SELF-HATRED, SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS,

AND SELF-PITY.

I'M TALKING ABOUT MILITANT

ISLAM.

GLOBALLY, IT'S A GIGANTIC POWER.

GLOBALLY, IT'S A GIGANTIC POWER.

IT CONTROLS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

OF OIL WEALTH.

SEVERAL LARGE COUNTRIES AND

STATES WITH AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE,

IT'S PUMPING THE IDEOLOGY OF

WAHHABISM AND SALAFISM AROUND

THE WORLD, POISONING SOCIETIES

WHERE IT GOES, RUINING THE MINDS

OF CHILDREN, STULTIFYING THE

YOUNG IN ITS MUD TROUSERS,

TRAINING PEOPLE IN VIOLENCE,

MAKING A CULT OF DEATH AND

SUICIDE AND MURDER.

THAT'S WHAT IT DOES GLOBALLY,

IT'S QUITE STRONG.

IN OUR SOCIETIES, IT POSES AS A

CRINGING MINORITY, WHOSE FAITH

YOU MIGHT OFFEND, WHICH DESERVES

ALL THE PROTECTION THAT A SMALL

AND VULNERABLE GROUP MIGHT NEED.

NOW, IT MAKES QUITE LARGE CLAIMS

FOR ITSELF.

DOESN'T IT?

IT SAYS IT'S THE FINAL

REVELATION.

IT SAYS THAT GOD SPOKE TO ONE

ILLITERATE BUSINESSMAN IN THE

ARABIAN PENINSULA THREE TIMES

THROUGH AN ARCHANGEL, AND THAT

THE RESULTING MATERIAL WHICH, AS

YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOU READ IT, IS

LARGELY PLAGIARIZED FROM THE OLD

AND THE NEW TESTAMENT...

ALMOST ALL OF IT, ACTUALLY,

PLAGIARIZED INEPTLY FROM THE OLD

AND NEW TESTAMENT.

IT'S TO BE ACCEPTED AS A DIVINE

REVELATION AND AS THE FINAL AND

UNALTERABLE ONE, AND THAT THOSE

WHO DO NOT ACCEPT THIS

REVELATION ARE FIT TO BE TREATED

AS CATTLE, INFIDELS, POTENTIAL

CHATTEL SLAVES AND VICTIMS.

WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT, I DON'T

THINK MUHAMMAD EVER HEARD THOSE

VOICES.

I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

NOW THE LIKELIHOOD THAT I'M

RIGHT AS OPPOSED TO THE

LIKELIHOOD THAT A SHEPHERD WHO

COULDN'T--

UH, BUSINESSMAN--

WHO COULDN'T READ HAD BITS OF

THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT

RE-DICTATED TO HIM BY AN

ARCHANGEL, I THINK PUTS ME MUCH

MORE NEAR THE POSITION OF BEING

OBJECTIVELY CORRECT.

BUT WHO IS THE ONE UNDER THREAT?

THE PERSON WHO PROMULGATES THIS

AND SAYS, “I'D BETTER LISTEN

BECAUSE IF I DON'T I'M IN

DANGER”?

OR ME, WHO SAYS, “NO, I THINK

THIS IS SO SILLY, YOU CAN EVEN

PUBLISH A CARTOON ABOUT IT.”

AND UP GO THE PLACARDS, AND UP

GO THE YELLS AND THE HOWLS AND

THE SCREAMS, “BEHEAD THOSE!”

THIS IS IN LONDON, THIS IS IN

TORONTO, THIS IS IN NEW YORK.

IT'S RIGHT IN OUR MIDST NOW.

“BEHEAD THOSE!

BEHEAD THOSE WHO CARTOON ISLAM!”

DO THEY GET ARRESTED FOR HATE SPEECH?

NO.

MIGHT I GET IN TROUBLE FOR

SAYING WHAT I'VE JUST SAID ABOUT

THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD?

YES, I MIGHT.

WHERE ARE YOUR PRIORITIES,

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN?

YOU'RE GIVING AWAY WHAT'S MOST

PRECIOUS IN YOUR OWN SOCIETY AND

YOU'RE GIVING IT AWAY WITHOUT A

FIGHT, AND YOU'RE EVEN PRAISING

THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DENY YOU

THE RIGHT TO RESIST IT.

SHAME ON YOU WHILE YOU DO THIS.

MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE TIME

YOU'VE GOT LEFT.

THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS.

NOW...

IF YOU LOOK ANYWHERE YOU LIKE--

BECAUSE WE'VE HAD INVOCATIONS OF

A RATHER DRIVELLING AND SICKLY

KIND TONIGHT IF OUR SYMPATHY,

WHAT ABOUT THE POOR FAGS?

WHAT ABOUT THE POOR JEWS, THE

WRETCHED WOMEN WHO CAN'T TAKE

THE ABUSE?

AND THE SLAVES AND THEIR

DESCENDANTS, AND THE TRIBES WHO

DIDN'T MAKE IT AND WERE TOLD

THAT THEIR LAND WAS FORFEIT.

LOOK ANYWHERE YOU LIKE FOR THE

WARRANT FOR SLAVERY, FOR THE

SUBJECTION OF WOMEN AS CHATTEL,

FOR THE BURNING AND FLOGGING OF

HOMOSEXUALS, FOR ETHNIC

CLEANSING, FOR ANTI-SEMITISM--

FOR ALL OF THIS, YOU LOOK NO

FURTHER THAN A FAMOUS BOOK

THAT'S ON EVERY PULPIT IN THIS

CITY AND IN EVERY SYNAGOGUE AND

IN EVERY MOSQUE.

AND THEN JUST SEE WHETHER YOU

CAN SQUARE THE FACT THAT THE

FORCE THAT IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF

HATRED IS ALSO THE MAIN CALLER

FOR CENSORSHIP.

AND WHEN YOU'VE REALIZED THAT

YOU'RE THEREFORE, THIS EVENING,

FACED WITH A GIGANTIC FALSE

ANTITHESIS, I HOPE THAT STILL

WON'T STOP YOU FROM GIVING THE

MOTION BEFORE YOU THE RESOUNDING

ENDORSEMENT THAT IT DESERVES.

THANKS AWFULLY.

NIGHT-NIGHT.

  

\[Applause\]

  

Christopher says STAY COOL.

  

The clip ends and Andrew reappears in the studio with a caption that reads “Andrew Moodie.”

  

He says IT IS OBVIOUS

THAT HITCHENS IS PROUD OF

DEFENDING HOLOCAUST DENIER DAVID

IRVING AND THE CORE OF THE

ARGUMENT IS, “HOW CAN I HAVE

FREE SPEECH IF I'M NOT ABLE TO

DEFEND THE SPEECH OF SOMEONE

SAYING SOMETHING THAT I HATE?”

HOWEVER, IT'S

ACTUALLY PRETTY EASY TO DEFEND

SPEECH OF SOMEONE IF THAT SPEECH

DOESN'T POSE AN IMMEDIATE REAL

THREAT TO YOU OR A PARTICULAR

GROUP THAT YOU'RE A PART OF.

WOULD HITCHENS CHANGE HIS MIND

IF SOMEONE--

LET'S JUST SAY, OH, I DON'T

KNOW, UM--

NOAM CHOMSKY?

WERE TO BEGIN TO PEN PAMPHLETS

INSINUATING THE NEED FOR POGROMS

ON FORMER TROTSKYISTS WHO

SUPPORT WAR ON TERROR?

PERHAPS ABSOLUTE FREEDOM OF

SPEECH IS FINE WITH THOSE WHO

ARE BLESSED WITH A GIFT OF THE

GAB AND AN ABILITY TO SHIELD

THEMSELVES WITH WORDS.

BUT THEN, NOT EVERYBODY FALLS

INTO THAT CATEGORY.

AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN THE

FRONT LINES OF--

OR, PERHAPS THE BACK ALLEYS--

OF FREE SPEECH, I'M AWARE THAT

MY POSITION COMES WITH CERTAIN

RESPONSIBILITIES.

FREE SPEECH IS NEVER A FREE

LUNCH.

IF YOU CROSS A CERTAIN LINE--

AND THE LINE CHANGES WITH THE

TIMES--

YOU PAY.

IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND WILL

ALWAYS BE THUS.

OH YES, UH, THE RESOLUTION

CALLING FOR THE

DECRIMINALIZATION OF HATE SPEECH

WAS UPHELD BY THE AUDIENCE

LISTENING TO THE ARGUMENTS OF

THE HART HOUSE DEBATING CLUB BY

205 TO 87 VOTES.

NEXT WEEK, IT'S THE BEGINNING OF

OUR 5-WEEK RUN OF THE 2007 BEST

LECTURER COMPETITION--

TEN ONTARIO PROFESSORS COMPETING

FOR YOUR VOTE.

YOU CAN SEE

WHO THEY ARE, AND STUDY OUR

VOTING PROCEDURE, ON OUR WEB

SITE AT

www.tvo.org/bestlecturer

AND NOW, SPEND A FEW MINUTES

WITH OUR JURY, WHOSE JOB WAS TO

SELECT THE TEN FINALISTS.

HERE ARE THE NOVELIST, CAMILLA GIBB,

MACLEAN'S MANAGING

EDITOR, TONY KELLER, AND

GLOBE AND MAIL'S

COLUMNIST, MARGARET WENTE,

GIVING US THEIR IDEAS ABOUT WHAT

MAKES A GREAT LECTURER.

  

Tony Keller, Camilla Gibb and Margaret Wente sit at a round table in front of a TV set.

Tony is in his forties, clean-shaven, with receding curly blond hair. He’s wearing a black suit and a pink shirt.

Camilla is in her late thirties, with long chestnut hair in a ponytail. She’s wearing a white blazer over a brown shirt.

Margaret is in her fifties, with short blond hair in a bob and bangs. She’s wearing a silver blazer.

  

A caption appears on screen. It reads "Tony Keller. Managing Editor, Maclean’s."

  

Tony says THERE IS THIS

NOTION THAT THE LECTURER'S

PASSE, THAT KIDS NEED--

ALL THEY NEED ARE AUDIO-VISUAL

AIDS, OH, THEY'RE ALL ON TEXT

MESSAGES, THEY'RE ALL ON CELL

PHONES...

THEY'RE ALL THAT--

THEY HAVE LOW ATTENTION SPAN,

AND THE IDEA OF SOMEONE STANDING

IN FRONT OF A CLASS FOR 30, 40,

50, 60 MINUTES AND TALKING JUST

DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE.

I DON'T BUY IT. UH...

I THINK THAT, IF ANYTHING, ONE

OF THESE THAT'S ESSENTIAL ABOUT

UNIVERSITY IS THAT IT NOT JUST

REVEAL TO YOU THINGS THAT YOU

HAVE NOT LEARNED BEFORE BUT IT

PROVIDE YOU WITH EXPERIENCES

THAT YOU HAVE NOT HAD BEFORE,

AND IT SEEMS TO BE ALL THE MORE

REASON THAT YOU WANT PEOPLE--

AS LONG AS THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT

IT--

TO STAND UP IN FRONT OF A CLASS

AND JUST SAY THERE ARE ALL THOSE

OTHER DISTRACTIONS; WE'RE GONNA

PUSH THEM ASIDE AND IT'S JUST MY

VOICE, MY IDEAS, AND YOU'RE

GOING TO HAVE TO FOCUS ON THESE

FOR 50 MINUTES.

MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING

THAT--

SOCRATIC METHOD, STRAIGHT

LECTURE...

BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S

REALLY IMPORTANT...

  

Camilla says BUT THERE IS--

  

Tony says TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

  

Camilla says THERE'S

PROBABLY MORE PRESSURE, I THINK,

NOW, ON UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS--

  

Tony says YES.

  

The caption changes to "Camilla Gibb. Novelist, ‘Sweetness in the belly.’"

  

Camilla says TO BE ADEPT

PERFORMERS AND TO BE ABLE TO

CAPTURE--

  

Tony says CAPTURE THEIR--

  

Camilla says THEIR

AUDIENCES IN A WAY THAT...

WELL, CERTAINLY, WHEN I WAS AN

UNDERGRADUATE, THERE WASN'T THAT

SORT OF ONUS, AND THERE WASN'T

THIS IDEA THAT YOU WERE

COMPETING WITH OTHER FORMS OF

INFORMATION DELIVERY.

  

Tony says YEAH.

AND COMPETING WITH THEM NOT JUST

IN SOME BROAD SENSE OUTSIDE THE

CLASSROOM, BUT COMPETING WITH

THEM DIRECTLY IN THE CLASSROOM

AND THAT, IN MANY CLASSROOMS,

EVERYONE'S GOT A LAPTOP, AND

THEY'RE DOING THINGS ON THEIR

LAPTOP THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO

THE LECTURE.

  

Camilla says MM-HMM.

  

The caption changes to "Margaret Wente. Columnist, ‘The Globe and Mail.’"

  

Margaret says BUT TONY, I

THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF

THIS, ON TEACHING--

  

Tony says YES!

  

Margaret says AND

LECTURING.

  

Tony says ABSOLUTELY!

  

Margaret says NOT ON--

NOT THE KIND OF LECTURING WHERE

YOU'RE BASICALLY TEACHING

CHAPTER 2.

OR TEACHING THE TEXTBOOK.

  

Tony says EXACTLY.

  

Margaret says BUT THE KIND

OF LECTURE IN WHERE YOU'RE

ADDING A LOT OF VALUE THROUGH

INSIGHT OR SYNTHESIS...

  

Tony says YEAH.

  

Margaret says OR, UH...

OR THE COMMUNICATION OF BIG

IDEAS.

AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING

THAT A TEXTBOOK CANNOT DO.

A TEXTBOOK ALSO CAN'T TEACH YOU

OR SHOW YOU HOW TO THINK.

  

Tony says YEAH.

  

Margaret says AND THE BEST

OF THESE LECTURERS ARE SHOWING

YOU HOW TO THINK BECAUSE THEY

ARE, IN A WAY, THINKING OUT

LOUD.

AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THEIR

ARGUMENT UNFOLDS.

  

Tony says YEAH.

I THINK, OFTEN, YOU KNOW,

THERE'S A TREMENDOUS PRESSURE IN

BUSINESS, AND I THINK NOW AS

WELL IN ACADEMIA, TO HAVE A

VISUAL THAT GOES ALONG WITH YOUR

LECTURE--

TO HAVE A POWERPOINT

PRESENTATION THAT GOES WITH YOUR

LECTURE.

AND I THINK, IN MOST CASES--

NOT ALL, BUT IN MOST CASES--

THIS ACTUALLY DETRACT FROM THE

LECTURE BECAUSE SOMEONE FEELS A

NEED TO HYPER-SIMPLIFY WHAT THEY

HAVE TO SAY, TO PUT IT DOWN IN

FOUR WORDS, IN A SERIES OF

FOUR-WORD SLIDES, WHICH THEY

WILL THEN SORT OF REPEAT IN

THEIR WORDS AS THEY'RE

SPEAKING--

  

Margaret says I HATE

POWERPOINT.

  

Tony says REPEAT THE

WORDS--

YEAH, THEY'RE REPEAT THE WORDS

THAT ARE UP ON THE SCREEN, IT'S

CRAZY!

  

Margaret says I HATE

POWERPOINT BECAUSE POWERPOINT

SIMPLIFIES.

  

Tony says YEAH!

  

Margaret says AND

UNIVERSITY SHOULD BE ABOUT

COMPLEXITY.

IT SHOULD BE ABOUT NUANCE.

IT SHOULD BE ABOUT STRUGGLING

WITH INTERESTING AND DIFFICULT,

AND CHALLENGING IDEAS.

  

Camilla says NOT ON KEY

MESSAGES.

  

Tony says YEAH.

  

Margaret says NO.

  

Camilla says YOU KNOW, IT

DOES GET VERY--

  

Margaret says IT'S NOT

ADVERTISING.

  

Tony says THERE WAS THIS

GREAT JOKE THAT WAS GOING AROUND

THE INTERNET, I DON'T KNOW IF IT

WAS A YEAR OR TWO AGO, AND IT

WAS THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS

REDUCED TO POWERPOINT.

  

Margaret Laughs.

  

Tony says AND THE

ABSURDITY OF TAKING THE BEAUTY

OF LANGUAGE AND SUCH COMPLEX AND

EXPANSIVE THOUGHTS, AND REDUCING

THEM TO A SERIES OF FIVE-WORD

PHRASES.

AND...

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO NOT

WANT PEOPLE TO BE EXPOSED TO AT

UNIVERSITY BECAUSE THERE'S SO

MUCH OF THAT ALREADY IN THE

WORLD.

YOU WANT THE OPPOSITE AT

UNIVERSITY.

  

The clip ends.

  

Andrew says COME BACK NEXT

WEEK AND PARTICIPATE IN THE BEST

LECTURER COMPETITION.

FOR

BIG IDEAS,

I'M ANDREW

MOODIE.
