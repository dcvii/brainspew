[How does an adult deal with someone else's children who continue to kick their football into one's property?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-an-adult-deal-with-someone-elses-children-who-continue-to-kick-their-football-into-ones-property)

There is a recently published university study that shows football leads to increased aggression. Every time you touch a football, receptors in your fingers sense the pebbling on the skin and raises your testosterone level. They recommend that women who are nursing or pregnant never touch footballs, so if you are a woman, you should leave the football wherever it lands and stay away.

Our recent neighborhood council had a town hall meeting about this very subject when a woman miscarried after throwing several footballs back over her fence. We passed a new ordinance on fencing, and placed warning placards in the parks and schools. Of course an exception was granted for the three high school players who didn't test positively male. (We were 7-1 that season).

Just kidding. Here's what I would do. If you don't want the kids in your yard, then it's going to cost you money. Buy several used footballs. Every time you get one of their balls, throw a different one back. Make sure you throw a cheaper, smaller one back until you get all the way down to Nerf mini, then a little pink plastic one that fits in your pocket.

The smaller they are, the less likely they are to fly over the fence or hurt anything. Once they get down to the tiny one they will have to involve their parents to get the real football back. Then you give them all of the footballs back.

If they keep causing trouble or don't get the joke. Call the cops and show them receipts for your stolen footballs.

You, sir, are hilarious. You've gained a follower with this answer. I'd love to see the looks on the kid's faces when the ball thrown back is different. ROFL. A little pink Nerf!?

I do agree with the tolerance answers, but yours has me laughing out loud.

But first, deflate all the balls.
