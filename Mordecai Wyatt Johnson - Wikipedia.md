Mordecai Johnson, president of Howard University, serving portions of Thanksgiving turkey to members of his family in 1942.

**Mordecai Wyatt Johnson** (January 4, 1890 – September 10, 1976) was an American educator and pastor. He served as the first African-American president of [Howard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University "Howard University"), from 1926 until 1960. Johnson has been considered one of the three leading African-American preachers of the early 20th-century, along with [Vernon Johns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Johns "Vernon Johns") and [Howard Thurman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Thurman "Howard Thurman").

## Early life

Johnson was born on January 12, 1890, in [Paris, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris,_Tennessee "Paris, Tennessee"), to parents who were former slaves. His father was Reverend Wyatt J. Johnson, a preacher and mill worker. His mother, Carolyn Freeman, was a domestic worker for one of the prominent families in town.[^1]

## Education

Johnson attended a small elementary school in his native town. Afterward, he moved to [Nashville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville "Nashville"), where he studied at [Roger Williams University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Williams_University_\(Nashville,_Tennessee\) "Roger Williams University (Nashville, Tennessee)"). Later he studied at Howe Institute in Memphis.

He transferred to the Atlanta Baptist College (now [Morehouse College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morehouse_College "Morehouse College"), a [historically black college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_college "Historically black college")), where he completed his secondary and undergraduate education. During his college career, he was a member of the debating team and the [Glee Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_Club "Glee Club"), a star athlete in three sports, and [quarterback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback "Quarterback") of the football team. Offered a faculty position at the college upon graduation, he taught [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_studies "English studies") and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") and served a year as acting dean. He maintained a profound interest in economics throughout his career, an interest that was apparent in some of his major speeches.

After one year of teaching, he continued his education at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago"), where he received a second A.B. degree, and at the [Rochester Theological Seminary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Theological_Seminary "Rochester Theological Seminary") in [Rochester, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York "Rochester, New York"), where he earned the B.D. degree. At Rochester he was profoundly influenced by the great "social gospel" advocate, [Walter Rauschenbusch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rauschenbusch "Walter Rauschenbusch"). His experiences there strongly influenced his thinking and his entire career. He also earned a Doctor of Divinity degree at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") in 1923.[^2]

## Family

Johnson married Anna Ethelyn Gardner on December 25, 1916. They had five children: Carolyn Elizabeth Johnson, Mordecai Wyatt Johnson Jr., Archer Clement Johnson, William Howard Johnson, and [Anna Faith Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Faith_Johnson_Jones "Anna Faith Johnson Jones").

Johnson brought Howard University into national prominence and served as president of Howard for 34 years, since 1926 until his retirement in 1960. In this time the enrollment at Howard University increased from 2,000 in 1926 to more than 10,000 in 1960.

In 1929, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ([NAACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP "NAACP")) awarded Johnson the [Spingarn Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spingarn_Medal "Spingarn Medal") (its highest honor at that time), for Johnson's ability to secure annual [federal funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds "Federal funds") to support the university's financial future.[^5]
