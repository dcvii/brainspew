I built 30+ AI agents for real businesses - Here's the truth nobody talks about

So I've spent the last 18 months building custom AI agents for businesses from startups to mid-size companies, and I'm seeing a TON of misinformation out there. Let's cut through the BS.

First off, those YouTube gurus promising you'll make $50k/month with AI agents after taking their $997 course? They're full of shit. Building useful AI agents that businesses will actually pay for is both easier AND harder than they make it sound.

What actually works (from someone who's done it)

Most businesses don't need fancy, complex AI systems. They need simple, reliable automation that solves ONE specific pain point really well. The best AI agents I've built were dead simple but solved real problems:

- A real estate agency where I built an agent that auto-processes property listings and generates descriptions that converted 3x better than their templates
- A content company where my agent scrapes trending topics and creates first-draft outlines (saving them 8+ hours weekly)
- A SaaS startup where the agent handles 70% of customer support tickets without human intervention

These weren't crazy complex. They just worked consistently and saved real time/money.

The uncomfortable truth about AI agents

Here's what those courses won't tell you:

1. Building the agent is only 30% of the battle. Deployment, maintenance, and keeping up with API changes will consume most of your time.
2. Companies don't care about "AI" - they care about ROI. If you can't articulate exactly how your agent saves money or makes money, you'll fail.
3. The technical part is actually getting easier (thanks to better tools), but identifying the right business problems to solve is getting harder.

I've had clients say no to amazing tech because it didn't solve their actual pain points. And I've seen basic agents generate $10k+ in monthly value by targeting exactly the right workflow.

How to get started if you're serious

If you want to build AI agents that people actually pay for:

1. Start by solving YOUR problems first. Build 3-5 agents for your own workflow. This forces you to create something genuinely useful.
2. Then offer to build something FREE for 3 local businesses. Don't be fancy - just solve one clear problem. Get testimonials.
3. Focus on results, not tech. "This saved us 15 hours weekly" beats "This uses GPT-4 with vector database retrieval" every time.
4. Document everything. Your hits AND misses. The pattern-recognition will become your edge.

The demand for custom AI agents is exploding right now, but most of what's being built is garbage because it's optimized for flashiness, not results.

What's been your experience with AI agents? Anyone else building them for businesses or using them in your workflow?

The number of humans in the loop of the automation can be reduced down to 0 or very few, because the class of problems that is now solvable was previously considered to be very human only.
> > > 
> > > The challenge is that the end customer needs to understand there is still limitations to the performance and accuracy. If they are in a percentage game anyway, they might be fine with this (improving sales lead conversions from 10% to 30% is awesome. Even if errors are made, the impact is great). Situations like this you can see if the human or the agent does a better job in different circumstances and just optimise.

To them, all tasks look equally difficult and they also don’t understand the dependency on the quality of their own information and data and processes.
> > > 
> > > So if you were getting automated five years ago, you would be in a much better position to expand that automation, because you would view AI agents as an expansion of your existing class of problems solved through automation. But the majority of these customers have in-house teams end up, probably trying to do it themselves. Matching up external expertise with their internal already built automations and systems is quite difficult because there’s not much standardisation.

Now I made a Saas with 8 agents which spawned a separate ai companion app. So many ideas...so little time.

That’s how I got confident enough to try other ideas. Besides, have you tried getting feedback early, like maybe using platforms like Product Hunt? It helped me gauge interest and refine my projects quickly. Also, tools like Dialogflow and Wit can be awesome to experiment with if you're diving into AI bots. Pulse for Reddit is cool too for automating Reddit engagement if you’re looking to expand into social platforms.
