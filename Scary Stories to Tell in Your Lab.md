There have been four brain tumors in our department in roughly the past twelve years. Maybe five? Is that too many brain tumors? Not enough brain tumors? Just the right amount of brain tumors? It kind of seems like a lot. I would like to think math could probably tell us if it is. But I don’t have the time. And, even if I did, I don’t really know where I’d start or if I could even access the data I’d need to begin. Hence, without such formal epidemiological calculations, those of us in my department that have come to partake in this beloved departmental pastime are left like a pair of Brewster sisters on Halloween trying to figure out how many gentlemen they’ve got in the basement.

This is more or less what I was telling my undergrad a few years back as we transported a cart of soiled rodent cages in a slow moving freight elevator that looked like the kind of place Jigsaw, along with his buddy, Billy the Puppet, might want to rent out for their next round of mischief in *Saw 27: Keep On Sawing*. My undergrad had been complaining about how the bio building at our university seemed somewhat less impressive than the one that housed the business school on the other side of campus. That building didn’t have scary murder elevators that seemed destined to get stuck or drinking fountains that had warnings posted on them regarding excessive amounts of lead in the water. Something else it probably didn’t have was four or five brain tumors in roughly the past twelve years (roughly nine years at the time), which, as I was telling my undergrad, seemed more troubling than scary murder elevators and excessive amounts of lead in the water.

***Not Entirely Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction?***

Having spent way too much of my adult life in different research-based graduate programs, I’ve sort of come to believe the buildings and departments that house such programs all have their ghost stories. At any given time, each has at least a few young scientists-in-training who swear that while working in their lab late one night they encountered the science building’s resident poltergeist who apparently spends its days hanging out with the rats inside the walls and its nights making spooky noises to distract nocturnal researchers who have less exciting personal lives than even the poor poltergeist.

Moreover, I get the impression many departments have what should be objectively more frightening stories like the one about the biology building that had four brain tumors (maybe five) in the span of roughly twelve years.

At another institution, for instance, there were stories told at departmental happy hours held in dimly lit townie bars about a MRSA lab run by an old tenured professor from the Orient whose attitude towards lab safety was that if you work with MRSA, you’re going to get a MRSA infection at some point, and, rather than waste valuable lab time and resources trying to prevent the inevitable, the best thing to do is stay productive and hope the inevitable doesn’t end up on your face like it did with that one guy.

More broadly, it seems that if you speak to practically anyone who has ever worked for an extended period in a lab in which ethidium bromide was regularly utilized for running electrophoresis gels, it is likely they have a story or two of careless splashes and poorly cleaned spills – or perhaps a colleague who never wore gloves when handling the stuff despite constant warnings that even the tiniest drop on your skin would inevitably transform you into a tumorous creature from Cronenberg.

Granted, there is a contingent of ethidium bromide truthers online with advanced degrees in relevant fields who [argue](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/myth-ethidium-bromide) the dangers of ethidium bromide are little more than urban legend – and perhaps they’re right. However, something tells me its routine questionable handling, generally, is less a matter of well-informed experts taking calculated risks and more one of casual indifference to a distant threat or disposable graduate students and undergrads knowing a lost day of work and angry advisor are far scarier than anything ethidium bromide might do to them.

From those who consider themselves to be more outside-scientists, especially those who do their work in more exotic locales, equivalent stories, usually told with a note of good cheer or a self-deprecating laugh, revolve around month-long bouts of diarrhea, the need for a z-pack upon returning home, persistent fungal infections, and interactive lessons in some of the animal kingdom’s multifarious mechanisms of defense. One of the more interesting stories I’ve happened upon comes from a young woman who had millipede poison sprayed in her eyes by a millipede that was apparently just not that into her, although I failed to ask whether the poison got her high like the lemurs in that [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYXoCHLqr4o).

Also, in a bizarre fusion of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant approach to safety, field research, and DEI, I have also had interactions with outside-scientists who have indicated there are certain safety questions deemed, in some circles, to be taboo due to their potential to cause offense.

For example, should an attractive American woman in her early twenties have concerns about doing field work alone in a predominantly Muslim country with different attitudes towards women’s rights than those to which she might be accustomed? Even entertaining the possibility is both sexist and racist!

Is there a greater risk of contracting plague in Madagascar than the US? Even acknowledging the occasional [outbreak](https://www.science.org/content/article/deadly-plague-epidemic-rages-madagascar) of Black Death in Madagascar is racist and classist! Plus, once per year or so we have a guy who gets a little too close to a [plague squirrel](https://abcnews.go.com/US/squirrel-tests-positive-bubonic-plague-colorado/story?id=71769840) and we did have that [UChicago microbiologist](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6007a1.htm) who treated *Yersinia* like it was harmless ethidium bromide – so we have it too!

Yet, are the kinds of stories reported above the exceptions when it comes to working in your typical academic research environment? Or are they representative of near ubiquitous experiences?

Once when [attending](https://www.thecollegefix.com/that-time-i-attended-a-dei-seminar-with-one-of-the-folx-working-to-reimagine-stem/) a strongly-encouraged-but-then-not-yet-quite-mandatory departmental seminar, the speaker half-jokingly referenced the seemingly archetypal experience of being told to stand on a wobbly chair to fetch a highly corrosive acid off a tall shelf and the entire room seemed to be able to relate.

While talking with doctor friends and scientist colleagues about a particular scene in *Alien: Earth* – a scene in which a young researcher engaged in astrobiological specimen husbandry accidentally breaks the handle off the feeding door for a cage of alien flies, subsequently enters the alien fly cage to provide them their food, gets spooked by the sheep with the highly intelligent octo-eye in the adjacent cage, accidentally locks himself in the alien fly cage, then ends up feeding the alien flies in a manner somewhat different than intended – we seem to agree this was one of the series’ most realistic scenes.

But still, how well half-jokes and fictional depictions resonate does not answer the aforementioned questions. And, unfortunately, those who have tried to investigate this more thoroughly have encountered difficulties.

As [pointed out](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337358227_A_review_and_critique_of_academic_lab_safety_research) in a 2019 review, research on the safety of academic labs is limited. High quality research on the topic is even more scarce. (Also, notably, the review did not touch on field research or larger, potential, building-wide problems like something maybe causing four or five brain tumors in the span of roughly twelve years).

Based on the research that was available, though, it would appear most researchers somewhat paradoxically see their labs as safe despite a notable minority of 15-30% reporting that they have been involved in, or at least witnessed, a lab accident they perceived as warranting medical attention.

Additionally, according to the review, there is reason to suspect “close calls” are underreported and that some notable fraction of the scientific community may simply see scientific research as an endeavor that is inherently unsafe, or potentially detrimental to one’s long-term health, perhaps resulting in attitudes like if you work with MRSA, you’re going to get a MRSA infection at some point.

As for improving lab safety, the review’s authors argued such efforts are most definitely warranted, but largely concluded more research is needed to determine what interventions or policies might actually be effective in changing not just attitudes, but also relevant behaviors, while also providing a meaningful benefit to those such efforts would be intended to protect.

That said, I am also aware such efforts can lead to a bureaucratic circle of Hell that even Dante couldn’t imagine while driving up the cost of research and providing few if any real benefits to anyone. (Proposals of requiring goggles just to set foot into a lab, even when alone, and prohibitions on being in a lab without a non-poltergeist companion come to mind).

Personally, I’d probably support some middle-ground allowing for a certain amount of risk. However, I also would argue that an important starting-point is that informed consent is necessary and that this probably requires greater effort on the part of PIs than simply ensuring their students annually attend an overly broad, mandatory, departmental safety meeting, then telling them that if they have any additional questions they can consult either Professor Google or a Byzantine chemical manual that no one has ever read and that no one ever will.

Additionally, I would argue that there needs to be better ways for separating departmental ghost stories from meaningful risks.

***The Case of the Four (or Maybe Five) Tumorous Brains***

Returning to the matter of the four (or maybe five) brain tumors that occurred in my department in a span of roughly twelve years, this past spring I picked up my pipe, put on my tweed deerstalker hat, and decided to embark on a bit of amateur sleuthing.

From talking with people who had been around my department for quite some time, what I learned was that people in the department have been casually calculating the number of brain tumors in the department since there were only two (or maybe three) brain tumors back in the the early 2010s.

It was around that time that two individuals in the department died with brain tumors. Whether both died of brain tumors is unknown. One was said to have worked with some dangerous chemicals and may not have always worn proper PPE. One was said, in polite terms, to have long had a reputation for being a little off with the suggestion being they may have had something impacting their executive functioning well before they even first entered our eldritch building. The deaths were separated by less than a year. Those who were around back then say people tended to think of it as an unfortunate coincidence, although an admittedly unsettling one that was made even more admittedly unsettling by rumors of another brain tumor in the department some time prior to that, although no one still around seems to know when that actually was.

Then for nearly a decade, the department was brain tumor-free until there were two more, again within a year of one another. Thus, the total became four or five. Four within a twelve year period (actually nine if one measures from the first known brain tumor to the last). Five within...a thirteen year period? A twenty year period? A twenty-five year period? Or maybe there never was a fifth one at all.

But even if there were only four brain tumors in a twelve year period (or, more precisely, a nine year period), is that too many brain tumors? Not enough brain tumors? Just the right amount of brain tumors? It kind of seems like a lot. But it’s not like the five (or maybe ten) [nurses](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/newton-wellesley-hospital-nurses-brain-cancer-cases/) at that hospital in Massachusetts that supposedly all developed brain tumors within a few years. Right? Plus, there arguably were factors that complicate the earlier confirmed ones.

In any case, I was eventually directed to one of our university’s safety officers, who I assumed would be in a better position to sort this all out or perhaps had some record of how many brain tumors the department actually had, when they occurred, and whether the university ever actually looked into things like did someone have some improperly stored plutonium somewhere or was the building built on an ancient Indian burial ground.

However, what I soon found myself confronted with was, well, a bureaucratic circle of Hell that Dante may not have been able to imagine but that Joseph Heller surely did.

What I learned was that although the university does not have specific criteria for initiating an investigation into the kinds of health and safety concerns about which I was concerned, the university does investigate concerns deemed both credible and specific. However, the criteria for meeting the definitions of credible and specific were unspecified and the entire process of initiating an investigation is perhaps complicated by the fact that the university does not (or legally cannot) formally collect the kind of data that could provide credible or specific evidence for the initiation of an investigation into something like a cluster of brain tumor cases. Additionally, informal tallies, even if credible and specific, are not sufficient to spur an investigation.

In more Hellerian terms, the university will not investigate certain types of health and safety claims without the kind of evidence they do not and maybe cannot collect.

In fairness, the Hellerian version of this is perhaps a bit oversimplified. Also, I have been told the reason the university cannot collect the kind of data about which I am writing is that doing so would be a violation of HIPAA (which is something I can appreciate as someone who does not want my academic institution prying into my medical records, but something I also question given that the university pried into people’s medical records all throughout COVID and continues to do so by ensuring incoming students are up to date on their tetanus boosters).

Furthermore, from what I have been told both on the record and off the record when talking to epidemiologists and public health physicians when [writing](https://www.thecollegefix.com/lawmakers-propose-spending-180m-to-gut-ncsu-building-linked-to-cancer-causing-agents/) about cancer cases with alleged links to particular buildings elsewhere, even when such matters are investigated properly, establishing such links is a notoriously difficult task.

Hence, it would appear that, even as my department proudly updates the sign outside to read “3 YEARS WITHOUT A BRAIN TUMOR”, those who have passed through its darkened halls will be left wondering about those brain tumors – not to mention our resident science-building poltergeist.
