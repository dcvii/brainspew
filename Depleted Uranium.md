Suggested tl;dr.

Most people are not foolish enough to generously toss stupidly expensive, weapons-grade, nuclear bomb-making material at their enemies.

> Why is depleted uranium rather than enriched uranium used in armor piercing bullets and shells?

The kinetic energy of a projectile is roughly given by 12mv2.

So, it seems like if you want a more destructive projectile, you just want more speed. If you double velocity, the destructive energy quadruples.

We see this in space. Where a teeny-tiny object moving very fast can cause ridiculously disproportionate destruction.

At 15,000 mph, a small piece of simulated debris, the size of a tiny pebble caused this 5-inch deep cavity.

But, we live on Earth. And we have this inconvenient, soupy stuff all around us we call “air”. And the faster you go, the more “solid” it feels. If you fire a projectile in the atmosphere, air resistance is constantly bleeding away all the energy you put into that projectile. And the faster you’re going, the faster you’re losing energy.

The more energy you need? Well. The more powder it takes to fire that projectile. And if you want a lot of energy… well… engineering has its limits. Even the weapon itself must obey the laws of physics.

Metallurgy and machining doesn’t allow for infinitely high pressures needed to fire a projectile at any speed. There is a speed limit. Er, speed limits—driven by different components and physical constraints.

So, there's a practical limit on v? What's left to fiddle with?

m.

So, if you reach the practical speed limit, and you want to deliver more energy to your target, you just need to make it heavier. Right? (Surely, there must be a mass limit too…)

Lead is heavy, right?

Well. Uranium is heavier. Heavier than lead. About 60% heavier.

“Hi! Did you order the bad day?”

> I know depleted is cheaper but would not enriched be more dead

Depleted Uranium-238 is already about 1% heavier than pure, enriched Uranium-235. The destructive power is from the mass alone. “Real” enriched Uranium isn’t pure. But, the mass difference just isn’t very much.

And you don't need the “fun” feature of enriched uranium at all—that its heavy a nucleus is unstable and can split. It’s not being used as a nuclear weapon. It’s just throwing a big rock. Just about seven times heavier than a normal rock.

Further, depleted uranium is far more plentiful. Enriched uranium is very expensive (and annoying and a bit dangerous) to obtain. Did I mention it’s expensive? It’s really expensive.

- 1 kg of enriched uranium is about $24,000.
- 1 kg of depleted uranium is about $140.

Huge difference. So, you really have a cost choice: do you want to spend the same amount of money and get 200 depleted uranium rounds, or do you want one enriched uranium round… that weights just ever-so slightly less… but which can be used for much better purposes because it's nuclear fuel? (e.g. replenishing a nuclear reactor, military or civilian).

And then the most obvious: most people are not foolish enough to generously toss stupidly expensive, weapons-grade, nuclear bomb-making material at their enemies.
