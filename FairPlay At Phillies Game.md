\[THREAD\] 🧵  
The Phillies game just turned into a whole metaphor for America. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237897466306561/pl/4DisvZDV5CPVXpXY.m3u8?v=dec&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237897466306561/vid/avc1/480x852/QJiuROFc9MRiviKf.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237897466306561/vid/avc1/1080x1920/kKfG6BO9FuKK3VPR.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237897466306561/vid/avc1/320x568/Q3ijuKQ2XNRsHR_V.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237897466306561/vid/avc1/720x1280/BVOyCOO8gST30wDk.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

1/ Dad catches a HR ball. Pure joy. He hands it to his little boy. Moment locked in forever. 👨👦 <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237994673463296/pl/NsDjsdlAEdtqHowI.m3u8?v=2b8&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237994673463296/vid/avc1/640x360/P-Sj_bUNjUbdtByX.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237994673463296/vid/avc1/480x270/W9airPVkkjQsHJrz.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237994673463296/vid/avc1/1920x1080/FOxZw4cVnDAAk9v9.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964237994673463296/vid/avc1/1280x720/SEtVMokNJ6qwFUq7.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

2/ Outta nowhere… a Karen shows up. Demands the ball like it’s hers. Loud. Pushy. Entitled. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238091947827200/pl/PGWeVvf1M8FLxIWQ.m3u8?v=f3a&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238091947827200/vid/avc1/480x852/NSL6hrmYaIF33MSp.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238091947827200/vid/avc1/720x1280/ZHqEXXKt-6FhAyRt.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238091947827200/vid/avc1/320x568/jbmPktaPG0lmZFUf.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238091947827200/vid/avc1/1080x1920/bMTxwJiubOzlKuMO.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

3/ Dad didn’t wanna scar his son—so he takes the ball back… and hands it over to the Karen. Protecting his kid from the drama. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238241218912257/pl/iM5JJLugMXLFVBQY.m3u8?v=cfc&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238241218912257/vid/avc1/1280x720/aJLB1BXlqb_KeL7S.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238241218912257/vid/avc1/640x360/mY0kEQJOYtFhQZtt.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238241218912257/vid/avc1/480x270/vOfwGou-R9oLCOz0.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238241218912257/vid/avc1/1920x1080/cMBUjyINv5v3nLfy.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

4/ Internet lost its mind. Cameras caught it all. And here’s the twist… <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238396026486785/pl/MfSvdgyHmzaw5CGt.m3u8?v=cfc&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238396026486785/vid/avc1/720x810/mQlb0tqVMVyryAUy.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238396026486785/vid/avc1/1080x1216/2URPh-_mGbRkWMgj.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238396026486785/vid/avc1/480x540/jIMZ3j_-gpcuAcAh.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238396026486785/vid/avc1/320x360/LLf7kRPV3rQRDD3w.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

5/ The kid ends up walking away with MORE than just a ball. Signed bat. Extra gifts. Crowd on his side. Players too. 👏 <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238500217188352/pl/wFptrQG6aBM53ugr.m3u8?v=cfc&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238500217188352/vid/avc1/720x1280/YHMgYibIhPIksatt.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238500217188352/vid/avc1/320x568/HOy22EI3LDaEI3j1.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238500217188352/vid/avc1/480x852/1UVCCWmnuT6qd2KJ.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1964238500217188352/vid/avc1/1080x1920/Kg74g3S_KY8hgdkQ.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

6/ Secret drop? 👀 Sometimes evil has to expose itself publicly… just so the whole world can see the difference between stealing joy and spreading it.  

7/ This wasn’t about baseball. It was about America.  
– Some people will rob a child’s smile.  
– Others will fight to give it back 100x stronger.

8/ So the question is… what team are we really on?

🚨 Was Leonardo da Vinci hiding aliens in plain sight?  
  
This painting is called “The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.  
But in secret… many call it “The Hidden Code.

(1/)  
Da Vinci was known for slipping secret symbols into his work.  
But here’s the weird part: put a mirror over half the painting… and a strange face appears. Almost like a grey alien.

3\. So the question is:  
Was Da Vinci actually hinting at something he saw?  
Or was he just playing mind games with us, 500 years later?

Respectfully, Anthony, but you’re comparing flipping pancakes in uni to the minimum wage chaos your government created.  
Penalty rates matter — sure. But what about rent inflation, grocery prices, and utility hikes that outpaced every penalty bump?  
  
People aren’t asking for nostalgia.  
They’re asking how to survive 2025, not 1995.  
  
Are you ready to match wages to real life costs — or just keep tweeting retro memories?

2.  
Every woman who uploaded a selfie or driver’s license to prove they’re “real” on Tea?  
  
Congrats. You’re now part of a worldwide doxxing database, thanks to some intern-level devs who stored everything on a Google bucket with zero protection.

3.  
This isn’t some 4chan “leak.”  
This is corporate negligence on steroids.  
  
Tea didn’t get hacked.  
They handed over your identity to the wild—on a silver platter.  
  
Photos. IDs. Names. Locations.  
All up for grabs. Like a buffet of digital ruin.

1.  
  
Some folks remember the sealed document dump from late 2019. Most don’t.  
  
Buried inside was a name nobody expected: the defense contractor who helped build biometric ID systems in Guantanamo.  
  
Why was he on Epstein’s island log?  
  
That page got redacted shortly after. Quietly.  
  
Hard to find it in official copies now… wonder why?

2.  
  
Back when nobody was watching, Epstein took a “routine” trip to Camp Peary.  
  
That’s the CIA’s covert training site, known as “The Farm.”  
  
They called it a consulting visit. No one ever said what for.  
  
Some say it was about logistics. Others? “Containment protocols.”  
  
Could be nothing. Or everything.

3.  
  
This slipped through the cracks — almost like it was meant to.  
  
In 2008, Epstein’s lawyers requested a special hearing… in a secure federal courtroom used for intel asset disputes.  
  
No cameras. No transcript. No reporters.  
  
One judge recused himself after reviewing the classified annex.  
  
Guess he saw something he didn’t wanna touch.

(1/25)  
  
Most people think Epstein was just some pervert with a plane.  
But there’s a reason that list never saw the light of day.  
  
Not because it’s too dirty.  
But because the wrong names would open the wrong doors.  
  
What if I told you the Pentagon buried part of it—under national security?

(2/25)  
  
There’s a name nobody talks about:  
Douglas Leese.  
British defense contractor. Died in 2011. Not just a businessman—arms deals, offshore assets, intelligence overlaps.  
  
He’s the one who “introduced” Epstein to the game.  
Not Ghislaine. Not Wexner.  
Leese.  
  
Go look. He’s been wiped clean.

(3/25)  
  
In 1987, Steven Hoffenberg (Epstein’s mentor) said Epstein showed up already connected.  
Leese brought him in as “consultant” for a company accused of… wait for it… siphoning money from military pensions.  
  
And no one asked why a 30-something ex-math teacher was at that table.

Tweet 1  
  
Kinda weird how McAfee knew so much before anyone cared about “data sovereignty”.  
  
This wasn’t some quirky coder in a jungle.  
He had offshore keys, embassy pings, satellite logs.  
  
One guy said he tracked NSA packet flow… from a fishing boat in Panama.  
  
No idea if that’s true. But nobody challenged it.  
  
Wonder why folks stopped asking what he was really tracking.

Tweet 2  
  
The part nobody really talks about is Belize—  
Not just the raid, the lab, or the dogs.  
  
It’s what got confiscated and never reported.  
  
A sealed hardcase flown out by someone not in uniform. No chain of custody. No customs file.  
  
McAfee told a journalist:  
“That case had the real virus. And the antidote.”  
  
She vanished three weeks later. Can’t even find her old blog now.  
  
Why do you think that detail never made headlines?

Tweet 3  
  
Back when nobody was watching, something slipped through.  
  
A guy from the embassy brought a folder that didn’t match the original memo.  
  
The date had been changed—but only by one number.  
  
Weeks later, that entire channel was decommissioned. No explanation.  
  
He smiled while saying:  
“They’ll never trace this one.”  
  
Still shocked this hasn’t been flagged yet.  
  
Makes you wonder—how many edits go unreported?
