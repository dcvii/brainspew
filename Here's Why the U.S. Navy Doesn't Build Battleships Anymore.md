### JUST POSTED: January 16, 2026

Battleships—once the most potent symbols of naval supremacy—served as benchmarks for a nation’s maritime strength. But according to Marine Corps University Foundation Chair of Strategic Studies Trent Hone, technological advancements have shifted the utility and strategic importance of these formidable giants over time.

Traditionally, battleships were central to naval fleets, supported by cruisers and destroyers. These ships operated cohesively, utilizing their considerable firepower as fleet engagement remained within relatively short distances. However, as the 20th century progressed, the technological landscape drastically changed with aircraft carriers and submarines emerging as more important tools in naval warfare, allowing engagement at greater distances and utilizing new sensor technologies.

Despite the obsolescence of battleships in traditional naval engagements, their symbolic significance remains. During the Cold War, for instance, battleships like the USS Missouri were recommissioned to demonstrate U.S. national power visually and tangibly. This visibility, paired with notable moments such as their artillery support during conflicts, underscored a broader diplomatic and strategic role. However, the cost and manpower needed to maintain such ships have always posed a challenge, leading to debates about their viability in modern naval strategy.

Hone suggests that the renewed discourse on battleships, spurred by political figures and discussions of the so-called “Trump Class,” should not focus solely on the feasibility of their return but rather on reviving interest in and funding for U.S. naval capabilities. By leveraging the iconic status of battleships to galvanize support, there’s potential to bolster naval investment in ways that align with contemporary strategic needs, such as distributed lethality, which emphasizes flexible, resilient surface combatant groups. Ultimately, while battleships may no longer hold their traditional place in naval fleets, their legacy and symbolic power can still contribute strategically to modern maritime priorities.
