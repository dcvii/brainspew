Give me an idea about the spread of oil refineries in the US. How many of them are there? Where are they located? What are their primary feedstocks and end products. A table would be nice. This might take some time so just give me the top 30 by volume. Also include their owner/operators.

## U.S. refinery footprint (high-level)

- **How many refineries?**
	- **132 operable petroleum refineries** in the U.S. as of **January 1, 2025**.
- **How much capacity?**
	- **18.42 million barrels per calendar day** of **operable atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity** (the standard headline capacity measure).
- **Where are they concentrated?**
	- Capacity is heavily concentrated along the **Gulf Coast** (especially Texas and Louisiana) and **California**; for example **California** shows **~1.64 million b/cd** in Table 3 (and is dominated by LA Basin + Bay Area clusters).
- **What feedstocks do they run (typical)?**
	- U.S. refineries are generally capable of running a **mix of light/heavy and sweet/sour crudes**; many are optimized for heavier, more sour grades even as U.S. production is largely light/sweet.
	- **Midwest refineries** disproportionately run **Canadian crude**, much of it heavier, which has become increasingly important to U.S. refining.
	- **Gulf Coast refineries** run a diverse slate and have become lighter over time as imports declined and domestic light production grew.
	- **West Coast refineries** increasingly rely on **imports** as Alaska/California production has declined.
- **What do they make (typical “end products”)?**
	- U.S. refinery output is dominated by **transport fuels**. From a 42-gallon barrel in 2023, the average yield was roughly **~19.6 gal gasoline**, **~12.5 gal distillate (diesel/heating)**, **~4.4 gal jet**, with additional volumes of LPG/HGL, petroleum coke, asphalt, etc.

## Top 30 U.S. refineries by crude distillation capacity (b/cd)

- Capacities below are **EIA “total operable atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity”** as of **January 1, 2025**.
- “Primary feedstock” and “end products” are **typical** for that region/configuration (not a guaranteed product slate for every barrel).

## Notes on interpretation (so the table is usable)

- The “capacity” ranking here is **crude distillation (front-end) capacity**, not actual throughput in any given week (utilization varies with economics, maintenance, outages, storms, etc.).
- “Primary feedstocks” are best thought of as **regional supply realities**:
	- Midwest: Canadian crude is structurally important
	- Gulf Coast: broad crude flexibility; long-running tilt toward heavier/sour capability
	- West Coast: higher import reliance as local production declines
- “End products” are dominated by transportation fuels nationally, but **actual refinery product slates** depend on configuration and local fuel specs (notably California).

If you want, I can also add one more column for each refinery showing a **simple “complexity proxy”** (e.g., whether it has coking/hydrocracking capacity) using EIA downstream unit capacity tables from the same report series.
