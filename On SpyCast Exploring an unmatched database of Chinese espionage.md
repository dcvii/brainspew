(International Spy Museum)

I was sitting inside the podcast studio of the International Spy Museum. Nick Eftimiades had just handed me his laptop so that I could scroll through his sprawling database.

Nick is a former senior intelligence officer with a 34-year career in government that spans the CIA, State Department, and Defense Intelligence Agency. In his retirement, he has documented nearly 900 cases of Chinese espionage, offering unparalleled insights into China’s intelligence operations. Just imagine who would want access to the database.

In this episode of SpyCast, Nick talks about the cases — sharing stories of strong and weak tradecraft. (Copying classified documents at a FedEx, anybody?) He described a recent case of the Chinese Communist Party planting a political candidate in California. And the longterm strategies to advance Beijing’s interests.

Under President Xi Jinping, Nick says the country has significantly expanded its intelligence capabilities. And Sun Tzu's ancient *Art of War* is a foundational philosophy guiding China’s strategy of controlling adversaries without direct confrontation, using tactics like covert influence and economic warfare.

“All our people are like fish in the ocean,” Nick says, quoting Mao Zedong, the founder of the People’s Republic of China. “They’re all eyes, watching any threat and all comes back to the \[Chinese Communist\] Party. A longterm asset in the Ministry of State Security is called ‘a fish on the bottom of the ocean.’”

In deeply tracking these cases, Nick says the United States should be worried. “We’re a long way off from from really being able to contend with it.”
