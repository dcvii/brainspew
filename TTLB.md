The Truth Laid Bear (TTLB) Blogosphere Ecosystem was an influential blog ranking system created by Rob Neppell, who went by the pseudonym "NZ Bear." This system ranked blogs based on their popularity, measured by inbound and outbound links as well as traffic. The rankings were designed to provide a comprehensive picture of the blogosphere's landscape, categorizing blogs into various levels from "Higher Beings" to "Insignificant Microbes."

The TTLB Blogosphere Ecosystem was popular in the early 2000s and provided a fun and competitive way for bloggers to gauge their influence. Major blogs like Instapundit and Daily Kos often ranked highly, categorized as "Higher Beings," while newer or less popular blogs fell into categories like "Slithering Reptiles" or "Lowly Insects"【8†source】【9†source】【10†source】.
