I was born in 1961. I’ve encountered all sorts of racism, I suppose. When I was born, African Americans were called Negroes. Negroes had a certain way of dealing with racial prejudice. They survived. Then came something (to be very brief about it) called ‘Black Consciousness’. Those who called themselves Black had a certain different way of dealing with racial prejudice. They survived. Around that same time, the Nation of Islam had a very popular book called ‘Message to the Black Man’ and suggested that White Christians were the problem and therefore Black Muslims should have a different way of dealing with racial prejudice. Black college student radicals had Black Power. Black Southerners joined groups like the SCLC or the Congress of Racial Equality. Every bunch of African Americans, from every region, in each generation had their preferred way of dealing with racial prejudice. As much as people like to think so today, they never all agreed. Of course various other groups of Americans had their ideas about the best way to deal with racial prejudice faced by African Americans, and they never all agreed either. Today, the consequences of racial prejudice as well as the consistency of it and the reasons for it is all different. But most people think they have ‘the’ answer. The problem, as I see it, is that too many third parties keep speculating from position X, what people in position Y are doing to people in position Z. Sometimes you have to admit that people figure it out for themselves. That’s really just common sense, but… you have to admit that if you think all black Americans experience life the same way then ‘we’ could solve all of ‘their’ problems once and for all. I think the most healthy way to deal with this is to recognize the strength people find to overcome adversity. When you do a lot of pushups, you get stronger. Instead people are like ‘wow, what’s it like to have to do all those pushups?’ This is how it feels to me to be asked about racism. Kids in my generation grew up with the following mentality: It has been so long since I’ve been a bag of bones.

Where did you find that ad? That’s like from a 1950’s comic book.

Unfortunately I remember these as a toddler =)

From the 60s & early 70s.

I remember that comic from Charles Atlas. Good choice.
