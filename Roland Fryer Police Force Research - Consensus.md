	## Scope of Fryer’s Study vs. Other Work
	Fryer’s 2016 Journal of Political Economy paper assembled multi‑city data on nonlethal force and officer‑involved shootings and is widely described as a **major empirical advance** on race and police force [7](https://consensus.app/papers/an-empirical-analysis-of-racial-differences-in-police-use-fryer/3f59300d149e5efa8796817e8c023501/) [17](https://consensus.app/papers/resolution-of-apparent-paradoxes-in-the-racespecific-ross-winterhalder/91d5f6f7401c543684f4ccfbfd5a980d/). However, it is not clearly the “largest” in terms of observations or breadth:
	- A quasi‑experiment on racial profiling in New York City used **3.9 million pedestrian stops**, a much larger single dataset than Fryer’s shooting sample [5](https://consensus.app/papers/racial-profiling-and-use-of-force-in-police-stops-how-local-legewie/0f2a6d90333f50b481ae37cdf9e7de5b/).
	- A study of **1.6 million 911 calls** in two cities examined race, officer identity, and force, including shootings, again on a larger raw scale than Fryer’s shooting data [12](https://consensus.app/papers/does-race-matter-for-police-use-of-force-evidence-from-911-hoekstra-sloan/ab7f3e567c3c5638a1270e8993e8ed1b/).
	- A multicity use‑of‑force project deliberately sampled numerous agencies (though avoiding the very largest like NYPD and LAPD) to enhance generalizability, not sheer size [8](https://consensus.app/papers/mental-illness-police-use-of-force-and-citizen-injury-rossler-terrill/44646ed9b77f5152a74c5dc7e3eb7f95/).
	Recent systematic reviews show that the *field* now contains hundreds of empirical studies and very large administrative datasets, rather than one dominant “largest” analysis [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/) [9](https://consensus.app/papers/advancing-police-use-of-force-research-and-practice-urgent-bennell-alpert/b99ab9aaaf5252e9a7d77c8fb1749347/) [16](https://consensus.app/papers/addressing-the-inappropriate-use-of-force-by-police-in-the-boxer-brunson/79f988f662d354d68e9baa8a9186b28a/).

	## Conclusion
	Fryer’s work is one of the most prominent and methodologically influential studies on racial differences in police use of force, but other research has used equal or larger datasets. There is no evidence that his was the single largest empirical study in this area.
	## Results
- ## Were his findings substantially different than the other large studies? If so, how?
	## Yes. Fryer’s findings on shootings differ notably from other large studies, mainly by not finding racial disparities in officer-involved shootings once he conditions on encounters.
	Did Roland Fryer’s study reach substantially different conclusions about racial bias in police use of force than other large studies?
	Requires at least 5 papers that directly answer your question. Try adjusting your query to find more papers.

	## How Fryer’s Results Compare
	### 1\. Nonlethal force (general agreement)
	- Fryer finds Black and Hispanic civilians are **\>50% more likely** to experience nonlethal force than whites, even after controls, though gaps shrink with covariates [3](https://consensus.app/papers/an-empirical-analysis-of-racial-differences-in-police-use/9412f7952d22503aadae0809f51bbbf7/).
	- Large stop-and-frisk and stop-level studies similarly find **substantial racial disparities**, especially in force and “potential lethal force” against Black civilians, even after adjusting for behavior and context [6](https://consensus.app/papers/stop-frisk-and-assault-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-kramer-remster/58df7902aa7857538681a30f5f81c6cd/).  
		→ On **nonlethal** force, his findings are broadly consistent with other large datasets [2](https://consensus.app/papers/explaining-the-disparity-in-results-across-studies-fridell/6367a09b6de5507ea855c019482dd3d0/) [6](https://consensus.app/papers/stop-frisk-and-assault-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-kramer-remster/58df7902aa7857538681a30f5f81c6cd/).
	### 2\. Shootings / potentially lethal force (main divergence)
	- Fryer reports **no racial differences** in officer-involved shootings in his multi-city data, either raw or conditional on context, and interprets this as evidence *against* discrimination in shootings [3](https://consensus.app/papers/an-empirical-analysis-of-racial-differences-in-police-use/9412f7952d22503aadae0809f51bbbf7/).
	- A detailed critique argues his data and methods **do not credibly establish absence of discrimination** in shootings and that the “no bias” claim is overstated [1](https://consensus.app/papers/an-empirical-analysis-of-racial-differences-in-police-use-durlauf-heckman/ca97cacc050658ed8a21f8a8632acca9/).
	- Other large quasi-experimental designs using 1.6M 911 calls find Black and Hispanic civilians are **much more likely to experience any force and police shootings**, especially when white officers respond, implying race-linked risk in lethal force [5](https://consensus.app/papers/does-race-matter-for-police-use-of-force-evidence-from-911-hoekstra-sloan/ab7f3e567c3c5638a1270e8993e8ed1b/).
	- NYPD stop data show Black civilians face **disproportionate exposure to potential lethal force** (e.g., weapon drawn) versus whites [6](https://consensus.app/papers/stop-frisk-and-assault-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-kramer-remster/58df7902aa7857538681a30f5f81c6cd/).
	### 3\. Why results differ
	Reviews point to differences in:
	- **Sampling** (which agencies, what kinds of encounters are in the data)
	- **Outcome definition** (actual shootings vs. “potential lethal force”)
	- **Modeling choices and conditioning** (e.g., conditioning on being “in an encounter”) [2](https://consensus.app/papers/explaining-the-disparity-in-results-across-studies-fridell/6367a09b6de5507ea855c019482dd3d0/).

	## Conclusion
	Fryer’s strong “no racial difference in shootings” conclusion is substantially more skeptical about racial bias in lethal force than other large studies, which generally do find elevated risks for Black and Hispanic civilians; his nonlethal-force findings, however, align more closely with the broader literature.
	## Results
- ## OK take race out of the picture. What is the the baseline incidence of police use of force? IE outside of race what are the most significant causal factors?
	## Baseline patterns and main non-race drivers of police force
	Setting race aside, research points to a fairly consistent set of situational and behavioral predictors of whether force is used at all, and how severe it is.
	### How often is force used at all?
	Precise “baseline” population rates are hard to pin down because there is no comprehensive national recording system for all levels of force, and agencies differ in reporting practices [5](https://consensus.app/papers/race-crime-and-the-micro%E2%80%90ecology-of-deadly-force-klinger-rosenfeld/6a05567da8715f3a94c9939d664e1a89/) [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/). Reviews emphasize that what is known best is *deadly* force, not lower levels, and even there national counts are incomplete [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/) [5](https://consensus.app/papers/race-crime-and-the-micro%E2%80%90ecology-of-deadly-force-klinger-rosenfeld/6a05567da8715f3a94c9939d664e1a89/). So the literature speaks more clearly to *what predicts* force, than to an exact probability per encounter or per resident.
	### Key causal factors other than race
	Evidence from large observational datasets, body‑worn camera studies, and systematic reviews identifies several robust correlates:
	### 1\. Suspect behavior and resistance (strongest consistent predictor)
	Across many studies and in a systematic review of psychological and social factors, **suspect resistance and threatening behavior** are the most consistent predictors of whether officers use force and how much [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	- In Dallas (7,858 incidents, 2014–2016), “most situational factors showed significant associations” with severity of force, including indicators of suspect behavior [1](https://consensus.app/papers/a-comprehensive-examination-on-police-use-of-force-from-han-laprade/b701d49074845f77a0dc79cd62899543/).
	- Reviews of use‑of‑force research similarly highlight **amount and type of resistance**, seriousness of the offense, and weapon presence as central legal/situational drivers [8](https://consensus.app/papers/race-and-the-use-of-force-by-police-revisited-postferguson-smith-tillyer/06d6fbd7aa5855c186b4c75ebc34ec61/) [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	- A body‑camera study found that **suspect resistance strongly predicted both time-to-force and duration of force** in encounters [17](https://consensus.app/papers/show-me-what-happened-willits-makin/3e368421f0045daf9a71d6bc523f59be/).
	### 2\. Weapon presence and perceived threat
	For deadly force specifically, **civilian possession of a weapon (especially a firearm)** is repeatedly identified as the most consistent risk factor [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/).
	- A decade-long systematic review concludes that weapon possession is the **single most consistent determinant of police use of deadly force**, far more stable than demographic or structural factors [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/).
	### 3\. Offense type and call type
	The nature of the incident strongly shapes risk of deadly force:
	- Analysis of five years of Washington Post shooting data found the top contexts for shootings were:
		1. **assault or civilian call for help**,
		2. **domestic violence**, and
		3. **officer being attacked** [20](https://consensus.app/papers/differential-race-outcomes-in-police-shootings-applying-garrison/0fe0fbc50f6f59cfb9d6ef201df46f3f/).
	### 4\. Neighborhood crime and ecology
	At the place level, **violent crime levels** and related ecological factors matter:
	- In St. Louis, neighborhood **violent crime rates** increased police shootings up to a point; race or economic disadvantage of the neighborhood had no independent effect once crime was considered [5](https://consensus.app/papers/race-crime-and-the-micro%E2%80%90ecology-of-deadly-force-klinger-rosenfeld/6a05567da8715f3a94c9939d664e1a89/).
	- Other neighborhood-level work finds **higher crime in small areas is associated with more legitimate force**, even when individual race is controlled [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	### 5\. Organizational policies, training, and equipment
	Departmental context also shapes baseline force:
	- A systematic review finds **department policies, managerial organization, and the environment of encounters** influence force decisions [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	- Studies note that **de‑escalation training and clearer policies** can reduce overall incidence of force [8](https://consensus.app/papers/race-and-the-use-of-force-by-police-revisited-postferguson-smith-tillyer/06d6fbd7aa5855c186b4c75ebc34ec61/) [13](https://consensus.app/papers/addressing-the-inappropriate-use-of-force-by-police-in-the-boxer-brunson/79f988f662d354d68e9baa8a9186b28a/).
	- Carrying certain equipment (e.g., conducted energy devices) can change patterns of when and how force is applied [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	### 6\. Officer and citizen demographics (net of race)
	When race is removed, **gender and age** still matter:
	- Men are more likely than women to be subjected to force [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/) [17](https://consensus.app/papers/show-me-what-happened-willits-makin/3e368421f0045daf9a71d6bc523f59be/).
	- Younger civilians are at somewhat higher risk in some settings, particularly for nonlethal force [2](https://consensus.app/papers/stop-frisk-and-assault-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-kramer-remster/58df7902aa7857538681a30f5f81c6cd/) [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).

	Figure 1 Non-racial predictors of police use of force.
	## Bottom line
	Outside of race, the clearest causal drivers identified are **suspect resistance and behavior, weapon presence (especially guns), the seriousness and type of incident, local violent crime levels, and agency policies/training**. Exact “baseline” probabilities are poorly measured nationally, but these factors systematically move the risk of force up or down in the available research.

	## Scope of Fryer’s Study vs. Other Work
	Fryer’s 2016 Journal of Political Economy paper assembled multi‑city data on nonlethal force and officer‑involved shootings and is widely described as a **major empirical advance** on race and police force [7](https://consensus.app/papers/an-empirical-analysis-of-racial-differences-in-police-use-fryer/3f59300d149e5efa8796817e8c023501/) [17](https://consensus.app/papers/resolution-of-apparent-paradoxes-in-the-racespecific-ross-winterhalder/91d5f6f7401c543684f4ccfbfd5a980d/). However, it is not clearly the “largest” in terms of observations or breadth:
	- A quasi‑experiment on racial profiling in New York City used **3.9 million pedestrian stops**, a much larger single dataset than Fryer’s shooting sample [5](https://consensus.app/papers/racial-profiling-and-use-of-force-in-police-stops-how-local-legewie/0f2a6d90333f50b481ae37cdf9e7de5b/).
	- A study of **1.6 million 911 calls** in two cities examined race, officer identity, and force, including shootings, again on a larger raw scale than Fryer’s shooting data [12](https://consensus.app/papers/does-race-matter-for-police-use-of-force-evidence-from-911-hoekstra-sloan/ab7f3e567c3c5638a1270e8993e8ed1b/).
	- A multicity use‑of‑force project deliberately sampled numerous agencies (though avoiding the very largest like NYPD and LAPD) to enhance generalizability, not sheer size [8](https://consensus.app/papers/mental-illness-police-use-of-force-and-citizen-injury-rossler-terrill/44646ed9b77f5152a74c5dc7e3eb7f95/).
	Recent systematic reviews show that the *field* now contains hundreds of empirical studies and very large administrative datasets, rather than one dominant “largest” analysis [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/) [9](https://consensus.app/papers/advancing-police-use-of-force-research-and-practice-urgent-bennell-alpert/b99ab9aaaf5252e9a7d77c8fb1749347/) [16](https://consensus.app/papers/addressing-the-inappropriate-use-of-force-by-police-in-the-boxer-brunson/79f988f662d354d68e9baa8a9186b28a/).

	## Conclusion
	Fryer’s work is one of the most prominent and methodologically influential studies on racial differences in police use of force, but other research has used equal or larger datasets. There is no evidence that his was the single largest empirical study in this area.
	## Results
- ## Were his findings substantially different than the other large studies? If so, how?
	## Yes. Fryer’s findings on shootings differ notably from other large studies, mainly by not finding racial disparities in officer-involved shootings once he conditions on encounters.
	Did Roland Fryer’s study reach substantially different conclusions about racial bias in police use of force than other large studies?
	Requires at least 5 papers that directly answer your question. Try adjusting your query to find more papers.

	## How Fryer’s Results Compare
	### 1\. Nonlethal force (general agreement)
	- Fryer finds Black and Hispanic civilians are **\>50% more likely** to experience nonlethal force than whites, even after controls, though gaps shrink with covariates [3](https://consensus.app/papers/an-empirical-analysis-of-racial-differences-in-police-use/9412f7952d22503aadae0809f51bbbf7/).
	- Large stop-and-frisk and stop-level studies similarly find **substantial racial disparities**, especially in force and “potential lethal force” against Black civilians, even after adjusting for behavior and context [6](https://consensus.app/papers/stop-frisk-and-assault-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-kramer-remster/58df7902aa7857538681a30f5f81c6cd/).  
		→ On **nonlethal** force, his findings are broadly consistent with other large datasets [2](https://consensus.app/papers/explaining-the-disparity-in-results-across-studies-fridell/6367a09b6de5507ea855c019482dd3d0/) [6](https://consensus.app/papers/stop-frisk-and-assault-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-kramer-remster/58df7902aa7857538681a30f5f81c6cd/).
	### 2\. Shootings / potentially lethal force (main divergence)
	- Fryer reports **no racial differences** in officer-involved shootings in his multi-city data, either raw or conditional on context, and interprets this as evidence *against* discrimination in shootings [3](https://consensus.app/papers/an-empirical-analysis-of-racial-differences-in-police-use/9412f7952d22503aadae0809f51bbbf7/).
	- A detailed critique argues his data and methods **do not credibly establish absence of discrimination** in shootings and that the “no bias” claim is overstated [1](https://consensus.app/papers/an-empirical-analysis-of-racial-differences-in-police-use-durlauf-heckman/ca97cacc050658ed8a21f8a8632acca9/).
	- Other large quasi-experimental designs using 1.6M 911 calls find Black and Hispanic civilians are **much more likely to experience any force and police shootings**, especially when white officers respond, implying race-linked risk in lethal force [5](https://consensus.app/papers/does-race-matter-for-police-use-of-force-evidence-from-911-hoekstra-sloan/ab7f3e567c3c5638a1270e8993e8ed1b/).
	- NYPD stop data show Black civilians face **disproportionate exposure to potential lethal force** (e.g., weapon drawn) versus whites [6](https://consensus.app/papers/stop-frisk-and-assault-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-kramer-remster/58df7902aa7857538681a30f5f81c6cd/).
	### 3\. Why results differ
	Reviews point to differences in:
	- **Sampling** (which agencies, what kinds of encounters are in the data)
	- **Outcome definition** (actual shootings vs. “potential lethal force”)
	- **Modeling choices and conditioning** (e.g., conditioning on being “in an encounter”) [2](https://consensus.app/papers/explaining-the-disparity-in-results-across-studies-fridell/6367a09b6de5507ea855c019482dd3d0/).

	## Conclusion
	Fryer’s strong “no racial difference in shootings” conclusion is substantially more skeptical about racial bias in lethal force than other large studies, which generally do find elevated risks for Black and Hispanic civilians; his nonlethal-force findings, however, align more closely with the broader literature.
	## Results
- ## OK take race out of the picture. What is the the baseline incidence of police use of force? IE outside of race what are the most significant causal factors?
	## Baseline patterns and main non-race drivers of police force
	Setting race aside, research points to a fairly consistent set of situational and behavioral predictors of whether force is used at all, and how severe it is.
	### How often is force used at all?
	Precise “baseline” population rates are hard to pin down because there is no comprehensive national recording system for all levels of force, and agencies differ in reporting practices [5](https://consensus.app/papers/race-crime-and-the-micro%E2%80%90ecology-of-deadly-force-klinger-rosenfeld/6a05567da8715f3a94c9939d664e1a89/) [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/). Reviews emphasize that what is known best is *deadly* force, not lower levels, and even there national counts are incomplete [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/) [5](https://consensus.app/papers/race-crime-and-the-micro%E2%80%90ecology-of-deadly-force-klinger-rosenfeld/6a05567da8715f3a94c9939d664e1a89/). So the literature speaks more clearly to *what predicts* force, than to an exact probability per encounter or per resident.
	### Key causal factors other than race
	Evidence from large observational datasets, body‑worn camera studies, and systematic reviews identifies several robust correlates:
	### 1\. Suspect behavior and resistance (strongest consistent predictor)
	Across many studies and in a systematic review of psychological and social factors, **suspect resistance and threatening behavior** are the most consistent predictors of whether officers use force and how much [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	- In Dallas (7,858 incidents, 2014–2016), “most situational factors showed significant associations” with severity of force, including indicators of suspect behavior [1](https://consensus.app/papers/a-comprehensive-examination-on-police-use-of-force-from-han-laprade/b701d49074845f77a0dc79cd62899543/).
	- Reviews of use‑of‑force research similarly highlight **amount and type of resistance**, seriousness of the offense, and weapon presence as central legal/situational drivers [8](https://consensus.app/papers/race-and-the-use-of-force-by-police-revisited-postferguson-smith-tillyer/06d6fbd7aa5855c186b4c75ebc34ec61/) [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	- A body‑camera study found that **suspect resistance strongly predicted both time-to-force and duration of force** in encounters [17](https://consensus.app/papers/show-me-what-happened-willits-makin/3e368421f0045daf9a71d6bc523f59be/).
	### 2\. Weapon presence and perceived threat
	For deadly force specifically, **civilian possession of a weapon (especially a firearm)** is repeatedly identified as the most consistent risk factor [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/).
	- A decade-long systematic review concludes that weapon possession is the **single most consistent determinant of police use of deadly force**, far more stable than demographic or structural factors [3](https://consensus.app/papers/a-decade-of-police-use-of-deadly-force-research-2011%E2%80%932020-mora-terrill/c7d9c7b8da9c5ed99110ee8988dab0b1/).
	### 3\. Offense type and call type
	The nature of the incident strongly shapes risk of deadly force:
	- Analysis of five years of Washington Post shooting data found the top contexts for shootings were:
		1. **assault or civilian call for help**,
		2. **domestic violence**, and
		3. **officer being attacked** [20](https://consensus.app/papers/differential-race-outcomes-in-police-shootings-applying-garrison/0fe0fbc50f6f59cfb9d6ef201df46f3f/).
	### 4\. Neighborhood crime and ecology
	At the place level, **violent crime levels** and related ecological factors matter:
	- In St. Louis, neighborhood **violent crime rates** increased police shootings up to a point; race or economic disadvantage of the neighborhood had no independent effect once crime was considered [5](https://consensus.app/papers/race-crime-and-the-micro%E2%80%90ecology-of-deadly-force-klinger-rosenfeld/6a05567da8715f3a94c9939d664e1a89/).
	- Other neighborhood-level work finds **higher crime in small areas is associated with more legitimate force**, even when individual race is controlled [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	### 5\. Organizational policies, training, and equipment
	Departmental context also shapes baseline force:
	- A systematic review finds **department policies, managerial organization, and the environment of encounters** influence force decisions [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	- Studies note that **de‑escalation training and clearer policies** can reduce overall incidence of force [8](https://consensus.app/papers/race-and-the-use-of-force-by-police-revisited-postferguson-smith-tillyer/06d6fbd7aa5855c186b4c75ebc34ec61/) [13](https://consensus.app/papers/addressing-the-inappropriate-use-of-force-by-police-in-the-boxer-brunson/79f988f662d354d68e9baa8a9186b28a/).
	- Carrying certain equipment (e.g., conducted energy devices) can change patterns of when and how force is applied [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).
	### 6\. Officer and citizen demographics (net of race)
	When race is removed, **gender and age** still matter:
	- Men are more likely than women to be subjected to force [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/) [17](https://consensus.app/papers/show-me-what-happened-willits-makin/3e368421f0045daf9a71d6bc523f59be/).
	- Younger civilians are at somewhat higher risk in some settings, particularly for nonlethal force [2](https://consensus.app/papers/stop-frisk-and-assault-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-kramer-remster/58df7902aa7857538681a30f5f81c6cd/) [15](https://consensus.app/papers/psychological-and-sociological-factors-influencing-cojean-combalbert/0464b0a6bc2f587c9c63a068bcc6f8eb/).

	Figure 1 Non-racial predictors of police use of force.
	## Bottom line
	Outside of race, the clearest causal drivers identified are **suspect resistance and behavior, weapon presence (especially guns), the seriousness and type of incident, local violent crime levels, and agency policies/training**. Exact “baseline” probabilities are poorly measured nationally, but these factors systematically move the risk of force up or down in the available research.
