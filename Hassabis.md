Sir Demis Hassabis is the most dangerous CEO alive:  
  
â€¢ Chess prodigy at age 4  
â€¢ Knighted in 2023 for services to AI  
â€¢ Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024  
  
He now leads Google's DeepMind AI  
  
His vision of the next 10 years will terrify you ðŸ§µ

When Hassabis makes predictions, you should listen.  
  
He co-founded DeepMind in 2010 with a bold 20-year mission to build AGI.  
  
13 years later, they're exactly on track.  
  
His team has delivered breakthrough after breakthrough: <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379189616844800/pl/Gdpg8ZLduHygcuDi.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=ad3&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379189616844800/vid/avc1/480x270/NnZi_3kRKBkCWNFf.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379189616844800/vid/avc1/640x360/iawG1i1LuUyudSri.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379189616844800/vid/avc1/1280x720/U4h7QYXrX1KorphK.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

â€¢ Google AlphaFold solved protein structure prediction  
â€¢ Multiple foundational AI research advances  
  
Every major breakthrough traces back to rigorous DeepMind research.  
  
When he talks AGI timelines, he's earned the right to be heard: <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379279618215936/pl/aK7So806H0v4iBjV.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=759&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379279618215936/vid/avc1/480x270/EEQC4SwQpJJDWs54.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379279618215936/vid/avc1/640x360/yNiqbD_yD3elPS_U.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379279618215936/vid/avc1/1280x720/CYXNSo1K39WxR-8t.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

His latest prediction?  
  
AGI arrives just after 2030.  
  
That's 5-7 years from now.  
  
Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder, thinks it's even sooner - before 2030.  
  
But Hassabis has a uniquely high bar for what counts as AGI... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379387969642496/pl/7RrPKrLa-cCipDZH.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=b90&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379387969642496/vid/avc1/480x270/2biexP76NPF_DJ9E.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379387969642496/vid/avc1/640x360/tOGNysBoWOpCqHps.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379387969642496/vid/avc1/1280x720/PGlH1DaW2JKqWLjh.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Most people think AGI means "smarter than humans."  
  
Hassabis thinks deeper.  
  
His definition: Systems that can do anything the human brain can do, even theoretically.  
  
That includes true out-of-the-box invention and flawless consistency: <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379473495638017/pl/Lt4EOEc-YAORqDVz.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=b20&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379473495638017/vid/avc1/480x270/oKYeINO5I6VzX_8o.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379473495638017/vid/avc1/640x360/ReR9emfdM-Oeua9U.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379473495638017/vid/avc1/1280x720/iQoke6vbY6w3pWpq.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Today's AI can solve mathematical conjectures.  
  
But it can't invent the Riemann Hypothesis.  
  
It can write code, but experts easily find trivial flaws.  
  
AGI will change that completely, and Hassabis says we're "past the middle game": <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379580572049408/pl/yKqMTexGPT8WZ7kG.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=655&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379580572049408/vid/avc1/480x270/oq9zpY_8ng7JoboG.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379580572049408/vid/avc1/640x360/DuPRHc_dMpDMSoL6.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379580572049408/vid/avc1/1280x720/dTz_fLiKFFCu6Lpu.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

The job market disruption is already starting.  
  
Hassabis points to data science teams shrinking from 75 people to 1.  
  
But he's not worried about mass unemployment.  
  
Instead, he sees a fundamental shift in how we work: <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379684666318848/pl/eWoreKpxoMPSatfO.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=88c&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379684666318848/vid/avc1/480x270/VImQgiZcgx1p5rUW.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379684666318848/vid/avc1/640x360/dpUZI67PEGWhdIGy.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379684666318848/vid/avc1/1280x720/DsB9jnp51H-nOt0_.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

The winners will master "meta-skills":  
  
â€¢ Learning to learn  
â€¢ Creativity  
â€¢ Adaptability  
  
Plus becoming "AI native" - using tools so well you become superhuman.  
  
But the biggest change is coming to education itself: <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379895388143616/pl/5QKTwRJukLPVb0yF.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=df6&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379895388143616/vid/avc1/480x270/YES4DsZdg-T2F3pG.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379895388143616/vid/avc1/640x360/yNcDmXBk7GfNIBrP.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927379895388143616/vid/avc1/1280x720/Whs-kwOEse-h44e2.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Universities might become less relevant.  
  
AI tutors will provide personalized education to anyone, anywhere.  
  
Kids growing up "AI native" will adapt faster than we can imagine.  
  
But there's a darker geopolitical reality emerging... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380008156246017/pl/YKlbJmVU983BOPYL.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380008156246017/vid/avc1/480x270/U1uivsNKA80sQivA.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380008156246017/vid/avc1/640x360/7axsI2Glnj8r8uK9.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380008156246017/vid/avc1/1280x720/oO5NQEMTqgZBuqBp.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

AGI is becoming the center of a new Cold War.  
  
Export controls are tightening.  
  
Countries are racing to build AI powerhouses in the Middle East.  
  
Hassabis warns: "We're all in this together" - but cooperation is getting harder. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380107921952768/pl/EBNrb-fraEa7LzXk.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380107921952768/vid/avc1/480x270/6v5CpsvkGHPFfxB7.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380107921952768/vid/avc1/640x360/LfHFQE6lsPXHIrOA.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380107921952768/vid/avc1/1280x720/Yk13wcbd1yWkYjiR.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

The deeper question: What happens to human meaning?  
  
Hassabis predicts "radical abundance" - AI making everything incredibly cheap.  
  
Universal high income might become necessary.  
  
Some predict a religious revival as people seek purpose: <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380246849781761/pl/LIlJCv8WOXh6UNuO.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380246849781761/vid/avc1/480x270/nobyeo_r1sTfQrdu.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380246849781761/vid/avc1/640x360/GOifeiOBVhhkQEDG.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380246849781761/vid/avc1/1280x720/IitF9v9SYBUnZz2n.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

But some things will always be uniquely human.  
  
Human-to-human emotional connection.  
  
The soul in art that comes from real struggle and experience.  
  
Even Van Gogh's brushstrokes carry his torture - AI can't replicate that. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380337136381952/pl/soZrWzYlPD0256aE.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380337136381952/vid/avc1/480x270/H4v5tNCKyxnPZh89.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380337136381952/vid/avc1/640x360/FX7Wy7PTajLi4ZYV.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1927380337136381952/vid/avc1/1280x720/R4q5RnUNpFTEiMPp.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

So how do you prepare for this future?  
  
Hassabis's advice for the next generation:  
  
â€¢ Don't abandon STEM fundamentals  
â€¢ Become an AI tool ninja now  
â€¢ Focus on creativity and adaptability  
  
The only certainty is massive change ahead.

Coinbase just lost $400M in the most embarrassing way possible:  
  
Their own employees sold out customer data to hackers.  
  
CEO Brian Armstrong had 2 choices: pay the $20M ransom or fight back.  
  
His response in the next 24 hours shocked the entire industry.  
  
Here's the wild story:

In January, hackers found a simple backdoor to Coinbase customer data:  
  
The company's own employees.  
  
They bribed contract workers in customer support, offering cash for sensitive user information.  
  
This continued for nearly 5 months undetected.

The breach exposed the most sensitive data:  
â€¢ Names and contact info  
â€¢ Government-issued ID images  
â€¢ Crypto balances and transaction history  
â€¢ Geographic location data  
  
This wasn't just a privacy issue â€“ it created physical danger. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924842628644020225/pl/G_2ssLqtGEXhRRmg.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=5fe&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924842628644020225/vid/avc1/480x270/Pyj-NeQ8eq83YV-l.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924842628644020225/vid/avc1/640x360/5QHRTC7SRluZrJFJ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924842628644020225/vid/avc1/1280x720/5OI6CDjBngj7V4B1.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Before 1996, Qatar was a barren desert of 320k people  
  
Yesterday, they casually spent $96B on Boeing Jets - the largest purchase in history  
  
Their $450B fund owns more of London than the British Royal Family  
  
How desert rulers engineered the West's silent takeover:  

The journey starts with a "disappointing" discovery.  
  
In 1971, Qatar and Shell found something beneath the Persian Gulf they thought was worthless.  
  
Not oil (which they wanted). Just natural gas.  
  
But this disappointing find would change everything: <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1923027383562719232/pl/kQTMk74HPjBMFgTa.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=a46&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1923027383562719232/vid/avc1/480x270/8zeQyjHeG30E5uXs.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1923027383562719232/vid/avc1/640x360/jfWa3nTqbEK7HHLk.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1923027383562719232/vid/avc1/1280x720/q0Wf9UWfcK-wPOqP.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

They'd stumbled upon the North Fieldâ€”the largest natural gas reservoir ever discovered.  
  
This field contains about 10% of global gas reserves.  
  
Qatar couldn't do much with it yet. The technology to export gas profitably didn't exist.  
  
It sat untapped for decades... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1923027452861050880/pl/7EgMLfHyYYChAaYE.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=889&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1923027452861050880/vid/avc1/480x270/uPNVoIHRAs_87r5f.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1923027452861050880/vid/avc1/640x360/LgQqB8vnLcb0xng2.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1923027452861050880/vid/avc1/1280x720/6gTvVO-z528gwAiT.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

In 1965, Malaysia expelled Singapore to die alone.  
  
One-third living in slums. No resources. No army.  
  
Today: A $548B economy with more millionaires per capita than London or New York.  
  
The blueprint that turned this tiny island into a GLOBAL juggernaut:  

Singapore's expulsion wasn't just a political breakupâ€”it was intended as a death sentence.  
  
Malaysian PM Tunku Abdul Rahman expected Singapore to fail without Malaysia's larger market and resources.  
  
He was wrong.  
  
Singapore became independent on August 9, 1965. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917957998535999488/pl/6X0H9V-PEUCwn6Bd.m3u8?tag=14&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917957998535999488/vid/avc1/480x270/OuHFKu3s1raVRZfd.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917957998535999488/vid/avc1/640x360/q7XHBBWRilA2ClIO.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917957998535999488/vid/avc1/1280x720/XQWRhCYigd3vD35U.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew broke down in tears on live TV:  
  
"For me, it is a moment of anguish. All my life, I have believed in merger and unity."  
  
His raw emotion revealed how dire the situation truly was. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917958069004476418/pl/bKiVjhwGGRM2Eayx.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=16d&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917958069004476418/vid/avc1/480x270/jAYIQG22DEWe6NeY.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917958069004476418/vid/avc1/640x360/MGG52vZpK7hI3w6Q.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917958069004476418/vid/avc1/1280x720/t1s51nJVD3m1st4-.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

In 2023, $42bn was withdrawn from Silicon Valley Bank in just 24 hours.  
  
It wasnâ€™t just a crash but a nightmare that rewrote history for Tech.  
  
Hereâ€™s how ONE phone call destroyed $200bn overnight:  

Silicon Valley Bank wasn't just any bank.  
  
It served nearly half of all US venture-backed startups. By end of 2022, it held $189.2B in deposits.  
  
Its stock price had tripled from 2018 to 2021.  
  
But trouble was brewing beneath the surface... <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917257130421428224/pl/MXjzJDjJGSuXIloe.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=475&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917257130421428224/vid/avc1/480x270/xMCsJpHZ3vuN8qDN.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917257130421428224/vid/avc1/640x360/ZpBochdT62Wzeojp.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917257130421428224/vid/avc1/1280x720/Desy2pz7HCjHttNo.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

As SVB's deposits surged during the pandemic tech boom, leaders made a critical mistake:  
  
They invested heavily in long-term bonds when rates were at historic lows.  
  
When the Fed raised rates to fight inflation in 2022, those bonds lost significant value.  
  
The trap was set. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917257256305115136/pl/5XN68UpMyrkhDYde.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=7f0&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917257256305115136/vid/avc1/480x270/NPrK7bXCPCAkMipp.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917257256305115136/vid/avc1/640x360/vFVbigD5s8NsRUJ1.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1917257256305115136/vid/avc1/1280x720/J1quzfepF9KBw5pr.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

In 1995, Steve Jobs gave his most BRUTALLY honest interview  
  
BUT the footage was lost...17 years later it was found in a garage  
  
The "Lost Interview" revealed:  
â€¢ The REAL reason he left Apple  
â€¢ The secret of building amazing products  
  
8 insights that'll leave you speechless:

1/ The REAL reason he left Apple:  
  
"I hired the wrong guy. He destroyed everything I'd spent 10 years working for."  
  
The problem? Sales & marketing took over while product visionaries were pushed aside. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915760259123359744/pl/Uye0ssdraRpGCoyG.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=66b&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915760259123359744/vid/avc1/480x270/gCibYjeXQ7TaqS2k.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915760259123359744/vid/avc1/640x360/xtLkULYy-Dd87xaC.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915760259123359744/vid/avc1/1280x720/OsDWmYcdVgQjYuwE.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

2/ Jobs' hiring philosophy:  
  
"In most of life, difference between average and best is 2:1. With software, it's 50:1."  
  
This is why he only hired "A players" - they attract more A's and reject everyone else. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915760401704480768/pl/Iimd63swoC3fjc67.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=708&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915760401704480768/vid/avc1/480x270/UpaH647KzK1NyZlk.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915760401704480768/vid/avc1/640x360/yTbG-Jret-HP7kEG.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915760401704480768/vid/avc1/1280x720/KRRevoTc677vivlJ.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

In 2006, North Korea printed $45M in fake $100 US bills.  
  
The counterfeits were flawless, experts called them "Supernotes."  
  
This forced the US to add a molecular signature only central banks can verify.  
  
Here are 3 classified features that make US dollars impossible to copy:  

The counterfeiters had gone beyond simple forgery.  
  
North Korea acquired the same Swiss-made Intaglio Color 8 printing press used by the US government.  
  
They sourced identical cotton-linen paper from the same manufacturer.  
  
Even the ink was perfectly matched. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915449277364789249/pl/VFLVBl3_P7BqH0yY.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=a04&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915449277364789249/vid/avc1/480x270/WB7pdpWbWlctDb-B.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915449277364789249/vid/avc1/640x360/pAfQjDbyGv4KXIEb.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915449277364789249/vid/avc1/1280x720/XpeRPaId6xEo5T1l.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>

The 1989 discovery of the first Supernote (code C-14342) in the Philippines started a global hunt.  
  
Five North Korean diplomats were caught with $430,000 in fake bills in Hong Kong.  
  
Behind it all? Office 39 - a secretive unit tasked with raising funds through illegal means. <video controls=""><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915449377470242818/pl/FnMYyHWP7Oc9Afs6.m3u8?tag=14&amp;v=09d&amp;container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915449377470242818/vid/avc1/480x270/JCWYYHR8wV0FIimY.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915449377470242818/vid/avc1/640x360/vH28lUi3QMrGkluG.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><br><source src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1915449377470242818/vid/avc1/1280x720/Jqk91dSDJSk202A0.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"></video>
