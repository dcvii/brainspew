## The Accidental Superpower: The Next Generation of American Preeminence and the Coming Global Disorder

The freshman book of New York Times Bestselling Author of The End of the World is Just the Mapping the Collapse of Globalization.  
An eye-opening assement of American power and deglobalization in the bestselling tradition of The World is Flat and The Next 100 Years.  
Near the end of the Second World War, the United States made a bold strategic gambit that rewired the international system. Empires were abolished and replaced by a global arrangement enforced by the U.S. Navy. With all the world's oceans safe for the first time in history, markets and resources were made available for everyone. Enemies became partners.  
  
We think of this system as normal - it is not. We live in an artificial world on borrowed time.  
  
In The Accidental Superpower, international strategist Peter Zeihan examines how the hard rules of geography are eroding the American commitment to free trade; how much of the planet is aging into a mass retirement that will enervate markets and capital supplies; and how, against all odds, it is the ever-ravenous American economy that - alone among the developed nations - is rapidly approaching energy independence. Combined, these factors are doing nothing less than overturning the global system and ushering in a new (dis)order.  
  
For most, that is a disaster-in-waiting, but not for the Americans. The shale revolution allows Americans to sidestep an increasingly dangerous energy market. Only the United States boasts a youth population large enough to escape the sucking maw of global aging. Most important, geography will matter more than ever in a de-globalizing world, and America's geography is simply sublime.

Peter Zeihan succeeds at providing us with a hugely enjoyable read on what he thinks will shape the world in the coming decades. While he very well might be accurate, one must consider this is a complicated world and not one ruled entirely by geopolitics. My main takeaway was to rethink the forces which made this world what it is today. Having only been alive for 32 years, it's easy for me to forget or cast aside the seemingly-infinite human energy that shaped the planet we current live on — cultivation, civilization, discovery, innovation, war, nature, etc. We live not in a static world but one of fluidity. The recent period of humanity has proven to be a more stable one, arguably thanks in part to post-WWII United States military supremacy and global trade. The US, however, seems to be slowly turning away from engagement with the rest of the world, perhaps resulting in a world with no overarching force of stability. While it’s too soon to know how this will play out, Zeihan argues it will have massive consequences.  
  
While a few other books I’ve read recently (Ian Bremmer’s Superpower and Henry Kissinger’s World Order) expand on this topic, Accidental Superpower does more to point out the likely consequences of changing demography. Countries such as Japan, Russia and China, he thinks, will fare poorly as populations age and production declines. As an example: with far too few ethnic Russians, the state itself will face possible implosion, which Zeihan argues is a reason for recent Russian aggression into regions previously included in the Soviet Union. While it’s again impossible to know the extent of how aging and declining populations will fare in the coming decades, I fear we may be in for a reckoning much like the current global financial crisis only on a potentially much larger scale. It’s easy to be pessimistic and borderline paranoid while considering these possibilities, however, a citizen of the US may take some comfort in Zeihan’s assessment that the United States will fare immensely better than most of the rest of the planet as geographic forces once again take control of global populations; geography being the reason he thinks of the US as an “accidental” superpower to begin with. In short, the US is blessed with far more navigable rivers than anywhere else on earth along with oceans on both sides creating a vast buffer and easy navigation, this in addition to better demographic trends, natural defenses and huge amounts of arable land.  
  
The argument against this book might be that this planet has moved beyond one controlled largely by geography and that cutting-age weapons, advanced communication and easy transportation render the globe one controlled by anyone with best access to these things. Perhaps, as humans tend to do, this thinking is over-confident and we don’t have as much control of our destinies as we’d like to think. Either way, it’s shaping up to be an interesting time to be alive — if you’re into geopolitics at least.

Roughly six months ago, the YouTube algorithm clearly picked up on my penchant for geopolitical content and started feeding me a steady stream of Peter Zeihan. Since then, probably every other video recommended to me features his content. While it tends to be extremely repetitive, it remains a guilty pleasure to listen to his outlook on world affairs (he is very eloquent and charismatic). That said, YouTube tends to be very click-baity and Zeihan’s predictions seem to be very over-the-top (claims like “China as we know it will cease to exist in 10 years”). Wanting to assess his ideas in their full context, I picked up his first book from 2014.  
  
And I will say, I think the first half of the book is simply excellent. There is probably no better primer on the concept of geopolitics (how geography shapes global politics and empires). He clearly explains how rivers (which enable cheap transport), deep water ports and navigation, and eventually industrialization led to rise of every major power in its day (from Egypt and Babylon, to the United Kingdom and Germany, and culminating in the country blessed with near perfect geography, the United States). Again, I cannot praise the first half of this book enough. It is entertaining, engaging, and really educational.  
  
If I had to sum up the thesis of this work, it is that the US harnessed its privileged geography and financial standing in the wake of the destruction wrought by WWII, to grant allies and former adversaries access to American markets, as well as American defensive guarantees, in exchange for following our system and playing by our rules. In many cases, this was a better deal than they ever could have attained through military conquest. This too, I generally tend to agree with (though the author has an annoying habit of referring to this as the Bretton Woods system (which technically ended in 1971 when Nixon severed the dollar’s connection to gold). He really means the Pax Americana, but I get his larger point.  
  
The second major theme of the book is that the world we have known our entire life (at least for me as a Gen Xer), the world brought to us by globalization and cheap consumer goods is about to abruptly end. According to Zeihan, this is a result of two key factors: 1) the world we know was enabled by the post WWII baby boom which produced excess labor and capital and 2) the US is entering a period of retrenchment where we are refusing to continue our role as the global, naval policeman (which is a prerequisite for free global trade).  
  
From these two trends (demographic collapse and US withdrawal), the author makes some pretty wild claims for the end of the world as we know it. While it is hard to disagree with the broad trend lines, where I think he goes wrong, is that he grossly exaggerates the speed and force with which these impacts will occur. The US still has overseas bases in more than 100 countries and while our rhetoric has grown more populist, we have shown little sign of any large scale withdrawal from the world stage. Even with China’s rapid growth, our Navy is still larger, more capable, and more active than ever. And even with the reality of demographic collapse on the horizon, global trade as a whole is not going to disappear overnight. The exaggerated claims of rapid collapse and retrenchment give the author the attention grabbing headlines that accompany personal financial success in the clickbait era of advertising, but they detract from the seriousness of his arguments. He could easily have written the same book, with slower, long term projections (i.e. instead of China’s imminent collapse, he could have said something like, China is about to enter the same type of long-term stagnation that has accompanied Japan as its population aged, and it would have instantly made it much more credible).  
  
The book also leaves out any discussion whatsoever of either culture or nuclear weapons. This is kind of a big deal as those are two huge inputs that could shape his predictions. Written in 2014, some of his predictions do seem rather prophetic (specifically Russia’s aggression in Ukraine). However, others (like Argentina’s emergence as a self-sustaining global power, seem rather overblown (again, largely as a result of neglecting the culture and history of the people who reside there).  
  
Overall, I would still recommend this book, if for nothing else because of how well he defines and explains the influence and impact of geography on global politics. I also like many of his ideas on the future impact of demographics, though I do think he tends to grossly exaggerate the speed with which these trends will be brought to bear on global affairs. Solid 3 stars.

Russia, by contrast, faces no political or alliance constraints on its ability to pursue a strategic policy to its west. However, unlike Turkey, it does face a time pressure; Russia's demographics are so horrid that if it fails to act before 2022, it will lose the capacity to act both militarily and economically. This puts Russia on a collision course with the eight EU members on the edge of what the Russians see as their preferred border zone: Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. It would seem that the Russian challenge to Europe's future is rather obvious.

10% and already the blatant platitudes and omissions of convenience are too much. This book would make Thomas Friedman's mustache blush. Bail.

*The Accidental Superpower* is a compelling read populated with a number of bold claims derived from geopolitical and demographic analysis. The central argument is that as America continually disengages from the Bretton Woods system (post-WWII Pax Americana) the rest of the world will face increasing disorder.  
  
Zeihan states his thesis thusly:  

> The looming crisis of the contemporary system is actually pretty straightforward. Everything that makes the global economy tick—from reliable access to global energy supplies to the ability to sell into the American market to the free movement of capital—is a direct outcome of the ongoing American commitment to Bretton Woods. But the Americans are no longer gaining a strategic benefit from that network, even as the economic cost continues. At some point—maybe next week, maybe ten years from now—the Americans are going to reprioritize, and the tenets of Bretton Woods, the foundation of the free trade order, will simply end.

  
  
or more succinctly, Zeihan predicts:  

> “The dissolution of the free trade order, the global demographic inversion, the collapse of Europe and China."

  
  
The premise for this bold claim, which many will find too bullish on America and too bearish on Eurasia, is America possesses insurmountable advantages due to its geography and demography. Compared to other developed places in the world, American has a better "balance of transport" (i.e. ease of transport within and difficulty of transport beyond) due to its river system and is not struggling with a disproportionately aging population (at least not as starkly as China and Europe).  
  
If most of the empirical assertions check out (I didn't see any glaring errors, though there's are many different ways to approach analyses like these, which can lead to different conclusions), it is hard to disagree with the *general* direction of these claims. I'd bet long on America geopolitically too, but I wouldn't bet on outright collapse in Europe or China.  
  
I think there are a couple clear weaknesses in the Zeihan model. 1) it is primarily a linear extrapolation of prior and current trends. This is fine IF all the important variables are known, measured properly, and unlikely to change. This is a big "if" though... 2) I think geography and demography are incredibly important, but there are other critical civilization-level factors absent from the model, namely technology, culture, and institutional quality. I think technology is likely to be most important player here (everyone talks about AI or the electronics stack), but in many ways innovation and its implementation can be tied to cultural factors and practices and institutional designs. However, both these quasi-omissions (Zeihan does extol the benefits of certain recent innovation like shale fracking) may cut for or against his hypothesis. It is quite possible that adding in terms for innovation, institutions, and cultural factors may predict a greater American advantage.  
  
Regardless, this is more of a serious model than I originally thought it would be. Often times, the popular discussions of Zeihan's writing and commentary make it out to be a bit of a caricature of what it is. Now, he is certainly making bold predictions in casual language, but they're prediction that we will see if they play out or not in the next 10+ years or so. He has certainly been directionally right on a number of things like Russian aggression, though his predictions have also been proved too bearish on China already.  
  
Check out this book. Please highlight any resources that can complicate Zeihan's geographical and demographic claims too. I'm eager to learn more, though am already familiarized with the Mearsheimer/Tooze/Chomskyite realist-type or American declinist type critiques.

Crap for nonsense from a Stratfor alumnus  
  
We have a new Tom "Teapot Tommy"/"My Head Is Flat" Friedman here, and that's not a complement.  
  
I started repeatedly rolling my eyeballs before the end of the first chapter at the number of huge overgeneralizations plus outright inaccuracies.  
  
Speaking of, I stopped reading by page 60 over this:  
  
1\. Claims that Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City were near passes in the Rockies; and  
2\. The claims that Monterey and Chihuahua (City) were the only two "meaningful" Mexican populations near the US border. I guess Tijuana isn't "meaningful" and El Chapo Guzman stole Juarez.  
  
But, per my semi-rhyming title, the author is a Stratfor alum, so this level of inaccurate dreck isn't really a surprise.

I was prepared to be embarrassed by this book. I run a YouTube channel, and on the strength of some rapturous comments from my audience, I listened to maybe 4 or 5 podcast interviews with the author Peter Zeihan. Because people kept asking me about him, earlier this year I published a video where I critiqued what I understood to be his positions. When a bargain priced version of the book jumped out at me at the Strand last week, I was nervous. Would Zeihan's written work make me feel like a chump? Would I have to retract my polite but scathing video?  
  
I'm happy to report that, if anything, my video was way too lenient. This is not a worthless book. Zeihan is an engaging writer, and I got a lot of valuable information from this read. As one example, I think every US declinist should be required to read his passages on the US's almost infinite advantages. Zeihan is a geographer, and his descriptions and maps on that topic are uniformly illuminating. But he shares the weakness of his profession, going back to Halford Mackinder. As a class, these folks are absolutely right that geography is vitally important. But it's not everything, and, as with Mackinder, it's the extrapolations that Zeihan puts on top of his solid geographic knowledge that get him in to trouble.  
  
In my video, I advanced three critiques about Zeihan from his podcasts. 1) He's too close to the oil & gas industry and therefore refuses to recognize the decarbonization juggernaut that's about to eviscerate petroleum producers. 2) His world history knowledge prior to WW2 seems nonexistent and 3) His complete contempt for most political actors, and the assumption that they are guaranteed to be helpless without big daddy America. All three of these faults were very much on display in this book.  
  
On the first front, this book seems to not even acknowledge that renewable energy exists. It's unfair to hold Zeihan accountable for this, however, as the book was published in 2014. For decades renewable energy has been the revolution that never happened. Back in 2014, I too was convinced it was doomed to be a joke forever. That's no longer true.  
  
Zeihan's contempt for a lot of the world's peoples comes through in every chapter. I wouldn't call it racism, just a sort of glib snarkiness, that makes him a very engaging speaker and writer, but I think leads him to underestimate a lot of countries. Africa seems doomed to fail and barely worth mentioning in his eyes, which doesn't match my current sense of all of that continent's 54 countries. His view on China in particular, one of his most famous positions, also seems rooted in a deep sense of contempt.  
  
I don't think Zeihan's descriptions of Chinese history as unending chaos make much sense. Sure, there are periods of great disarray, but many of the "Brief moments" of Chinese unification outlasted all of US history, especially when you consider that we had a civil war just a little over 150 years ago. Zeihan's description of the way that US influence in East Asia has made unprecedented Chinese consolidation possible was very on point, but he seems to leave out industrialization entirely. Yes, China was always limited by its river systems... but now it has trains and highways. Everywhere.  
  
The most glaring issue in this book is its treatment of history. Many commenters argued that I was being unfair to Zeihan, in complaining about the historical ignorance he demonstrated on podcasts. His writing, they assured me, was much better. It is not. Some of these chapters are gobsmackingly ignorant. His description of the pre-American world system is frankly nonsense. There absolutely were nasty mercantilist fights between European empires. But those were largely over by the 1750s, if not the late 1600s, and the British won those fights prettily handily. So handily that after some early failures, even Napoleon had to give up on the world outside Europe. Victorian British statesmen would be appalled by Zeihan's suggestion in this book that the US invented the very idea of "free trade". The world absolutely had a hegemon before the United States, one whose world leadership and failings we should be doing more to learn from. Zeihan seems unaware that the British Empire's world leadership, from 1815 through 1914( or at least the 1880s), even existed.  
  
And Zeihan plays fast and loose with 20th century history as well. I've often been intimidated by Bretton Woods, the gold-based system of fixed exchange rates that governed the world from the 1944 until Nixon ditched the gold standard in 1971. I know it's massive, but I can't quite grasp the significance. Zeihan gets around this entirely by pretending that Bretton Woods is merely the still existing (if shaky) free trade regime set up by the 1947 General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade (GATT) which later evolved into the WTO. Put politely, this is ahistorical nonsense. GATT was an outgrowth of the Bretton Woods System, that survived it, but blithely referring to GATT/WTO as Bretton Woods for half the book is a staggering distortion of history and economics. My understanding from every other work of history I have ever read is that the Bretton Woods system ended in the 1970s. This Bretton Woods thing strikes me as a grave distortion, one so sweeping that I don't just think less of the author, I think less of the publisher and everybody involved in the process who let it get to print.  
  
Prior to reading this book, I had assumed that Zeihan might be more reliable than me when it came to finance and economics. That assumption was wrong. There is a lot in this book about demographics. The fact that most countries in the world are aging rapidly is tremendously important. There are some good suggestions in this book about what the impacts are likely to be. In many cases, I think things may be as dire as Zeihan suggests. But I think Zeihan goes further than pointing out that demographics are important, into a sort of demographics millenarianism.  
  
For Zeihan, Baby boomer retirements don't just mean a shift in investment funds and priorities, they mean an automatic investment apocalypse in every country, taking place in specific years that are perfectly knowable due to each country's demographic structure. This... is not how money works. Yes, if wealth was divided equally among all US baby boomers, who were switching from growth stocks to US treasuries in lockstep on their retirement days, then maybe (probably not) something like what Zeihan describes may be possible. But that's not how wealth works.  
  
Wealth is not evenly distributed. I don't have the figures in front of me, but it's safe to assume that a comfortable majority of the money owned by baby boomers is owned by the top 1-5% of investors who will never want to put large amounts of their money into boring investments. Most wealth is owned by the wealthy. The largest portion of baby boomer wealth, which will become (unless estate tax laws change dramatically) inherited wealth for later generations, is always going to be chasing growth. Again, I don't want to suggest that demographics are not important, or that the baby boomer retail investor's switch to safety might not be important. These are worthwhile dynamics to think about. But they don't guarantee the serial apocalypses (apocalypsi?) that Zeihan predicts.  
  
Honestly I feel kind of bad about this two star review. But the history sections, and the Bretton Woods thing specifically, require it. Zeihan's faulty assumptions about how the world worked before the United States are at the heart of his grand pronouncements about how it might work without our direct involvement. I think Zeihan is a very positive influence generally. His point that the United States is in vastly better shape than the catastrophists of Washington, DC want us to believe is valid, and he makes it with style and verve. But I think he sometimes lets that style and verve take him to places that serve his audience very poorly.
