### The Binary Trap Is A Lie; and Boyd Showed Us How to See It and Maneuver Around It

### LOCAL MAN’S BREAKFAST DISRUPTED IN WEST VILLAGE DINER!

This morning, I was out at breakfast and saw these two newspapers side by side. I stopped eating, took a photo, and knew I had to write this and get this up on *The Whirl* immediately.

This is the kind of thing we’re surrounded by every day. It’s designed to split us. To trap us in a frame.

To make us react instead of think.

It isolates. It prevents dialogue.

It rewards outrage and punishes reflection.

But if you’ve studied Boyd—if you understand the OODA ‘loop’ sketch—you see it for what it is.

This isn’t just media bias.

It’s orientation warfare.

And you need to know how to fight it.

And yes, I satirically used the sensationalist “BREAKING” in the title with intent.

### Look At This Photo:

### Two headlines. Same event.

**New York Post:***“ **COLUMBIA UNMASKED** – University **FINALLY** agrees to ban on face covers after Trump’s $400 million threat.”*

**Daily News:***“ **COLUMBIA CAVES TO TRUMP** – Makes concessions on masks, security and negotiations with feds over $400M funding.”*

Both papers are screaming.

Both want you locked into a team.

Both are offering you a feeling, not a frame of thinking.

And both could be wrong.

### This Is Why You Need To Understand Boyd Authentically

John Boyd didn’t create the OODA ‘loop’ sketch to win arguments. He built it to help you see. To orient. To reorient. To stop being manipulated.

Most people think OODA is linear. Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. It’s not.

Boyd’s actual sketch is nonlinear.

It loops, spirals, feeds back on itself.

It’s not a process. It’s a fight for perception.

Orientation is the core.

Your Orientation decides what you see, what you value, and what actions you take.

### Binary Framing Is (more often than not) the Fastest Way to Lose

Here’s what both headlines do:

Collapse complexity into a soundbite.

Replace system-level thinking with emotional bait.

Give you a binary: “finally” vs “caves.”

But it’s the same trick, two costumes.

Same frame.

Same trap.

If you believe one and hate the other, you’ve already been maneuvered. Your thinking’s been outsourced. Your Orientation is frozen.

### Boyd’s World Is the Real World

In Boyd’s world:

There’s no clean narrative.

There’s no symmetrical field.

Everyone is maneuvering.

Speed of reorientation wins—not righteousness.

That’s what most people miss.

The world is not left vs. right.

It’s adaptive vs. rigid.

Fast vs. slow.

Conceptual vs. binary.

### You Have to Think Like This Now

If you don’t learn to think conceptually—Boyd-style—you will keep falling for headlines like these.

You will:

React instead of assess.

Collapse nuance into teams.

Fight the wrong war.

And worse—you won’t even know it’s happening.

### Start Here

Read *“Destruction and Creation.”*

Study the full OODA sketch—not the corporate slide version.

Dive into Chapter 7 of Osinga’s *Science, Strategy and War.*

That’s the map.

That’s how you get free.

### Final Point

You’re not living in a battle of sides.

You’re living in a battle of systems.

And the only way out is to reorient faster than they can frame you.

Train your Orientation.

Move faster.

Think harder.

Don’t fall for the traps.

### BONUS EXTRAS:

### This Is the Battlefield of the Mind — And These Are the 10 Books That Will Keep Your Team From Getting Played

If you lead a team, shape strategy, or operate anywhere near power—understand this:

You are in an information war.

Every headline, feed, email, and media cycle is designed to collapse complexity, weaponize emotion, and force you into a box. The binary box. Left vs. Right. Good vs. Evil. Us vs. Them.

That’s not analysis. That’s cognitive control.

And if you don’t have a team that can think across that battlefield—fast, adaptive, and unscripted—you lose.

That’s why this list exists. These 10 books are not for passive reading. They are orientation tools. Influence weapons. Decision accelerators.
