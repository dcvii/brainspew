My quick take on what happened in the Oval Office today.

Trump's offer reframes support for Ukraine as a commercial transaction, which is why he sent Bessent (Treasury secretary) to propose the initial offer to Zelenskyy while simultaneously sending Rubio (Secretary of State) to reassure European allies (quietly, until some European officials leaked it to the press).

The deal was close, but then Zelenskyy went off script.

To understand what happened, Trump views the whole thing more like Yalta, and in his mind, it doesn't work unless Putin can save face. Recall that FDR was no fan of Stalin.

We can criticize Trump's strategy—perhaps Putin shouldn't be given the opportunity to save face. Maybe we should view Putin more like Hitler at the beginning of WWII than Stalin at the end of it. Either way, it's essential to understand what Trump's strategy is, and the media is doing a terrible job of that.

First, let's look at the exchange in the Oval Office, then let's look at Trump's likely strategy.

Trump: "Well, if I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal. You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say, hi, Vladimir. How are we doing on the deal? It doesn't work that way. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world, I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with. You see, the hatred he's got for Putin that's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate. He's got tremendous hatred, and I understand that, but I can't tell you the other side is exactly in love with you know him, either. So it's not a question of alignment. I have to I'm in line with the world. I want to get the thing said. I'm aligned with Europe. I want to see if we can get this thing done. You want me to be tough? I could be tougher than any human being you've ever seen. I'd be so tough, but you're never going to get it done that way. So that's the way it goes. One more question."

Vance: "I will respond to this. So look, for four years, the United States of America, we had a president who stood up the press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin, and then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country. The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy. We tried the pathway of Joe Biden of thumbing our chest and pretending that the President of the United States' words mattered more than the President of the United States' actions. What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That's what President Trump's doing."

Zelenskyy: "Can I ask you?"

Vance: "Sure? Yeah."

Zelenskyy: "He (Putin) occupied our parts, big parts of Ukraine, part of East and Crimea. So he occupied in 2014. so during a lot of years. So I not speaking about just President Obama, then President Trump, then President Obama, now President Trump, God bless now President Trump will stop him. But during 2015 nobody stopped him. He just occupied and took. He killed people."

Trump: "I was not here."

Zelenskyy: "Yes. But during 2014 till 2022. The situation the same that people are been dying on the contact line. Nobody stopped him. You know that we have conversations with him, a lot of conversation, many bilateral conversation, and we signed with him.. In 2019 I signed with him, the deal, I signed with him, Macron and Merkel, we signed ceasefire. Ceasefire. All of them told me that he will never go. We signed him, gas contract. Gas contract, yes, but after that, he broke the ceasefire. He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it. What kind of diplomacy JD you are speaking about? What do you mean?"

Vance: "I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country, Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect. I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems, you should be thanking the president for trying to bring it into this."

Zelenskyy: "Have you ever been to Ukraine that you see what problems we have?"

Zelenskyy is telling the truth. But the truth isn't always the way you get the deal. Had FDR told the truth about Stalin in February of 1945 at Yalta, WWII might not have ended. (Gen. Patton and others wanted FDR to tell the truth, so there is an alternate history to consider.)

Look, I'd rather have the Biden 10-year bilateral security agreement back. But let me steel-man the Trump position. One of the fascinating aspects of the proposal is it would fall under the jurisdiction of a U.S. federal court in NYC (not the WTO or some international body).

The establishment of U.S. contract rights to Ukrainian mineral deposits through a New York federal court jurisdiction would create several important precedents and leverage points:

[1] By establishing contract rights under U.S. jurisdiction, this would create a formal legal mechanism to challenge Russian control of these resources. Any Russian attempt to exploit these deposits could potentially be challenged as interference with U.S. contractual rights, opening avenues for sanctions or other legal remedies through the U.S. judicial system.

[2] The recognition of Ukraine's right to enter into contracts regarding these resources implicitly reinforces Ukraine's territorial sovereignty. This creates an interesting legal paradox where Russia may have physical control of the territory, but Ukraine retains internationally recognized legal authority over its resources. This strengthens Ukraine's position in any future negotiations about territorial control.

[3] The arrangement would give the U.S. a direct economic stake in the resolution of the conflict, potentially increasing American institutional and corporate pressure for the eventual return of these territories to Ukrainian control. This economic interest could translate into sustained political pressure beyond any particular administration.

[4] Such an agreement could establish a template for other nations to similarly secure rights to Ukrainian resources under their own legal jurisdictions, creating a web of international contracts that collectively challenge Russian control. This would make it increasingly difficult for Russia to legitimize or monetize its occupation.

[5] If Putin wants to normalize relations with the West or seek sanctions relief in the future, he would potentially need to address these contract rights. This creates a specific legal hurdle that goes beyond general diplomatic disagreements about territorial control.

Moreover, this contractual framework could provide Ukraine with immediate economic benefits even before regaining physical control of its territory. The ability to enter into binding agreements about these resources affirms Ukraine's economic sovereignty and could potentially help secure financing or investment based on future resource rights.

The specification of New York federal court jurisdiction is particularly significant because of the court's experience with international commercial disputes and its strong protection of property rights. This choice of venue would give the agreement additional credibility and enforceability in the international business community.

This legal-economic approach to challenging territorial occupation represents an innovative form of leverage that combines commercial law with geopolitical strategy (Art of the Deal?). Rather than relying solely on diplomatic pressure or military aid, it creates concrete legal and economic obstacles to Russian control while reinforcing Ukraine's sovereign rights through established international commercial frameworks.

This isn't the strategy I voted for, but it seems to be Trump's. And it depends upon allowing Putin to save face publicly while sending the message—through commercial law—that the U.S. and the world will never accept that most of the Ukrainian territory Russia currently occupies is legitimately Russia's.

Zelenskyy torpedoed that strategy. Let's hope the Europeans have his back. But I've learned not to expect much from them.
