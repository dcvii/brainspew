### This week’s science bits from SWTG

### How Large Language Models Think

A super interesting study from Anthropic looked at the reasoning chains of Claude 3.5 Haiku for various tasks. One of the examples is the addition that Claude does by using a sort of heuristic approximation using known results. When asked, however, it will claim that it did it with mental arithmetic similar to that which humans use. Another example is how hallucinations happen. It seems to be a failure of the model to recognize that it does not know the answer to a question. Read the full study [here](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html).

### Opposition to CERNs Mega-Collider Plan Increases

CERN is expected to put forward detailed plans for their Future Circular Collider (FCC) in the next few weeks, and journalists finally found some physicists willing to speak out against this insanity. I mean, other than me. [In an interview with Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00793-x), particle physicist Ruben Saakyan says that “People inside the community do say \[the FCC\] is really the current \[Director General’s\] vision which has been pushed forward.” According to the same article: “Some researchers told Nature they felt pressured to back the FCC to help present a unified front to the outside world.”

This does not remotely surprise me, seeing as I have been accused of being “anti-science” for pointing out that physics would be better off if the money were invested into more promising research areas like quantum information or new accelerator technologies that could shrink particle colliders back down to a reasonable size.  
  
The FCC, which would likely cost more than $40 billion, wouldn’t be in full operation until the mid 2070s. In my opinion, it would be a huge mistake to tie so much money into a megaproject that is unlikely to benefit anyone besides particle physicists, and by the time it’s built might be obsolete already.  
  
CERN’s annual funding is not sufficient to finance the FCC. They are planning to increase member state contributions, but still need several billion dollars on top of that. It is currently unclear where that money is supposed to come from.  
  
[A member of the German ministry for science and education said already last year that Germany isn’t going to pick up the bill](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01671-8), quite possibly because Germany [is choking on their own collider project that is 10 years beyond schedule and by now a stunning €3 billion above budget.](https://www.steuerzahler-hessen.de/neuigkeiten/artikel/unfaire-kostensteigerung/) Last month, [400 French scientists signed a petition against the FCC](https://www.liberation.fr/idees-et-debats/tribunes/il-faut-renoncer-au-futur-mega-collisionneur-de-particules-du-cern-par-400-scientifiques-20250225_5XHFW4JKRNFPDJTH52UF3B5PR4/).

### Copenhagen Still Rules

A survey at a physics conference last year with 85 respondents revealed that among the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, the Copenhagen interpretation is still the most popular, with 28% favoring it, followed by Many Worlds with 11% (though I would argue that “no opinion,” with 33%, is as popular as the Copenhagen interpretation). The survey also found that hybrid models of dark matter (some combination of modified gravity and particle dark matter) have become the most popular candidate.
