### The great divergence is at hand—and you must choose

Do you remember that scene in *The Matrix*, when Keanu Reeves has to choose between the red pill and the blue pill?

Of course you do. That’s because this meme gets referenced constantly. It feels like it crystallizes so much of what’s happening right now.

There’s good reason for that. Binary oppositions drive everything in society. Even if you try to avoid them, you can’t. You get dragged into a world where you must pick sides. You must decide between the two teams—which one will you join?

You never get more than two options. Have you noticed that?

Maybe it has always been that way. We see binary conflicts defining society going back to the dawn of recorded history—you can read about them in Herodotus and Thucydides.

But this tendency for fault lines to split into two is even older than the history books. Just consider the case of those two contentious siblings, Cain and Abel. Even back then, there were just two sides to the conflict.

That has never changed. Even World Wars and Cold Wars are just binary oppositions. And, of course, politics.

Just consider the [crazy divide between blue and green in ancient Rome](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/while-rome-collapsed-the-citizens). From our perspective, this battle—which started as a conflict between two chariot racing teams with different colors—makes no sense. It obviously caused more harm than good, but continued for a thousand years.

Here’s a link if you want to learn more. The similarity with our own situation is uncanny and disturbing.

We look back at this and laugh at the opponents—who fought each other instead of pushing back against authoritarian leaders. But are we any smarter in our own polarized encampments?

But today I want to focus on the new divergence. And it’s not the one you’re thinking about.

This is a new binary opposition, but currently in its early stages. Yet it may turn out to be the most significant dividing line for the next generation.

For better or worse, this will be the new red-pill-versus-blue-pill choice. You can’t avoid it, and (as always) there are just two options. For your own protection, you need to start noticing this right now.

You already belong to one of the two teams. And you can figure out which side you’re on by answering these eight questions.

## THE EIGHT QUESTIONS

Let’s start with the simplest question of them all:

> **Do you prefer to live in the real world or the virtual world?**

Just like in *The Matrix,* that may be the defining question for the next generation. But this leads directly to another decision:

> **Do you want to think for yourself, or would you rather let bots think for you?**

Here’s another twist on the same theme:

> **Do you want to choose, or would you like an algorithm to choose for you?**

Or on a larger scale:

> **Do you use technology or does technology use you?**

On a more personal level, the question might be framed this way:

> **Do you want the fabric of your life to be people, places and things—or just various apps?**

In economic terms, this translates into:

> **Do you want to be the customer or the product getting sold?**

Or let’s phrase it in narrative terms:

> **Are you the protagonist of your life, making your own decisions. Or will you live a** ***Brave New World*** **kind of passive existence where the burdens of agency are removed from most of your hours?**

Or let’s talk in terms of skills:

> **Do you want to develop skills in reading, writing, analysis, thinking—or would you prefer to skip over all that** ***boring*** **stuff, avoiding all those painful responsibilities?**

These are all variants of the same binary opposition. And there are many other ways of describing the stark difference between these two views of human existence and purpose.

This is even more pressing than left-versus-right, because we rarely have much power in that conflict. We can pick sides in the voting booth at long intervals, but our impact is diluted by all those other voters.

The truth is that our choices have very little influence in politics. And if we want, we can avoid political involvement altogether—and that avoidance won’t have much impact on society or ourselves.

Such avoidance is not possible with technology. You can’t hide from it—it seeks you out even in your most private moments. And so you must make a choice. And you must do so again and again, day after day.

You can try to find a balance, but even the middle way will involve some distancing from the all-consuming goals of the technocracy—with its desire to swallow up all human vocations and activities. And not just in the workplace or communal life but even in the most intimate hidden corners of home and hearth.

That’s why you can’t sit on the fence, and hope to find a balance between the real and the virtual world. Even the fence will soon get consumed by encroaching tech.

So make no mistake, this will be the fundamental divide in the future, and especially for the rising generation.

The rest of us have already developed a skill base for human encounters. We remember life before smartphones, or (some of us) even before the Internet. But a child today may need to fight for the privilege of living in a real word.

That’s why we can already see this divergence among youngsters.

A [new survey of 20,000 youths](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/10/children-limiting-own-smartphone-use-manage-mental-health-survey) reveals that 40% now voluntarily limit their smartphone time—up sharply from 18% in 2022.

That’s a huge change in just three years. And it tells us that we may soon reach a 50/50 divide between the two camps in the battle between who those who want to live in the world, and those who stare into screens.

Readers sometimes accuse me of being too optimistic. They think I’m sugar-coating reality—especially because so much of my writing focuses on stagnation and degradation.

How can I possibly be cheerful in the face of all this?

I certainly see the dangers we face. I don’t want to minimize them.

But my optimism is built on these undeniable truths:

1. **Each of us still possesses some degree of agency** —we don’t need to live a passive app-driven life.
2. **The risks of abandoning agency are increasingly evident to the general public**. The surveys make this clear. With each passing month, people are becoming more resistant to tech encroachment on their lives.
3. **A backlash is clearly and unambiguously underway.** And although it hasn’t gotten much support from CEOS and political leaders (who many be compromised by financial incentives), the clamor of complaint and opposition from the public will be felt.
4. **Many individuals—almost half of the public, by my estimate—have already made a wise choice.** They have lost faith in the technocracy. They have been effectively red-pilled, and from this point on, they can’t un-see what they have seen.
5. **These people may fail in their attempts to change the system, but they can’t be stopped.** Nothing prevents them from taking effective measures in their own personal spheres of existence and influence.

In other words, anyone who really wants to be saved can be saved. There’s room for everybody on this Noah’s Ark—you just need to want to avoid the coming flood.

So I am guardedly optimistic.

That said, I am not complacent. The over-reaching of the tech overlords is so great and their worship of their AI faux deity so extreme that they may try to force everyone into compliance.

That’s what religious zealots always do in extreme cases—history tells us that. They are no longer satisfied with proselytizing and try impose total control. If they get their way, nobody can escape on Noah’s Ark.

In politics, this is called authoritarianism. In the tech world, it’s described as *disabling the opt-out function.* That sounds innocent enough, but it really isn’t.

We are fortunate that tech billionaires don’t have the power yet to impose the AI equivalent of a theocracy. But this could change. So we still need to remain engaged in the battle, and use all the tools available to us to ensure that a demonstrably human life is still accessible in the future—real, whole, healthy, and not enslaved to dopamine drip-delivery from a device

But the opening step is to make a right decision in the great divergence now at hand.

Do you want the red pill or blue pill? The choice is up to you.
