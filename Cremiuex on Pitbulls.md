There is no reason to keep pit bull type dogs legal, but there is plenty of reason to ban them.  
  
They are extremely disproportionately likely to bite and to kill. Keeping them around serves no purpose.

Pit bull owners are disproportionately likely to be mentally ill, to have criminal records, to be low-income and poorly-educated, etc.  
  
But this doesn't explain the breed's issues. Even when they were not the premiere fighters, they dominated injury stats  
  

It's also worth noting that, despite not being the most common type of dog in New York City, pit bulls still commit the largest share of the dog bites:

I've seen people mentioning that Europe's heat-related death issue is larger than American gun violenceâ€”true!  
  
But people neglect saying how many heat-related deaths America has.  
  
Approximately 1% of what Europe does even though America is hotter and Americans are less healthy!

Those factors mean Americans are more at-risk for heat-related deaths, even after accounting for Europe being a little older than America.  
  
So let's be clear:  
  
Europeans die from heat at relatively high rates; Americans survive it with technology.  

What technology?  
  
It's the terraforming technology of air conditioning.  
  
Install A/C and the heat-related deaths will mostly disappear, if Europe can keep their grid operational.

Phenotyping is the vast, minimally-explored frontier in genome-wide association studies.  
  
Important threadðŸ§µ  
  
Briefly, phenotyping is how you measure people's traits. Measure poorly, get bad results; measure well, get good results.  
  
Example? Janky knees.

The janky knee example refers to osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, which occurs when the cartilage between bones is worn down, so bones start rubbing against each other.  
  
This ends up being very painful.

Everyone with this condition isn't necessarily diagnosed with it.  
  
This is especially true for men, who tend to just ignore this (and many other conditions) more often than women do.  
  
This is, in a word, annoying, because it means that if you study it, sampling is likely biased.
