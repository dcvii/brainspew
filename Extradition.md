I hear that the new FBI director has arrested all of the FBI top ten most wanted. True?

- Donald Eugene Fields II, arrested on January 25, 2025, in Florida, wanted for child sex trafficking and child rape charges.
- Arnoldo Jimenez, arrested on January 30, 2025, in Mexico, wanted for first-degree murder.
- Francisco Javier Roman-Bardales, arrested in Mexico and extradited to the U.S., announced on March 18, 2025, for his alleged role as a senior MS-13 gang leader involved in violence, drug distribution, and extortion.

What are the countries for which the US has no extradition treaty such that fugitives might remain at large?

1. China: Lacks an extradition treaty with the U.S. due to political and legal differences. China restricts extradition of its nationals and has a history of refusing U.S. requests, making it a potential haven for fugitives. However, economic and diplomatic pressures can lead to case-by-case cooperation.
2. Russia: The Russian Constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens, and no formal treaty exists with the U.S. Political tensions further reduce the likelihood of cooperation, as seen in the case of Edward Snowden, who has resided in Russia since 2013.
3. Cuba: No extradition treaty exists, and historically, Cuba has not cooperated with U.S. requests due to strained diplomatic relations. It has served as a refuge for some fugitives, though recent U.S.-Cuba talks on law enforcement could shift dynamics.
4. Iran: Political conflicts and the absence of diplomatic relations make extradition to the U.S. virtually impossible. Iran has no treaty and rarely cooperates on international legal matters.
5. North Korea: With no diplomatic relations or extradition treaty, North Korea is effectively closed to U.S. extradition requests. Its isolationist policies make it a theoretical haven, though practical challenges limit its appeal.
6. Saudi Arabia: No formal extradition treaty exists, and requests are handled on a discretionary, diplomatic basis. Cooperation is limited, often influenced by political considerations, though Saudi Arabia has expressed reluctance to be a safe haven for fugitives.
7. United Arab Emirates (UAE): Despite some sources suggesting a treaty since 1999, enforcement is inconsistent, particularly for financial crimes. The UAE has cooperated in high-profile cases (e.g., Hushpuppi in 2020), but its discretionary approach can delay or prevent extradition.
8. Vietnam: No formal treaty exists, though Vietnam has considered extradition on an ad hoc basis. Its legal system and sovereignty concerns make extradition unlikely without significant diplomatic pressure.
9. Montenegro: This Balkan nation has no extradition treaty with the U.S. and generally prohibits extraditing its nationals, though it has cooperated with other countries (e.g., Serbia) under specific agreements. Its appeal lies in its stability and lifestyle.
10. Ecuador: No formal treaty exists, and Ecuador has a history of refusing U.S. extradition requests, particularly for political or human rights reasons. It remains relatively stable compared to other South American non-extradition countries like Venezuela.
11. Venezuela: Lacks a treaty and frequently refuses U.S. requests due to political hostility. However, its ongoing economic and political crisis makes it less attractive for fugitives.
12. African Nations:
	- Ethiopia, Botswana, Uganda: These countries have no extradition treaties with the U.S. and may serve as refuges, though their cooperation with Interpol can lead to deportations or case-by-case extraditions.
	- Somalia, Eritrea, South Sudan: Political instability and lack of centralized governance make extradition unlikely, but these are not practical havens due to security concerns.
	- Morocco: No formal treaty, though a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty exists, and Morocco occasionally cooperates informally. Its residency-by-investment programs attract some seeking refuge.
13. Other Notable Countries:
	- Brunei: No treaty, and its strict legal system prioritizes sovereignty. It’s a stable but less common destination.
	- Moldova, Ukraine: These Eastern European nations lack treaties, but Ukraine’s U.S. alignment may lead to informal cooperation, especially post-2022.
	- Qatar, Bahrain, Oman: Gulf states with no treaties, where extradition is handled diplomatically and often refused unless aligned with national interests.

Important Considerations

- Case-by-Case Cooperation: Even without treaties, countries like Vietnam, Morocco, or the UAE may extradite based on diplomatic relations, Interpol Red Notices, or mutual legal assistance agreements. For example, Montenegro arrested Terraform Labs’ Do Kwon in 2023 despite no U.S. treaty, showing that international pressure can override non-extradition status.
- Human Rights and Political Factors: Some countries refuse extradition to protect individuals from perceived unfair treatment, political persecution, or human rights abuses (e.g., China, Russia). Others, like Ecuador, may grant asylum for similar reasons.
- Citizenship and Residency Programs: Countries like Vanuatu, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Dominica offer citizenship-by-investment, which can provide legal protections against extradition, especially for nationals.
- Risks of Reliance: Fugitives relying on non-extradition status face risks, as regimes change, and informal agreements can lead to unexpected extraditions. For instance, the UAE’s cooperation in the Hushpuppi case surprised many who viewed it as a safe haven.
- Interpol and Deportation: Non-extradition countries may still arrest fugitives under Interpol notices or deport them for immigration violations, indirectly facilitating U.S. custody.
- Limited Travel: International surveillance and Interpol notices restrict movement.
- Financial Constraints: Sanctions or frozen assets can limit resources.
- Local Laws: Some countries (e.g., Iran, North Korea) have harsh legal systems or political risks, making them undesirable.
- Diplomatic Shifts: New treaties or political changes can alter a country’s stance, as seen with improving U.S.-Cuba relations.
