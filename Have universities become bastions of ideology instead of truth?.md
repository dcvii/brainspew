*I recently participated in a Doha Debate on whether universities have become bastions of ideology instead of truth ([link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rp3rZlBY-Q)). Here are the notes I brought in case they are interesting or useful to anyone:*

**Context:** A discussion involving me, Omer Bartov, Mohamad Fadel and Pablo Avelluto hosted by Doha Debates in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The format is meant to be a traditional majlis-style discussion aimed at truth seeking (majlis means “sitting room”).

**Discussion Prompt:** Have universities become bastions of ideology instead of truth? Have universities abandoned their core mission of truth-seeking in favor of ideological conformity?

**My thoughts:** As I see it we are being asked to consider two issues: (1) Is there ideological conformity at universities? (2) If yes, does this negatively impact their core mission of truth-seeking? I am a scientist, so I suggest starting the discussion by looking at data. I only really know about the American situation and will focus on it.

1. *We have extensive evidence for ideological conformity at universities.*
	1. The most straight-forward measure of ideology is political party affiliation. Among the public there are roughly the same number of registered Republicans and Democrats. Overall among faculty there are 8.5 registered Democrats for every 1 registered Republican (Langbert 2018; Langbert and Stevens 2021), but this distribution is highly dependent on field. For example, these studies couldn’t find a single registered Republican in anthropology and communications. Art, sociology, English, and religion all have D:R ratios of more than 40:1, meaning that you would have to go to 4-5 universities to find a single Republican in many of these areas. Critically, these are areas where political perspective might actually influence scholarly output. In most hard sciences the D:R ratio is 5-6:1 and in engineering it is 3:2. There is no field where Republicans outnumber Democrats.
	2. 17% of faculty self-identify as radical (Honeycutt 2022 thesis). So you do see some restricted ideological non-conformity ranging from leftwing to far-left radicals on campus. But even mildly conservative perspectives are rarely present at all, especially in the humanities and social sciences, and usually met with contempt.
1. *Does this ideological disparity disrupt truth-seeking, the core mission of universities?*
	1. In the humanities and social sciences the answer is clearly yes. Ideological conformity is much larger in these fields, and they are less objective so these are the fields where ideological conformity can cause the most problems.
	2. For example: 22% of faculty self-identify as activists (Honeycutt 2022 thesis). Note that a self-identifying activist is openly declaring that he has abandoned the core mission of truth-seeking, so it is shocking that 22% of faculty do this. These faculty are often motivated by the spirit Marx expresses in *Theses on Feuerbach*: “The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.” Agree or disagree with this perspective, it is clearly a deviation from the stated mission of truth seeking.
	3. Consider the Department of Race, Diaspora, and Indigeneity at the University of Chicago, “The Department of Race, Diaspora, and Indigeneity (RDI) is dedicated to investigating, **interrupting**, and **challenging** the historical and social processes, the cultural and political practices, and the formations of identity and community that are integral to these three concepts.” This is the first sentence of their website, and it makes it clear that they are not playing the truth-seeking game. This is a particularly explicit and obvious example, but it is typical of what has happened across the humanities and social sciences. I was on the elected faculty council that approved the formation of this department. It was quite obvious that its purpose was activist, not scholarly, and I argued strongly against creating the department. Nevertheless it was approved by a vote of ~90%. This is a direct result of the leftwing ideological bias of the faculty. If something sounds “social justicy” it typically gets approved, accepted, funded, etc., even if it is obviously not about the pursuit of truth, the stated purpose of the university. Note that this is not a uniquely leftwing problem. If the faculty were 90% conservative, I think you would have activist departments approved for being patriotic and shoddy papers and grants funded that supported all sorts conservative ideas. We need more ideological balance among the faculty to avoid this type of silliness and remain focused on the pursuit of truth.
	4. In the hard sciences I do not think truth-seeking has been completely disrupted, but it has been affected. For example I have seen published articles and lectures at conferences advocating for “feminist geosciences” and “post-colonial physics.” This is an explicit call to replace truth seeking with an ideological project. More generally, the DEI project is an effort to enforce ideological conformity even in the sciences and even in the questions asked and answers found. It is essential that DEI continue to be resisted and ultimately be defeated to preserve intellectual integrity at universities.

**If Israel-Palestine comes up:** It is a tragedy when anyone is killed. I have sympathy for both sides and complex feelings on the issue. I’ve visited the Weizmann institute four times and have deep respect for my Israeli colleagues. I have also worshiped with Arabs many times in St George church in Lydda and lectured at Birzeit University outside Ramallah, so I’ve had some exposure to the perspectives of both sides of the conflict.

What do the data say about whether there is ideological conformity on campus on this issue and how this has affected our ability to seek truth? According to the FIRE campus deplatforming database, there have been 526 campus deplatforming events since 2022. Of these 203, or 39%, have involved the Israel-Palestine conflict. Of deplatformed speakers on this issue, 84, or 41%, were advocating a pro-Isreal perspective and 119, or 59%, were advocating a pro-Palestine perspective. I don’t know the base rate of invitations from each perspective so I can’t say whether there is a significant bias in the probability of a speaker from either perspective being de-platformed. What is clear is that the Israel-Palestine conflict is currently one of the most contentious issues on campus, that both sides are well-represented on campus, and that both sides are doing a lot of deplatforming of views they disagree with.

**If the Trump administration comes up:** I am not a member of the Trump administration and have no knowledge of their internal thinking. When I look at the agreements they are making with universities I see mostly standard stuff that all advocates of academic freedom should support: efforts to establish clear time, place, and manner restrictions to promote academic freedom and prevent violence. There are a few parts that start to look like “DEI for Jews” which I do not support. Hearing a perspective or argument you disagree with is not harassment, and the two should not be conflated.
