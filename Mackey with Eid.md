I was the guest of a Bedouin named Eid (R) this evening. My new friend Amos (to my R) whom my new friend Aran (to my left) introduced me to, set up the visit. Eid's father, who is in his 90s, is on the left.  
  
Eid hosted us in his Shig, a traditional hospitality tent. Anyone can show up and take refuge in a Shig and the tribe/family will host them there, feeding them and letting them sleep there, for 3 days. After that, the guest will be questioned as to their identity and needs and the council will determine what to do about them.  
  
Eid first served us sweet tea that was warming in a kettle in the coals of the fire. Then he roasted fresh green coffee beans in a skillet over the fire. Bedouin hosts always roast the coffee in the presence of the guest in order to demonstrate that it's not some old, stale coffee, but good fresh, freshly roasted coffee.  
  
After the coffee was roasted he had one of his 7 sons, who had also gathered around, to grind it. Then he brewed it in a distinctive kettle in the coals of the fire. Finally, he served it, giving each of us a cup that was half full. Amos informed me that if he had given us a full cup, that would have been a sign that he considered us enemies. Apparently a cup with two little coffee in it means something dire, too. If you are being hosted by a Bedouin, you want to get a half full cup of coffee!  
  
Following the coffee, dinner was served on two huge platters. One platter was for Eid's family, but of course only the male members. We never saw Eid's two wives or any other female member of the family. They have their own place to be. I believe they cooked the dinner. One of the massive platters was for me and my friends, and the other platter was for the family. We all ate with our hands straight from the platter. The base of the food was rice with pita bread. More or less cooked into it. It was topped by a delicious medley of vegetables, including carrots, peas, and potatoes, as well as chicken. Amos asked Eid why he was not eating, and he said because he was doing something else, that is, he was busy hosting.  
  
Aran told me that every conversation between a Bedouin host and guests proceeds through three levels. First there is small talk. Then more substantial issues are discussed. And finally family and friends are discussed.  
  
In the course of the conversation, Eid told us about his experience of October 7th. The Hamas attackers ran off with his livestock, including his prized black goats. The Bedouin are trackers, and apparently Eid is a great one, because he teaches tracking to young Israelis and is called upon by the IDF and the police when they need someone or something tracked. He and some other Bedouin tracked a couple of the Hamas attackers down. They tortured them and sent them back to Gaza with a message. If the livestock were not returned, it would go very badly for the Hamas members who took the animals. Bedouin from different tribes communicate with each other over great distances, and it would be no problem for Eid to get the message to Bedouin in Gaza, who could be relied upon to kill the people who took his livestock. Needless to say, the livestock were soon returned.  
  
There's plenty more to tell about our conversation, including the fact that Eid makes flutes and played one for us after dinner. Maybe I'll do another post about it.
