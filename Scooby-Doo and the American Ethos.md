***Welcome to Things Worth Remembering, our weekly column in which writers share a poem or a paragraph that all of us should commit to heart. This week, Liel Leibovitz marks the spooky season with a tribute to Scooby-Doo—and explains why the classic cartoon offers one of the most enduring windows into the American soul.***

True American classics are rarely celebrated upon first release. *Moby-Dick* sold shockingly few copies in its first four months, earned its author the measly sum of $1,260, and proceeded to hurry out of print, where it remained for the last years of Herman Melville’s life. *Citizen Kane* lost money in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, prompting one distributor in Emporium, Pennsylvania to muse that, “You can stand in front of a mirror and call yourself ‘sucker’ when you play this one. It does not have one redeeming feature. It will not draw; those that do come will not know what it is all about.” *The Velvet Underground & Nico* never made it past number 171 on the Billboard 200 chart during the year it was released.

To this august list, add “A Night of Fright Is No Delight.”

The 16th episode of the first season of *Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!* is, admittedly, on few critics’ list of cultural touchstones. It should be: Together with a handful of other episodes of the classic Hanna-Barbera cartoon, it is as pure a distillation as any we’ve got of the rowdy, gritty, and good spirit that animates America.

The claim is a weighty one to lay on any pop culture confection, especially one that’s been running more or less uninterrupted for 56 years and has experienced its share of artistic nadirs—for a taste of those, just Google “Scrappy-Doo.” But surrender to the episode in question, and its charms will do the explaining.

The plot, as always, is both delightfully simple and ridiculously convoluted. The cowardly Great Dane, having displayed some unlikely fit of courage, finds himself mentioned in the will of one Colonel Beauregard Sanders. But there is, naturally, a twist: To receive his portion of the million-dollar inheritance, he must spend the night in an exceedingly creepy mansion.

Off the gang goes, and it doesn’t take long for some spooky specter to make himself known. In this case, he’s called the Phantom Shadow, and he’s a green apparition with fiery eyes and chains for bling. Oh, and there are two of him.

If you’re the sort of person who always turns to the last page before diving into a good mystery, I’ll save you the trouble: The Phantoms are really the colonel’s lawyers, which is obvious from the very first moment we meet them—and from the fact that they are named Cosgood Creeps and Cuthbert Crawls. But before you accuse the Mystery Inc. gang of lacking all subtlety, consider the following: The colonel is named after the officer who issued the order that started the Civil War.

Which is why it makes sense that the creepy mansion comes complete with an extensive collection of Civil War memorabilia. As does the reveal at the end that Scooby’s massive inheritance is paid in Confederate dollars, making it more or less worthless.

Screw your eyes just so, and you’re looking at a 21-minute and 53-second animated adaptation of Edmund Wilson’s magnum opus *[Patriotic Gore](https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780393312560)*, a meditation on the Lost Cause of the South. Wilson famously—and controversially—denied the Union its claim to exclusive moral superiority, and sympathetically explored not only the Confederacy’s competing mythology of Southern states protecting their rights from the federal government but also the ways in which this mythology continues to haunt the American popular imagination. *Scooby-Doo* took that haunting literally, with the ghosts of the Confederacy rising up and demanding to be, if not exonerated, then at least reckoned with.

Not many shows can claim to do that *and* throw in a few sandwich-related gags to boot. And even fewer can propose that we take another, more nuanced look at the Civil War when another, second civil war seemed imminent. The episode aired on January 10, 1970, barely three months after hundreds of student radicals rioted in Chicago and a month and 10 days after the nation instituted the first draft lottery since World War II. While other shows—like 1969’s top-rated program, *Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In* —were pretending to be edgy while insisting that there was only one right side to history and that you better be on it unless you wanted to be called a square, “A Night of Fright Is No Delight” delivered something very close to that rarest of all qualities in American popular entertainment: moral complexity.

The gang sticks together as only high schoolers, unburdened by the yokes of adulthood, can, and in doing so they create the sort of small, self-sufficient, and resilient community that would’ve made Thomas Jefferson proud.

All of this, really, should come as no surprise to anyone who has paid even scant attention to the franchise. For one thing, while so much of American pop culture situates itself in the cities or the suburbs, the Mystery Inc. gang always travels to remote places way out in the wilderness—an abandoned home on the bayou, say, or an abandoned mining camp—because they realize that these places aren’t abandoned at all. They writhe on, haunted monuments to the sacrifices, many of them terrifying, it took to build this great nation, and a reminder that while we may be through with the past, the past is hardly through with us.

It’s the sort of disquieting metaphysical truth only an adolescent, not yet corrupted by stifling conventions and atmospheric anxieties, can truly understand, which, hallelujah, is another one of *Scooby-Doo* ’s great charms. Fred and Daphne and Velma and Shaggy, like America itself, are perpetual teenagers. They distrust authority, and for good reason: The grown-ups in charge are often dim-witted dolts more interested in power than in truth, beauty, and all that good stuff.

The gang sticks together as only high schoolers, unburdened by the yokes of adulthood, can, and in doing so they create the sort of small, self-sufficient, and resilient community that would’ve made Thomas Jefferson proud. The jock, the beauty queen, the nerd, the stoner, even their dog, all have a role to play and all fit in, judged by the content of their characters rather than the sheen of their charisma or the magnitude of their means.

These elected affinities, and they alone, allow the gang to succeed, again and again, in restoring the social order—a big theme for a show that debuted in 1969, when just about every American institution, from the family to the church to the nation itself, felt as if it was teetering on the brink of collapse.

And this, perhaps, is the most profound—and most profoundly overlooked—virtue of *Scooby-Doo*.

The show is often mocked for its rote endings, in which the gang captures the creature chasing it, pulls off its mask, and learns that what had appeared as a supernatural menace was truly just a lawyer trying to make a buck or a curator scheming to sell a bunch of forged paintings for profit.

Cynics may claim that these reveals make the show less scary—can’t they just give us a *real* zombie or mummy or ghost every once in a while? But we, watching it in 2025 in an America once again wrestling with institutional decay and political turmoil, know better. We realize that the villains being all too human makes them scarier. A couple of Phantom Shadows we can handle; a couple of lawyers readily willing to dispense with four children and their pet for a quick payout is much harder to take.

Which makes *Scooby-Doo* much more serious about the problem of evil than most other American pop culture creations. We tend to like our baddies unburdened by nuance: Like Darth Vader or Hannibal Lecter or the shark from *Jaws*, they are the ravenous id personified, emerging from the deep or the dark to devour us. That’s the sort of matinee malice we enjoy, because evil, in this account, doesn’t need to be explained or grappled with but simply blown away. *Scooby-Doo* offers a much more troubling—and darker—philosophical outlook, returning again and again to the idea that even the most upstanding among us might be tempted, should the payout suffice, to don some creepy rubber suit and contemplate terrible crimes.

Or stop them: In *Scooby-Doo* ’s Technicolor universe, the do-gooders are just as ordinary as the monsters. If the show teaches us anything, it’s that it is up to all of us to stand up to the power-hungry and corrupt, the cynical and the uncaring, the deceitful and the cruel, because in America we don’t let these sorts of things slide.

Much of our creative energy for the last 50 years has been spent trying to argue that underneath America’s wholesome facade lies a dark and troubled heart. *Scooby-Doo*, and pretty much it alone, travels in the opposite direction, insisting that even what’s rotten and vile can yet be saved by courage and camaraderie. That’s an upbeat vision of America we can use these days. Our self-appointed, self-hating intellectuals tried to convince us that we’re all just a bunch of callous sinners—and they would’ve gotten away with it, if it weren’t for those meddling kids and their dog.
