**THE BUZZ:** **CATCHIN’ BASS —** Los Angeles Mayor **Karen Bass** enjoyed a long, even luxurious honeymoon with the city since ascending to its top office in 2022, building coalitions and staking a reputation as an in-the-weeds manager focused on local issues like homelessness.

Then came the fires.

Four infernos that have killed at least as many people tore through Los Angeles and neighboring cities while Bass was on a regrettably-timed diplomatic trip nearly 7,500 miles away in Ghana.

While communities burned, thousands of residents evacuated and fire hydrants ran dry Tuesday, Bass was overseas. And on Wednesday, when everyone from President **Joe Biden** to Gov. **Gavin Newsom** and Sen. **Alex Padilla** made public appearances as the crisis escalated, Bass was still making her way home.

The mayor’s striking absence immediately became a target for political foes and even some exasperated supporters, frustrating Angelenos and tarnishing her long-cultivated image as an assiduous and detail-oriented executive.

“Is it as bad as **Ted Cruz** going to Cancun? No. But it could be an indelible dent in her image,” one veteran Democratic consultant in the city, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about the political dynamics, told our colleague **Melanie Mason**, [reporting from Los Angeles](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/08/wildfire-threatens-karen-bass-extended-honeymoon-00197228).

Bass’ political nemesis, billionaire shopping mall developer **Rick Caruso**, accused his 2022 rival of shirking her duties. “Of course you don’t go,” Caruso said of her overseas expedition in an interview with Playbook. “That's not leadership. That's abandoning your post.”

More criticism of Bass’ leadership came in from the owner of the Los Angeles Times and **Tommy Vietor**, the "Pod Save America" co-host and Obama White House alum.

“Inexplicable decision to not come back earlier,” Vietor wrote on X.

It wasn’t just her travel. Far-left (and conservative) activists online accused the mayor of cutting the fire department’s budget to pay for a costly new contract with the city’s police. **Patrick Soon-Shiong**, the aforementioned Los Angeles Times owner, echoed the attack, posting on X that “the Mayor cut LA Fire Department’s budget by $23M.”

That assertion is wrong. The city was in the process of negotiating a new contract with the fire department at the time the budget was being crafted, so additional funding for the department was set aside in a separate fund until that deal was finalized in November. In fact, the city’s fire budget increased more than $50 million year-over-year compared to the last budget cycle.

But the mayor’s team did not respond on the record to POLITICO inquiries about Soon-Shiong’s post, or address related falsehoods for many hours, allowing the incorrect information to circulate widely and take hold. Bass didn’t do herself any favors. She [did not respond](https://news.sky.com/video/la-mayor-asked-if-she-owes-citizens-apology-over-handling-of-wildfires-13285730) under nearly two minutes of tough questions from a reporter who cornered her, including one about the alleged budget cuts for fire.

“Have you absolutely nothing to say to the citizens today?” the reporter asked her.

“No apology for them?” he continued, as she looked on silently. “Do you think you should have been visiting Ghana while this was unfolding back home?”

Finally, on Wednesday evening, at her first news conference since returning from Africa, Bass tried to emphasize the extent of her involvement with fire response from afar. Bass said she was in “constant contact” with her commanders, as well as with local, state and federal officials. Her allies in the police union came to her defense and accused Caruso of [politicizing a crisis](https://x.com/LAPPL/status/1877164176193224863).

“I took the fastest route back, which included being on a military plane, which facilitated our communications,” Bass said. “I was able to be on the phone the entire time of the flight.”

**WHERE’S GAVIN?** In Los Angeles, working with local, state and federal fire officials responding to the Palisades fire.  

**LURIE’S NEW DAY —** **Daniel Lurie** was sworn in as San Francisco’s 46th mayor on Wednesday in a ceremony where he vowed to aggressively take on the fentanyl addiction and homelessness crises that have long eluded city leaders.

Highlights from his [inauguration speech](https://www.youtube.com/live/N5oV3jqRm40), which he delivered in front of a crowd of about 2,500 residents and dignitaries gathered in a plaza outside City Hall:

**On street conditions:** “San Francisco has long been known for its values of tolerance and inclusion, but nothing about those values instructs us to allow nearly 8,000 people to experience homelessness in our city. Widespread drug dealing, public drug use and constantly seeing people in crisis has robbed us of our sense of decency and security.”

**On the budget deficit:** “We can no longer hide from our fiscal reality. A problem of this magnitude requires us to make some painful decisions and rethink the way that we operate. We need to stop spending more than we can afford.”

**On downtown’s slow recovery:** “My job is not to demand that the private sector be back in the office every day. My job is to make you want to be downtown again for work, with your family, with your friends.”

**On Trump (though he didn’t mention the president-elect’s name):** “I know that many feel a great sense of fear and loss about the state of our country right now. I share those concerns. San Francisco has long been a historic beacon for human rights, and we cannot be complacent.”

**SPOTTED:** **IN THE CROWD —** Outgoing Mayor **London Breed** … former mayors **Willie Brown** and **Frank Jordan** … California first partner **Jennifer Siebel Newsom** … SF Giants CEO **Larry Baer** … state Senate President Pro Tem **Mike McGuire** … state Sen. **Scott Wiener** … Assemblymembers **Matt Haney** and **Catherine Stefani** … Golden State Warriors head coach **Steve Kerr** … City Attorney **David Chiu** … new Board of Supervisors President **Rafael Mandelman** … outgoing Supervisors **Dean Preston** and **Ahsha Safaí** … Supervisors **Danny Sauter**, **Stephen Sherrill**, **Connie Chan** and **Myrna Melgar**  

**FIRESTORM —** The deadly, wind-fueled conflagrations tearing through Los Angeles County since Tuesday night are adding fuel to the political fire — and California’s ongoing insurance crisis. Read about how LA's fires could push the state's teetering insurance market to the brink of collapse in last night's [California Climate](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-climate/2025/01/08/a-perfect-storm-00197226).  

**OAKLAND OFFICIAL —** After _many_ months of speculation, former Rep. **Barbara Lee** made her move on Wednesday: [she’s running for mayor of Oakland](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/08/barbara-lee-oakland-mayor-race-00197064), aiming to take control of the embattled city in an April 15 special election.

Lee, who represented Oakland in Congress for nearly three decades, announced her [decision in a video](https://x.com/BarbaraLee_CA/status/1877023784382734772) that prominently referenced her vote as the [lone member of Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/08/17/barbara-lee-afghanistan-vote/) to oppose the war in Afghanistan, calling her the one person who “spoke truth to power.”

In the video, Lee said she’s running for mayor because Oakland needs a candidate who can unify residents to tackle its budget crisis and address deep problems with crime and homelessness. “They’ve said we are a city divided,” Lee said. “But let’s show them that we are one Oakland.”

She enters a crowded field, with 15 other candidates running to replace [recalled former Mayor **Sheng Thao**](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/09/oakland-mayor-progressive-da-ousted-00187549). But Lee, a progressive icon with strong name recognition, is widely expected to clear the field on the left. Former City Councilmember **Loren Taylor**, a comparatively moderate Democrat who narrowly lost the race for mayor in 2022, is viewed as her most formidable opponent.

Rep. [**Lateefah Simon**](https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/f26c61bc-e7b7-40d3-bcce-22f97db9e4c0), who succeeded Lee in Congress, immediately endorsed her mentor’s campaign. In a [video](https://x.com/lateefahsimon/status/1877139185213256159) shared first with Playbook, Simon said “no one is as strong as Barbara Lee on the issues we care about.” Lee was also endorsed by former Gov. **Jerry Brown**, who was mayor of the East Bay city between his two stints as governor.  

**FIRST IN POLITICO:** **SEARCHING FOR FRIENDS —** Google is donating $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, our [colleague **Steven Overly** reports today](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/09/congress/google-donation-donald-trump-inauguration-00197233). The move matches contributions from Meta, Amazon, OpenAI CEO **Sam Altman** and Apple CEO **Tim Cook**. Tech companies have clamored to win Trump over in the months since his election, with Google’s CEO **Sundar Pichai** among a line of executives who have flocked to Mar-a-Lago for meetings with the incoming president.
