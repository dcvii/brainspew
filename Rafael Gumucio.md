Rafael Gumucio is a well-known Chilean writer and comedian.

\[Translated from Spanish by Grok.\]

q/Like many people, my heart is on the left. I have always voted for some variation of it. My way of understanding the world has deep roots both in Marxism and in its critiques from the same left, from Camus to Orwell. But I discover that what separates me from the official left—or at least from its Twitter version—is precisely the heart.

Because I am on the left, my first impulse upon Maduro's fall is a visceral joy. Not because of who provoked it—Trump awakens no sympathy in me—but for the millions of Venezuelans who have spent years fleeing a grotesque parody of socialism. For the mothers who haven't seen their children grow up. For the professionals driving Uber in Santiago. For those who died crossing the Darién.

The left I know on Twitter thinks the opposite: first anti-imperialism, then sovereignty, then non-intervention, and finally—if there's any space left—the Venezuelans. As if the principle of non-intervention weighed more than the bodies tortured in El Helicoide. As if the human rights of the tyrant mattered more than those of his victims.

This automatic reflex repeats itself in every crisis. In Cuba, the dynastic corruption of the Castros always weighs less than the embargo. When Iranian women remove their veils and confront the mullahs, the left first seeks to denounce the CIA. When the subway was burned in Santiago, one had to understand the rage before lamenting the cashier who couldn't get to work. It doesn't matter that the mullahs execute homosexuals, that the mujahideen stone women, that the Castros imprison poets: if they are against the United States, they deserve understanding.

I understand the reasoning. I know the history of interventions, coups d'état, the School of the Americas. I know that the United States gives nothing away and that Trump is a sinister figure. But what I cannot understand is the absence of basic human emotion. That doctrinal coldness that is not moved by videos of Venezuelans crying with joy in the streets of Caracas. That feels nothing for Iranian women cutting their hair in rebellion. That always has a "but" ready before a hug.

Of course, I would prefer that Venezuelans had overthrown their tyrant alone. But I know—because history teaches it—that few dictatorships fall without some form of international pressure. The Chilean one didn't. The Argentine one neither. The Spanish one even less. And of all the possible outcomes after the brutal fraud of July, this is one of the least bloody.

Today Venezuelans are celebrating. The streets of Caracas are filling with a hope we thought was dead. And I, who remain on the left precisely because I believe in human dignity before geopolitical abstractions, celebrate with them.

Tomorrow there will be time to analyze, criticize, contextualize. Today, just today, let me feel this joy without asking permission from the good anti-imperialist's handbook. Let me put the heart where the left always should have had it: on the side of the people, not of the maps./q
