### DEI finds new footholds; A visit from Charlie Kirk revives enthusiasm for censorship; USC's Alzheimer's research scrutinized, and more.

*News is moving even faster with the Trump administration in charge. We’re attempting to cover everything we can, but if we’ve missed something please reach out at heterodoxatusc@substack.com.*

#### DEI: Durable, Everywhere, Intractable

**[Reporting would make many assume](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-28/usc-scrubs-dei-websites-trump-campus-diversity-programs)** that USC is backing away from DEI ideology. That doesn’t actually seem to be the case.

As we discussed last week, **[DEI has found a comfortable new home](https://heterodoxatusc.substack.com/p/uscs-federal-funding-gets-scrutinized)** over in the Culture Team/Commission (whatever) and its “Unifying Values,” which lists “DEI” as one “our” values. Even though, again, ***[no one actually voted for it](https://heterodoxatusc.substack.com/p/heterodox-at-usc-newsletter-11)******[as a unifying value](https://heterodoxatusc.substack.com/p/heterodox-at-usc-newsletter-11)*****[.](https://heterodoxatusc.substack.com/p/heterodox-at-usc-newsletter-11)**

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc109e773-c988-4200-8876-d633e1500968_865x865.webp)

In a recent **[interview with USC Annenberg and the Daily Trojan, President Folt](https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2025/03/04/a-sit-down-with-president-carol-folt/)** basically confirmed as much:

> When \[former chief diversity and inclusion officer Christopher Manning\] stepped down more than a year ago, he actually said we need to rethink the whole thing. So this has been a process of where we’re thinking we can be best at supporting everyone’s needs, their belonging, their culture, but even beyond that, and going into the professional offices **where the art allows it to be at the heart of the Culture Commission. So this isn’t a new thing. This is a progression.**

When asked about the DEI staff that were moved out of roles and into the Culture Office:

> So I think we’re doing it exactly as we have been and should do. So where we’re seeing the three people that moved, **it’s really because we’re trying to get them in a much better place.** It’s something that’s been under works for a long time.

DEI is continuing to influence all sorts of elements of the university, such as our **[Student Recognition Awards](https://studentrecognition.usc.edu/).** The award required nominators to select two “unifying values” which their nominee exemplifies, one of which could be DEI.

**As a side note:** we appreciate President Folt and the USC student journalists for putting together this candid interview.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd57aec5d-dbce-4403-a212-9037d58e1edc_1080x1080.jpeg)

Press X to doubt.

#### Pay-rolled Radicals

We also continue to have DEI activists on pay-roll. One recently sent around a mass (unsolicited) email to numerous USC faculty, alerting them to the **[National DEI Defense Coalition](https://race.usc.edu/coalition/)** hosted on a USC website. This comes with a 65-page report on why DEI is good, actually.

This is one of the many problems with hiring activist faculty. They spend their workweek advancing an ideological cause, subsidized by the university. Anyone in opposition to the cause is on an immediate back foot, required to combat politicization in their spare time and without the university’s tacit approval.

#### Shell games continue

And,**[as we reported recently](https://heterodoxatusc.substack.com/p/presidential-search-committee-and),** the USC Dornsife Diversity Equity Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) Office, suddenly became the “Office of Equity and Engagement” starting in the 2024-2025 academic year. Within the last few weeks, a total website rewrite has now magically turned it into the “USC Dornsife Office of Community and Engagement” — with the exact same staff (all originally hired to advance DEI ideology) in place.

#### Censorship for our own good

Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk **[recently paid a visit to the USC campus](https://dailytrojan.com/2025/03/04/charlie-kirk-debate-draws-hundreds-to-hahn-plaza/)**, hosted by **[USC’s Turning Point USA chapter.](https://engage.usc.edu/turningpointusaatusc/home/)** Kirk stationed himself near Tommy Trojan where students could engage in open debate style discussions.

Things seemed to go off without major incident, aside from one student spitting at a Kirk employee (who chose not to press charges) and another who assaulted a DPS officer when they preventing her from playing music over Kirk’s conversations. (A common protest strategy now is to play copy-righted music during events to try and prevent videos from getting shared online since they’d get flagged for copy-right violations.)

Many students seemed to have a curious, tolerant attitude:

> Channin Zhao, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, said beside that interaction, he thought the event sparked some peaceful discussion between people in the crowd.
> 
> “We disagreed, but we had a very peaceful discussion,” Zhao said. “These things happen. We bring an opposite voice on campus.”

Others, however, had incredibly **[alarming attitudes](https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2025/03/03/charlie-kirk-comes-to-campus/),** advocating for outright censorship:

> “I think it’s important to have open political dialog. I also think it’s important to recognize that there are certain things that shouldn’t be debated. We shouldn’t be debating personhood, we shouldn’t be debating natural rights, we shouldn’t be debating human rights. Those are inherent, those are givens,” said Troutt. “And if someone has come out against the promotion of natural and human rights, they don’t really have a place on a college campus, or really anywhere.”

Using moral certainty to silence debate and discussion is a popular tactic of authoritarian regimes. The Soviet Union suppressed the science of Mendelian genetics because they believed it violated obvious moral truths. At a meeting of the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1948, Soviet scientist Isaak Prezent shut down debate around genetics in an remarkably similar way:

> We are encouraged to debate here. We will not discuss with the Morganists \[advocates of Mendelian genetics\], we will continue to expose them as representatives of a harmful and ideologically alien movement, brought to us from foreign countries, pseudoscientific in its essence.

Soviets instead advanced pseudoscientific **[Lysenkoism](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6499510/)**, which conveniently fit communist ideals of cooperation rather then competition. This **[led to mass starvation.](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/12/trofim-lysenko-soviet-union-russia/548786/)**

#### Doctored Research

![brown brain decor in selective-focus photography](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559757148-5c350d0d3c56?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxMXx8YnJhaW4lMjBwdXp6bGV8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzQxNTQ2NTczfDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

**[In previous newsletters](https://heterodoxatusc.substack.com/p/heterodox-at-usc-newsletter-11)**we’ve mentioned the drastic dip in trust of academia and scientists. Some of this is likely connected to the hyper-politicization of the academy. The problem of misleading and fraudulent research, and the failure of institutions to properly investigate this, may also play a role.

A new book by science journalist Charles Piller, ***[Doctored: Fraud, Arrogance, and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer’s](https://bookshop.org/p/books/doctored-fraud-arrogance-and-tragedy-in-the-quest-to-cure-alzheimer-s-charles-piller/21534137?ean=9781668031247&next=t&next=t)***, covers the extensive issues plaguing the field of Alzheimer’s research, a web of greed and hubris which may have stymied progress on finding treatments for this disease.

One chapter of Piller’s book is devoted to the research of **[Berislav Zlokovic](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/berislav-v-zlokovic/)**, University Professor, Mary Hayley and Selim K. Zilkha Chair in Alzheimer’s Disease Research at the USC Keck School of Medicine (now on leave), whose highly regarded research has been called into question. From **[a 2024](https://www.science.org/content/article/top-alzheimer-s-researcher-goes-leave-amid-misconduct-concerns)** ***[Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/top-alzheimer-s-researcher-goes-leave-amid-misconduct-concerns)*** **[article](https://www.science.org/content/article/top-alzheimer-s-researcher-goes-leave-amid-misconduct-concerns):**

> The *Science* investigation cited a 113-page dossier prepared by forensic image analysts, including scientists, showing apparent image doctoring in dozens of journal articles co-authored by Zlokovic. One of the most influential researchers on the role of the blood-brain barrier in stroke and Alzheimer’s, Zlokovic was the only common author across the 37 papers, and the senior author on 29. Most of these findings were later posted to [PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/search?q=berislav+zlokovic).
> 
> Several of the studies questioned in the dossier involved the experimental drug 3K3A-APC. Zlokovic and others postulated that it would reduce brain damage in people who suffered ischemic strokes, caused by blood clots. But the dossier described signs that 3K3A-APC might have increased the risk of death among participants in a clinical trial.

When this sort of malfeasance occurs, it is not just the individual scientist whose reputation suffers but the institution who hosts them. Eager to attract financial funding and fame, institutions often silence, ignore, punish or side-line whistle blowers when they question star researchers (until outside investigations force their hand.)

To improve the veracity of our research, and boost the public’s perception of science, USC should form a committee to investigate the oversight processes for research. They should also put robust policies in place to protect whistle-blowers.

#### Antiscientific Vandalism

**[Evan Morris](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/evan-morris/)**, professor of radiology, biomedical imaging and biomedical engineering at Yale issued a strong warning about the recent, sweeping cuts to the National Institute of Health by the Trump administration:

> To understand how biomedical scientists feel as they watch Donald Trump and Elon Musk aim their bazookas at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recall how you felt when the Taliban aimed their bazookas at the 1,500-year-old [Bamiyan Buddhas of Afghanistan](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/rebuild-bamiyan-buddhas-taliban-afghanistan?ref=quillette.com__;!!LIr3w8kk_Xxm!oWRWN7wCjqQbodDZN1CvTk7MWw9uDsxaq3b2P5tL_jCYKNo1wXntTAxhDX3f_f2DiO2LLVgiGgePP4NEcRAE4A$). “Senseless” may be one word that springs to mind. “Permanent” might be another.
> 
> But the destruction of NIH is in many ways worse than the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas. The Buddhas were an astounding feat of architecture and sculpture and devotion. But there were just two of them. NIH contains 27 institutes and centres, each of which specialises in the research and cure of a whole class of diseases. The work of these institutes occurs, in part, at NIH proper, but the bulk of the work occurs at universities (the so-called “extramural” program) funded through grants.

**Wednesday, 12 at 12pm: [Are Cable News and Legacy Media All But Dead?](https://calendar.usc.edu/event/are-cable-news-and-legacy-media-all-but-dead)**

##### **USC University Club at Kings Stoop Hall**

In the words of economist and scholar Arnold Kling, Martin Gurri saw it coming.

Technology has categorically reversed the information balance of power between the public and the elites who manage the great hierarchical institutions of the industrial age: government, political parties, the media. Gurri's book, ***[The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium](https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143)***, tells the story of how insurgencies, enabled by digital devices and a vast information sphere, have mobilized millions of ordinary people around the world.

Join the **[USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future](https://dornsife.usc.edu/center-for-political-future/)** for a discussion of how the changing media landscape has contributed to global populist trends. Gurri, a former CIA analyst and an expert on the relationship between politics and media, is joined by CPF Director Bob Shrum, journalist and author Adam Nagourney, and Annenberg School of Journalism Director Gordon Stables.
