Some big news today on the political antitrust front. The most consequential antitrust power struggle you’ve never heard of has been won… by the good guys. The short story is the Trump administration just said they will enforce antitrust law to stop harmful mergers using the guidelines that Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter helped create in 2023.

Here’s the longer version. For years, BIG has been writing about the problems with corporate consolidation, a phenomenon which raises prices, lowers quality, harms wages, and fosters shortages. And consolidation is a result of too many big corporate combinations, when two companies combine into one so they can reduce competition in a market. Corporate mergers, I’ve noted over and over, [ruin everything](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/mergers-ruin-everything). But mergers weren’t [always common](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/mergers-didnt-really-used-to-be-a) in America. So where did this consolidation craze come from? And how can it be stopped?

In a piece I published a few years ago - [The Secret Plot to Unleash Corporate Power](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-secret-plot-to-unleash-corporate) - I explained the origin of today’s monopoly crisis. In 1982, Ronald Reagan’s antitrust chief, Bill Baxter, wanted to relax antitrust law. The goal was to foster a merger wave, since he thought that bigness, financed by a less regulated Wall Street apparatus, meant companies were becoming more efficient. Baxter believed that any inefficient monopolist with excess profit would face market discipline, as bankers would simply finance a new entrant into the market to bring down margins. As Alan Greenspan put it, “the ultimate regulator of competition in a free economy is the capital market.”

But Baxter had a problem with his goal of ending most merger enforcement; the Clayton Act was law, and Congress didn’t want to change it. So instead, at the behest of Chicago Schoolers George Stigler and Richard Posner, Baxter changed *the guidelines* that agencies use to oversee mergers. It was an administrative shift in the law, a way around Congress. And it worked. For forty years, merger law was stuck in a ditch, often through non-enforcement, as wave after wave of consolidation tore through most industries in America. The fall of antitrust was part of a set of shifts in which political and economic power in the economy moved from builders, engineers, and business people, to financiers.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2a13d11-430b-468e-a89f-17f5de06245f_978x522.png)

But then, in 2008, a financial crisis fostered by Too Big to Fail banks shocked our political order, generating a skepticism towards size among a new generation of policymakers. Lina Khan, for instance, graduated from college and went into journalism right after that crisis, writing about monopolies in everything from candy to airlines. In 2015, this skepticism started to enter the policy realm, with then-Antitrust chief Bill Baer ginning up some challenges to big health insurance mergers. It continued through the Trump administration’s complaint against AT&T-Time Warner, as enforcers began rediscovering the purpose behind the antitrust laws.

One of the policy goals of Biden antitrust enforcers Jonathan Kanter and Lina Khan was to fully reverse the shift that Baxter oversaw. They started immediately upon being confirmed to their positions, putting out proposals on merger guidelines, doing a public comment process, and hosting public hearings. BIG readers took part in this process; thousands of you wrote in to the agencies with your stories and thoughts about mergers. The result of all of this effort was a new set of guidelines that conform to the laws that Congress actually wrote and that courts have interpreted, rather than the imaginations of speculation prone economists.

The publication of the new guidelines was a moment where the old [corrupt priesthood](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/antitrust-guidelines-and-overthrowing) of antitrust attorneys lost. But there were a couple of questions. Would courts find the new guidelines persuasive? Skeptics said that judges would see this change as radical, and revert back to the economics-friendly merger guidelines of 2010. But that didn’t happen.

So far, in cases such as Kroger-Albertsons and Tapestry-Capri, ten courts have found the guidelines persuasive. Beyond that many conservatives came to accept the arguments about market power; influential right-wing scholar Todd J. Zywicki [called](https://fedsoc.org/events/national-press-club-event) the new guidelines ‘moderate’ and ‘reasonable’ at a Federalist Society event. Today, Steve Bannon calls himself a “neo-Brandeisian” who thinks Lina Khan should have had a lot more power.

Still, there was another open question about whether the second Trump administration, having taken over from an administration they disdain, would seek to roll back this achievement, or would have continuity with what Trump did in his first term. Wall Street, and the old guard scholars like Herb Hovenkamp, thought they would go back to a neoliberal and merger friendly set of guidelines.

But they didn’t.

Today, the Trump Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division both affirmed their commitment to what the Biden enforcers built, to the ten plus years of anti-monopoly arguments. Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson sent out [a memo](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/ferguson-memo-re-merger-guidelines.pdf) to his staff instructing them to evaluate mergers using the 2023 guidelines. And Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division Omeed Assefi [did](https://www.justice.gov/atr/media/1389861/dl?inline) as well.

And that’s more than just talk. A few weeks ago, the Trump Antitrust Division [challenged](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/trump-antitrust-division-challenges) a significant $14 billion tech merger, Hewlett Packard - Juniper Networks, which shocked and frustrated Wall Street. Mergers are [down](https://www.ft.com/content/a7c9376b-4cb2-4cf2-a665-66f75b72f4c2) 30% in January compared to last year, which, while mostly due to financing costs and tariff uncertainties, isn’t unrelated to concerns over antitrust.

The reaction has been what you’d expect, with anti-monopolists supportive and libertarians, well, not so much. Wall Street merger arbs, the people who speculate on consolidation, are [unhappy](https://x.com/JulianKlymochko/status/1891973302060507578). So are [big](https://x.com/ATabarrok/status/1891927541323055165) [tech lobbyists](https://x.com/JosephVConiglio/status/1891970397995741300?t=K56_EPPs0fw9qqiaQKLGow&s=09), big tech friendly [Silicon Valley venture capitalists](https://x.com/twistartups/status/1892035209391964671?t=n_ThlzIQwe6gIpScr5TBcg&s=09), and [big law defense lawyers](https://x.com/MacLeodBill/status/1891939074212077848) on [both](https://x.com/JDGrossman/status/1892002525777109411?t=jEhSmA1alafXiyXLl-XfsA&s=09) [sides](https://x.com/BrianCAlbrecht/status/1891961537775964439) of the aisle. Here’s Geoffrey Manne, whose father Henry Manne helped build the law and economics movement, expressed sadness and disapproval:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1aae9b8b-00dd-4e8c-ad1f-817c03dd7d91_479x347.png)

This embrace of the Khan/Kanter merger guidelines comes as part of a broader rethink of Trump’s relationship with the antitrust establishment. Four days ago, Ferguson [sought](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/02/ftc-chairman-ferguson-announces-new-policy-regarding-american-bar-association) to cut the FTC’s ties with the American Bar Association Antitrust Section over its “far left” leanings and affiliations with big tech. While I find the accusation of left-wing bias unpersuasive, it is true the ABA Antitrust Section has for years been a bedrock of lawlessness and big law corruption. In 2016, the ABA Antitrust Section lawyers did a [report](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-rage-of-the-corporate-lawyer) on whether criticism of antitrust by both political parties was valid. Here’s what they wrote:

> Antitrust figured prominently in the 2016 Election: for the first time in recent memory, both major parties prominently featured their respective viewpoints on competition and consumer protection policy. Campaign commentary included sharp criticism of an alleged absence of vigor and overall ineffectiveness in current patterns of antitrust enforcement, with comments calling for sharp, even radical reorientation of enforcement policy, especially in the review of proposed mergers and treatment of large industrial firms. As will be seen in this Report, the Section does not share these views about the current state of antitrust enforcement policy.

To the big law experts, the public was just wrong. Everything in America has been going great. The ABA Antitrust Section is undergoing reform, and Ferguson’s move to cut off ties will spur more of it. But beyond the institutional spat, the acceptance of the new merger guidelines by both sides of the aisle means that the intellectual and political argument is over. There’s no going back.

Now, let’s not overstate the reality of enforcement going forward. There are reasons that the Trump administration sees value in antitrust, there are also reasons for skepticism, most notably that a hollowed out government will find it difficult to litigate cases. And these enforcers do not have the same priorities or instincts as Kanter and Khan did. That said, these announcements on the merger guidelines are a big deal. Anti-monopolists are now the bipartisan center. And ever so slightly, this policy victory brings us closer to being a country that makes stuff again.

Or to put it in a way that conservatives would appreciate, the Trump administration just declared there will be no more DEI for the merger and finance expert class who have used consolidation to hollow out American communities.
