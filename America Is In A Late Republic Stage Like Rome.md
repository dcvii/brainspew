### History suggests republics don’t last more than 250 years. An interview with Nathan Gardels, recorded on February 10.

Niall Ferguson is the celebrated historian, commentator and biographer whose many books include “The Ascent of Money,” “Kissinger: The Idealist,” “Civilization: The West and the Rest” and “The Square and the Tower.” A senior fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University and at the Belfer Center at Harvard University, Ferguson recently sat down with Noema Editor-in-Chief Nathan Gardels to discuss the Trump agenda, the conflict with China, polarization in America and his own conversion to Christianity. This interview is excerpted from a forthcoming Berggruen Institute podcast.

Nathan Gardels: Under the Trump administration’s radical sovereigntism, which summarily defects from the rules-based liberal world order founded by the U.S. after World War II, it appears America is joining the other axes of upheaval, China and Russia. All these major powers now seek to build their own spheres of influence that challenge such an order.

How do you see this unfolding?

Niall Ferguson: Well, I don’t agree that the United States is somehow aligning itself in any way with the axis of whatever you want to call it, authoritarians, upheaval or ill will.

What’s odd about the last four years before Trump is that the Biden-Harris administration came in and was welcomed by liberals around the world. “The adults were back in the room.” American foreign policy was going to respect alliances again, and it all went disastrously wrong. The allies have been sorely disappointed. The net result of the Biden administration’s foreign policy was that an axis formed that didn’t exist in 2020, an axis that brought together Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. And unlike the axis of evil of 2002 around the Iraq war, it actually exists. It’s not just an idea for a speech. These powers cooperate together, economically and militarily.

What went wrong? The answer is a disastrous failure of deterrence that really began in Afghanistan in 2021, got a lot worse in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine, and got even worse in 2023 when Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad attacked Israel. So, I think one has to understand the re-election of Donald Trump as partly a public reaction against a very unsuccessful Democratic administration, a little bit like what happened in 1980 when Americans voted for Ronald Reagan and repudiated Jimmy Carter during the Iran hostage crisis.

When one asks, what the result of re-electing Donald Trump is, I don’t think that it’s a big win for China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Quite the opposite. I think it’s bad news for them.

Let’s just break it down briefly. Many people wrongly thought that it would be beneficial to Vladimir Putin if Donald Trump were re-elected. I don’t think this war is going to be ended on Putin’s terms, if it’s going to be ended. Secondly, maximum pressure is now back on Iran. That’s important. Thirdly, tariffs have been increased on China, so the pressure is on China. Little Rocket Man in North Korea is still waiting to get whatever is coming to him, but I don’t think it’s going to be a love letter from the Trump administration.

In short, for the axis of ill will, it’s bad news that Trump is back.
