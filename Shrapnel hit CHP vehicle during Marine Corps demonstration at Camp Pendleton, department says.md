CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (KABC) -- Metal shrapnel from an explosive ordinance fired during the U.S. Marine Corps' 250th anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton on Saturday hit a California Highway Patrol vehicle, the agency published in an internal report.

The celebration, which included a military exercise using live artillery fire, shut down a 17-mile stretch of the 5 Freeway in both directions off and on for about four hours, [stranding drivers for hours.](https://abc7.com/post/5-freeway-shut-down-due-marines-anniversary-event-camp-pendleton-chp-says/18032168/)

A 17-mile stretch of the 5 Freeway was shut down Saturday because of a military event involving live ammunition at Camp Pendleton.

CHP says around 1:46 p.m., an explosive ordnance that was fired over the freeway prematurely detonated overhead from White's Beach, about three-quarters of a mile south of Las Pulgas Road, striking and damaging a CHP patrol vehicle as officers were supporting the traffic closure. The shrapnel also reportedly hit a CHP motorcycle, but it was not damaged.

"This was an unusual and concerning situation," said CHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado. "It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway. As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them."

CHP said no injuries were reported, and officers immediately notified the Marine Corps, who then canceled firing additional ordnance over the freeway.

"The CHP has filed an internal report on the incident, with a recommendation to conduct an additional after-action review into the planning, communication and coordination between federal, state, and local government around the event on Saturday, October 18, to strengthen protocols for future demonstrations and training events near public roadways," a CHP statement read.

In a [post on X](https://x.com/CAgovernor/status/1980033401282535827), Gov. Gavin Newsom said, "We love our Marines and owe a debt of gratitude to Camp Pendleton, but next time, the Vice President and the White House shouldn't be so reckless with people's lives for their vanity projects."

This comes after a back-and-forth disagreement between Newsom and the Marines via X on whether or not to shut down the 5 Freeway for the celebration.

The state was asked on Friday to put signage along the freeway that read "Overhead fire in progress," according to a statement from Newsom's office. Early Saturday morning, the federal government informed the state that the live fire activities were scheduled for Saturday afternoon.

While the [Marines stated they would not need to shut down the freeway](https://abc7.com/post/marines-say-live-ammunition-demonstration-will-not-close-5-freeway-camp-pendleton-250th-anniversary-event/18022086/) during live firing from Navy ships onto land, CHP elected to stop traffic out of caution that someone could get hurt or drivers could be distracted.

A spokesperson for Vice President JD Vance -- who was in attendance at Camp Pendleton -- declined to comment and deferred to the First Marine Expeditionary Force, which said they are committed to determining the incident's root cause and applying findings to future missions.
