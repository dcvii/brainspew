The animating spirit of America in the 1910s and 1920s was marked by a profound cultural and social transformation following the upheaval of World War I. The post-war era fostered a "cynical post-war mindset" characterized by a desire to live intensely in the present, encapsulated by the phrase "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you may die". This spirit was defined by unprecedented prosperity, technological advancement, and a surge in leisure activities, leading to a vibrant cultural explosion often referred to as the " " or the "Jazz Age". This period saw the rise of modernity, with innovations like automobiles, moving pictures, and radio bringing new forms of entertainment and communication to the masses. The era was also defined by a break with tradition, a redefinition of gender roles through the flapper phenomenon, and a flourishing of art, music, and literature, particularly during the Harlem Renaissance. However, this exuberance coexisted with deep social contradictions, including the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, nativism, and religious fundamentalism, highlighting the era's complex and often conflicting nature.

The fever for Prohibition arrived in the 1910s, culminating in the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 and its enforcement through the Volstead Act in 1920. This movement was driven by decades of pressure from temperance organizations like the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the Anti-Saloon League, who framed alcohol as a moral and social scourge. The prohibition of alcohol was intended to promote health, morality, and family stability, but it led to widespread unintended consequences, including the proliferation of illegal speakeasies, the rise of organized crime, and a black market for bootlegged liquor. The enforcement of Prohibition became increasingly untenable, and its failure was exacerbated by the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. The economic crisis created a dire need for government revenue and highlighted the social costs of Prohibition, including gang violence and the erosion of public respect for the law. As a result, public support for Prohibition collapsed, leading to its repeal by the Twenty-first Amendment in December 1933. The Great Migration, the movement of millions of African Americans from the rural South to urban centers in the North, was a major social trend of the 1910s and 1920s that contributed to the cultural dynamism of the era, particularly in the rise of jazz and the Harlem Renaissance. While Prohibition's rise and fall were directly tied to the economic and social upheavals of the 1920s and 1930s, the Great Migration was a longer-term demographic shift that profoundly influenced the cultural landscape during the same period.
