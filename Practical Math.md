I’m 54, a physicist, have spent decades using mathematics to study the universe, solve problems, and build things.  
  
If your work touches numbers, now or in the future, and you want to learn math properly, this thread shows a from-the-ground-up math you’ll actually need:

The roadmap has two parts.  
  
The first 25 threads follow this diagram:  
  
Algebra → Geometry → Trigonometry → Precalculus → Calculus → Linear Algebra & Multivariable Calculus  
  
After that, we map this math to real careers. Make sure to bookmark, you’ll need it later.

1\. Start with algebra. Learn to manipulate symbols cleanly. If you struggle here, everything later becomes noise.  
  
2\. Algebra is about rules and structure, not calculation speed. Slow down until each step feels obvious.

3\. Learn equations as cause–effect relations. Don’t solve, understand what changes what.  
  
4\. Geometry comes next. Learn how shapes, distances, and angles behave. This trains intuition that formulas alone won’t give.

5\. Treat geometry visually and algebraically at the same time. Translate pictures into equations and back.  
  
6\. Introduce vectors early. They unify algebra and geometry. Don’t delay this step.

7\. Trigonometry is about angles and rotation, not triangles. Focus on sine and cosine as functions.  
  
8\. Learn trig through the unit circle, not identities. If you can draw it, you understand it.

9\. Precalculus connects functions, trig, and algebra. Its job is to make calculus predictable.  
  
10\. If precalc feels unclear, stop and fix it. Calculus punishes weak foundations.

11\. Calculus starts with derivatives as rates of change. Forget formulas until the idea is clear.  
  
12\. A derivative answers: “What happens if I change this slightly”? Practice asking that question constantly.

13\. Use calculus to model behavior, not to compute expressions. Most real problems stop at setup.  
  
14\. Integration is accumulation. Area is just one example. Always ask: “What is being added up?”

15\. Calculus II is hard because it’s technical. Don’t memorize tricks, learn when each tool applies.  
  
16\. Learn limits conceptually, not mechanically. They explain why calculus works at all.

17\. Study logic and basic proofs next. This sharpens reasoning and prevents hidden assumptions.  
  
18\. Proofs train discipline, not elegance. Follow arguments line by line until nothing feels magical.

19\. Linear algebra should come early, not late. It explains structure in many-variable systems.  
  
20\. Think of matrices as transformations, not tables. This mental shift matters.

21\. Eigenvalues describe stability and long-term behavior. They’re ideas, not calculations.  
  
22\. Multivariable calculus reflects reality. Most systems depend on more than one input.v

23\. Partial derivatives isolate influence. Gradients show direction, not answers.  
  
24\. Learn constrained problems explicitly. Unconstrained math is rarely real.  
  
25\. Only after this, study probability and statistics. Uncertainty makes sense once change and structure do.

Foundation done. Applications start here:  
  
26\. Engineering  
Calculus + linear algebra + constraints.  
Used for modeling, optimization, and stability.  
  
27\. Machine Learning  
Linear algebra + probability + optimization.  
Everything else is implementation detail.

28\. Data Science  
Statistics + linear algebra + basic calculus.  
Focus on assumptions, not tools.  
  
29\. Finance  
Calculus + probability + linear systems.  
Rates of change and risk dominate.

30\. Physics  
Calculus, linear algebra, differential equations.  
Geometry and symmetry matter more than formulas.  
  
31\. Economics  
Multivariable calculus + optimization.  
Models live or die by assumptions.

32\. Computer Graphics  
Linear algebra + geometry + trig.  
Everything is transformations.  
  
33\. Control Systems  
Linear algebra + eigenvalues + calculus.  
Stability is the core question.

34\. Research  
Proofs + modeling + abstraction.  
Knowing why matters more than results.  
  
35\. Industry reality  
You don’t use all math daily.  
But weak foundations show up immediately.

If this sparked your interest, follow me for more practical math, physics and cosmic insights, plus the occasional dad joke.  
  
Repost to share with anyone learning science the hard way.

## More from @Kekius\_Sage

I’m Kekius Maximus, CEO of several companies.  
  
I’m going to share a few everyday physics facts that will change how you see the world forever, so if you’re curious, read this:

1) You don’t actually “touch” anything.  
→ What you feel as touch is electromagnetic repulsion between electrons, plus the Pauli exclusion principle preventing them from overlapping. It’s pushback, not atoms pressing together.  
  
2) Solid objects are mostly empty space.  
→ Atoms are like tiny solar systems: a minuscule nucleus with electrons around it. “Hardness” comes from forces and structure, not from being packed solid.

3) GPS only works because we correct for relativity.  
→ Satellites move fast and sit higher in Earth’s gravity, so their clocks tick differently than clocks on the ground. Without corrections, the error grows quickly.  
  
4) Your phone camera is basically counting photons.  
→ The sensor turns incoming photons into electrons, an electrical signal. The image is a measurement of light, not a picture that already exists.

I’m a 54-year-old low-tech dinosaur. I can barely find the settings menu.  
Still made $3,000 on X last month by posting about physics, cosmos stuff.  
  
If you’re still young and want to build a side hustle on X, read this:

1\. Start with the basics (eligibility) for at least 6 months.  
2\. Pick one lane first for at least 6 months. Ads rev share, subs, affiliates, sponsors. Choose one to learn before stacking the rest.

3\. Post daily (or almost daily) for at least 6 months. Consistency beats “random genius once a week.”  
4\. Chase attention, but keep trust for at least 6 months. Viral gets views. Trust gets income.

I’m 54, a physicist who’s spent decades unraveling the universe’s secrets—from quantum quirks to cosmic scales.  
  
If you’re in your 20s and passionate about physics or science, please read this:

1\. Build your mathematical foundation early. Calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations are your tools—master them like a craftsman.  
2\. Experiment relentlessly. Theory is great, but hands-on labs teach you the chaos of real data. Start with simple setups at home.

3\. Read classics first. Dive into Feynman, Einstein, or Newton’s originals before modern texts—they spark intuition.  
4\. Question everything. Science thrives on doubt; don’t accept “facts” without probing why.
