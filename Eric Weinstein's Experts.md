For whatever reason the campaign doesn’t reach out much. I don’t know why. But that is an observation so I don’t want to take crap for observing it. 

There are many dissident experts out here. Their phones are not ringing, and when you point this out it is treated the wrong way. “Boo hoo, everyone has a hand out.” It’s so dumb it’s funny, because these are exactly the people who have stood up for free for 30+ years. Just effing call them. They precede MAGA. 

Bottom line: there aren’t enough hardcore MAGA among the experts who know where the bodies are buried to run and fix the government. But there are dissident experts everywhere who will work even better in these positions. People who are aligned with the idea of clearing out the rot and who aren’t famously aligned with ideology. Patriots if you will.

Let me give an example. If you wanted to tackle immigration you would hear lots of talk about George Borjas. And Norm[@matloff](https://x.com/matloff)
. And Michael S Teitelbaum. And Edith Holleman. I’m not hearing any. 

If you wanted to solve the problem of the CPI undercounting inflation you would be discussing the failure of Superlative Index Numbers, the Boskin treachery and work of Bert Balk, Erwin Diewert, F. Fisher and Shell, Amartya Sen, Herb Gintis, P Malaney & me, Subramaniam Swamy,

If you were focused on the workforce for STEM you would reach out to all the critics who have been dying to fix or even discuss these problems. Richard Freeman, Ralph Gomory etc are old. But you would hear about them. I don’t . 

Look. Bottom line: MAGA doesn’t understand how administration Jobs work. If dissident experts were so hungry for jobs for personal gain they wouldn’t have been living on scraps and berries fighting this war against Washington before Trump ever came on the scene. They sacrificed their comfort for the country often scraping by. That is not the class of people asking to be made Treasury secretary on Twitter. 

The MAGA picture of expertise is wrong. Expertise didn’t fail. What failed is which experts we went with for 32 years. We just have the wrong experts everywhere. Don’t be afraid of non MAGA dissident experts. But they aren’t going to fall over themselves to beg for a position. 

The interpretation of MAGA and the campaign not reaching out is this: The transition team doesn’t understand the dissident expert landscape and doesn’t seem to care to either. It’s about loyalty. 

I don’t know if that is true because I have never spoken to anyone in the campaign. If it is wrong, then just place some calls out here. But I am not hearing from anyone I know among the heterodox experts “Hey I just got a call from the incoming administration.” I hear those calls coming to other people. But not the quiet folk. 

Start here: Call Borjas on immigration if you haven’t already. Call Norm Matloff. Call Harald Uhlig in general. I could go on. Everybody more or less knows everybody. They will help staff. And you will get great people who just aren’t very well known. One man’s opinion.
