The **Arab Spring** ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): الربيع العربي, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"): *ar-rabīʻ al-ʻarabī*) was a series of pro-democracy [anti-government protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance "Nonviolent resistance"), [uprisings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion "Rebellion"), and [armed rebellions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency "Insurgency") that spread across much of the [Arab world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world") in the early 2010s. It began [in Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_revolution "Tunisian revolution") in response to corruption and [economic stagnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_stagnation "Economic stagnation").[^3] [^4] [^5] From Tunisia, the protests initially spread to five other countries: [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya"), [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"), [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen"), [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria") and [Bahrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain "Bahrain"). Rulers were deposed ([Zine El Abidine Ben Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali "Zine El Abidine Ben Ali") of Tunisia, [Muammar Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi "Muammar Gaddafi") of Libya, and [Hosni Mubarak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak "Hosni Mubarak") of Egypt all in 2011, and [Ali Abdullah Saleh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh "Ali Abdullah Saleh") of Yemen in 2012) and major uprisings and social violence occurred, including riots, civil wars, or insurgencies. Sustained street demonstrations took place in [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco "Morocco"), [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq"), [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria"), [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon"), [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan"), [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait "Kuwait"), [Oman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman "Oman") and [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan "Sudan"). Minor protests took place in [Djibouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djibouti "Djibouti"), [Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania "Mauritania"), [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine "Palestine"), [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia") and the [Western Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara "Western Sahara").[^6] A major slogan of the demonstrators in the Arab world is *[ash-shaʻb yurīd isqāṭ an-niẓām!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash-shab_yurid_isqat_an-nizam "Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam")* ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'the people want to bring down the regime').[^7]

The wave of initial revolutions and protests faded by mid to late 2012, as many Arab Spring demonstrations were met with violent responses from authorities,[^8] [^9] [^10] pro-government militias, counterdemonstrators, and militaries. These attacks were answered with violence from protesters in some cases.[^11] [^12] [^13] Multiple large-scale conflicts followed: the [Syrian civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war "Syrian civil war");[^14] [^15] the rise of [ISIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State "Islamic State"),[^16] [insurgency in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_insurgency_\(2011%E2%80%932013\) "Iraqi insurgency (2011–2013)") and the [following civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Iraq_\(2013%E2%80%932017\) "War in Iraq (2013–2017)");[^17] the [Egyptian Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Crisis_\(2011%E2%80%932014\) "Egyptian Crisis (2011–2014)"), [election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Egyptian_presidential_election "2012 Egyptian presidential election") and [removal from office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Egyptian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "2013 Egyptian coup d'état") of [Mohamed Morsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Morsi "Mohamed Morsi"), and [subsequent unrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-coup_unrest_in_Egypt_\(2013%E2%80%932014\) "Post-coup unrest in Egypt (2013–2014)") and [insurgency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_terrorism_in_Egypt_\(2013%E2%80%93present\) "Timeline of terrorism in Egypt (2013–present)");[^18] the [Libyan Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_crisis_\(2011%E2%80%93present\) "Libyan crisis (2011–present)");[^19] and the [Yemeni crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_crisis "Yemeni crisis") and [subsequent civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_\(2014%E2%80%93present\) "Yemeni civil war (2014–present)").[^20] Regimes that lacked major oil wealth and hereditary succession arrangements were more likely to undergo regime change.[^21]

A power struggle continued after the immediate response to the Arab Spring. While leadership changed and regimes were held accountable, [power vacuums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_vacuum "Power vacuum") opened across the Arab world. Ultimately, it resulted in a contentious battle between a consolidation of power by religious elites and the growing support for democracy in many Muslim-majority states.[^22] The early hopes that these popular movements would end corruption, increase political participation, and bring about greater economic equity quickly collapsed in the wake of the [counter-revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-revolutionary "Counter-revolutionary") moves by foreign state actors in Yemen,[^23] the regional and international military interventions in Bahrain and Yemen, and the destructive civil wars in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen.[^24] Some referred to the succeeding and still ongoing conflicts as the [Arab Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Winter "Arab Winter").[^14] [^15] [^17] [^18] [^20]

A new wave of protests began in 2018 which led to the resignation of prime ministers [Haider al-Abadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haider_al-Abadi "Haider al-Abadi") of Iraq in 2018 and [Saad Hariri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saad_Hariri "Saad Hariri") of Lebanon in 2020, and the overthrow of presidents [Omar al-Bashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir "Omar al-Bashir") of Sudan and [Abdelaziz Bouteflika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelaziz_Bouteflika "Abdelaziz Bouteflika") of Algeria in 2019. Sometimes called the [Second Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Arab_Spring "Second Arab Spring"), these events showed how the conditions that started the Arab Spring have not faded and political movements against [authoritarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism "Authoritarianism") and exploitation are still ongoing.[^25] Continued protest movements in Algeria, Sudan, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria have been seen as a continuation of the Arab Spring.[^26] [^27]

As of 2025, multiple conflicts are still continuing which might be seen as originating in the Arab Spring. A major shift in the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war "Syrian civil war") occurred in December 2024 when a rebel offensive led to the [fall of the Assad regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Assad_regime "Fall of the Assad regime"), after over a decade of warfare. In Libya, [a major civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_civil_war_\(2014%E2%80%932020\) "Libyan civil war (2014–2020)") concluded, with foreign powers intervening.[^28] [^29] In Yemen, [a civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_\(2014%E2%80%93present\) "Yemeni civil war (2014–present)") continues to affect the country.[^30]

## Etymology

The denomination "Arab Spring" is contested by some scholars and observers claiming that the term is problematic for several reasons. First, it was coined by Western commentators, not those involved in the events. The first specific use of the term *Arab Spring* as used to denote these events may have started with the US political journal *[Foreign Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Policy "Foreign Policy")*.[^31] Political scientist [Marc Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Lynch "Marc Lynch") described *Arab Spring* as "a term I may have unintentionally coined in a 6 January 2011 article" for *Foreign Policy* magazine.[^32] [^33] Protestors involved in the events however described their own political actions as "uprising" (*intifada*), Arab "awakening" (*sahwa*) and Arab "renaissance" (*nahda*), using expressions like *al-marar al-Arabi* (the Arab bitterness), *karama* (dignity) and *thawra* (revolution).[^4] [^21]

Some authors argue that [western governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world"), scholars and media used the term to minimize people's revolutionary aims and discourse.[^23] [^21] [^26] [Joseph Massad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Massad "Joseph Massad") on *[Al Jazeera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera_Media_Network "Al Jazeera Media Network")* said the term was "part of a US strategy of controlling the movement's aims and goals" and directing it towards Western-style [liberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy "Liberal democracy").[^31] When Arab Spring protests in some countries were followed by electoral success for [Islamist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism "Islamism") parties, some American pundits coined the terms *Islamist Spring* [^34] and *Islamist Winter*.[^35]

The term "Spring" further illustrates the problematic nature of projecting Western expectations onto non-Western actors and practices. The terminology follows the Western example of the [Revolutions of 1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848 "Revolutions of 1848") referred to as "Spring of Nations" and the [Prague Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring "Prague Spring") in 1968, in which a Czech student, [Jan Palach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Palach "Jan Palach"), set himself on fire as [Mohamed Bouazizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi "Mohamed Bouazizi") did. In the aftermath of the [Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War "Iraq War"), it was used by various commentators and bloggers who anticipated a major Arab movement towards [democratization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization "Democratization").[^36] The term "Arab Spring" is thus contested as it signifies an expectation that the events would replicate the example of democratic revolutions set by the West.[^4] [^21]

## Causes

The world watched the events of the Arab Spring unfold, "gripped by the narrative of a young generation peacefully rising up against oppressive authoritarianism to secure a more democratic political system and a brighter economic future".[^24] The Arab Spring is widely believed to have been instigated by dissatisfaction, particularly of youth and unions, with the rule of local governments, though some have speculated that wide gaps in income levels and pressures caused by the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession "Great Recession") may have had a hand as well.[^37] Some activists had taken part in programs sponsored by the US-funded [National Endowment for Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_Democracy "National Endowment for Democracy"), but the US government claimed that they did not initiate the uprisings.[^38]

Numerous factors led to the protests, including issues such as reform,[^39] [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") violations, [political corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption "Political corruption"), economic decline, unemployment, extreme poverty, and a number of demographic structural factors,[^40] such as a large percentage of educated but dissatisfied youth within the entire population.[^41] [^42] Catalysts for the revolts in all [Northern African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa") and [Persian Gulf countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf "Arab states of the Persian Gulf") included the concentration of wealth in the hands of monarchs in power for decades, insufficient transparency of its redistribution, corruption, and especially the refusal of the youth to accept the status quo.[^43]

Some protesters looked to the [Turkish model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_model "Turkish model") as an ideal (contested but peaceful elections, fast-growing but liberal economy, secular constitution but [Islamist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism "Islamism") government).[^44] [^45] [^46] [^47] Other analysts blamed the rise in food prices on commodity traders and the [conversion of crops to ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_ethanol "Corn ethanol").[^48] Yet others have claimed that the context of high rates of unemployment and corrupt political regimes led to dissent movements within the region.[^49] [^50]

### Social media

In the wake of the Arab Spring protests, a considerable amount of attention focused on the role of social media and digital technologies in allowing citizens within areas affected by "the Arab Uprisings" as a means for collective activism to circumvent state-operated media channels.[^51] The influence of social media on political activism during the Arab Spring has, however, been much debated.[^52] [^53] [^54] Protests took place both in states with a very high level of Internet usage (such as [Bahrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain "Bahrain") with 88% of its population online in 2011) and in states with some of the lowest Internet penetration ([Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen") and [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya")).[^55]

The use of social media platforms more than doubled in Arab countries during the protests, with the exception of Libya.[^56] Some researchers have shown how [collective intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence "Collective intelligence"), [dynamics of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology "Crowd psychology") in [participatory systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design#In_software_development "Participatory design") such as social media, has immense power to support a collective action—such as foment a political change.[^57] [^58] As of 5 April 2011, the number of Facebook users in the Arab world surpassed 27.7 million people.[^56] Some critics have argued that digital technologies and other forms of communication—videos, cellular phones, blogs, photos, emails, and text messages—have brought about the concept of a "digital democracy" in parts of North Africa affected by the uprisings.[^59] [^60]

Facebook, Twitter, and other major social media played a key role in the movement of Egyptian and Tunisian activists in particular.[^55] [^61] Nine out of ten Egyptians and Tunisians responded to a poll that they used [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook "Facebook") to organize protests and spread awareness.[^56] This large population of young Egyptian men referred to themselves as "the Facebook generation", exemplifying their escape from their non-modernized past.[^62] Furthermore, 28% of Egyptians and 29% of Tunisians from the same poll said that blocking Facebook greatly hindered and/or disrupted communication. Social media sites were a platform for different movements formed by many frustrated citizens, including the 2008 " [April 6 Youth Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_6_Youth_Movement "April 6 Youth Movement") " organized by Ahmed Mahed, which set out to organize and promote a nationwide labor strike and which inspired the later creation of the "Progressive Youth of Tunisia".[^63]

During the Arab Spring, people created [pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Facebook_features "List of Facebook features") on Facebook to raise awareness about alleged crimes against humanity, such as [police brutality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality "Police brutality") in the Egyptian Revolution (see [Wael Ghonim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wael_Ghonim "Wael Ghonim") and [Death of Khaled Mohamed Saeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Khaled_Mohamed_Saeed "Death of Khaled Mohamed Saeed")).[^64] Whether the project of raising awareness was primarily pursued by Arabs themselves or simply advertised by Western social media users is a matter of debate. Jared Keller, a journalist for [The Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic "The Atlantic"), claims that most activists and protesters used Facebook (among other social media) to organize; however, what influenced Iran was "good old-fashioned word of mouth". Jared Keller argued that the sudden and anomalous social media output was caused from Westerners witnessing the situation(s), and then broadcasting them. The Middle East and North Africa used texting, emailing, and blogging only to organize and communicate information about internal local protests.[^65]

A study by [Zeynep Tufekci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeynep_Tufekci "Zeynep Tufekci") of the [University of North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina "University of North Carolina") and Christopher Wilson of the [United Nations Development Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme "United Nations Development Programme") concluded that "social media in general, and Facebook in particular, provided new sources of information the regime could not easily control and were crucial in shaping how citizens made individual decisions about participating in protests, the logistics of protest, and the likelihood of success." [^66] Marc Lynch of George Washington University said, "while social media boosters envisioned the creation of a new public sphere based on dialogue and mutual respect, the reality is that Islamists and their adversaries retreat to their respective camps, reinforcing each other's prejudices while throwing the occasional rhetorical bomb across the no-man's land that the center has become." [^66] Lynch also stated in a *Foreign Policy* article, "There is something very different about scrolling through pictures and videos of unified, chanting Yemeni or Egyptian crowds demanding democratic change and waking up to a gory image of a headless 6-year-old girl on your Facebook news feed." [^67]

In the months leading up to events in Tunisia, [Department of Homeland Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Homeland_Security "Department of Homeland Security"), [Customs and Border Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"), Communications Program Manager Jonathan Stevens predicted the use of "collaborative Internet utilities" to effect governmental change. In his thesis, [Webeaucracy: The Collaborative Revolution](http://sdsu-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.10/608/Stevens_Jonathan.pdf) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20190228130402/http://sdsu-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.10/608/Stevens_Jonathan.pdf) 28 February 2019 at the [Wayback Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine "Wayback Machine"), Stevens put forth that unlike writing, printing, and telecommunications, "collaborative Internet utilities" denote a sea-change in the ability of crowds to effect social change. People and collaborative Internet utilities can be described as actor-networks; the [subitizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing "Subitizing") limit (and history) suggests people left to their own devices cannot fully harness the mental power of crowds. [Metcalfe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law "Metcalfe's law") suggests that as the number of nodes increases, the value of collaborative actor-networks increases quadratically; collaborative Internet utilities effectively increase the subitizing limit, and, at some macro scale, these interactive collaborative actor-networks can be described by the same rules that govern [Parallel Distributed Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Distributed_Processing "Parallel Distributed Processing"), resulting in crowd sourcing that acts as a type of distributed collective consciousness. The Internet assumes the role of earlier totemic religious figureheads, uniting the members of society through mechanical solidarity forming a collective consciousness. Through many-to-many collaborative Internet utilities, the [Webeaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Webeaucracy&action=edit&redlink=1 "Webeaucracy (page does not exist)") is empowered as never before.[^68]

Social networks were not the only instrument for rebels to coordinate their efforts and communicate. In the countries with the lowest Internet penetration and the limited role of social networks, such as [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen") and [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya"), the role of mainstream electronic media devices—cellular phones, emails, and video clips (e.g., [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube"))—was very important to cast the light on the situation in the country and spread the word about the protests in the outside world.[^55] In [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"), in [Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo") particularly, [mosques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque "Mosque") were one of the main platforms to coordinate the protest actions and raise awareness to the masses.[^69]

Conversely, scholarship literature on the Middle East, political scientist Gregory Gause has found, had failed to predict the events of the Arab uprisings. Commenting on an early article by Gause whose review of a decade of Middle Eastern studies led him to conclude that almost no scholar foresaw what was coming, Chair of Ottoman and Turkish Studies at Tel Aviv University Ehud R. Toledano writes that Gause's finding is "a strong and sincere *mea culpa* " and that his criticism of Middle East experts for "underestimating the hidden forces driving change... while they worked instead to explain the unshakable stability of repressive authoritarian regimes" is well-placed. Toledano then quotes Gause saying, "As they wipe the egg off their faces," those experts "need to reconsider long-held assumptions about the Arab world." [^70]

## Timeline

## History

[Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia "Tunisia") experienced a series of conflicts during the three years leading up to the Arab Spring, the [most notable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Tunisian_protests "2008 Tunisian protests") occurring in the mining area of [Gafsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gafsa "Gafsa") in 2008, where protests continued for many months. These protests included rallies, sit-ins, and strikes, during which there were two fatalities, an unspecified number of wounded, and dozens of arrests.[^71] [^72]

In [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"), the labor movement had been strong for years, with more than 3000 labor actions since 2004, and provided an important venue for organizing protests and collective action.[^73] One important demonstration was [an attempted workers' strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Egyptian_general_strike "2008 Egyptian general strike") on 6 April 2008 at the state-run textile factories of [al-Mahalla al-Kubra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mahalla_El_Kubra "El Mahalla El Kubra"), just outside [Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo"). The idea for this type of demonstration spread throughout the country, promoted by computer-literate working-class youths and their supporters among middle-class college students.[^73] A Facebook page, set up to promote the strike, attracted tens of thousands of followers and provided the platform for sustained political action in pursuit of the "long revolution".[^42] The government mobilized to break the strike through infiltration and riot police, and while the regime was somewhat successful in forestalling a strike, dissidents formed the "6 April Committee" of youths and labor activists, which became one of the major forces calling for the anti- [Mubarak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak "Hosni Mubarak") demonstration on 25 January in [Tahrir Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_Square "Tahrir Square").[^73]

In [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria"), discontent had been building for years over a number of issues. In February 2008, US Ambassador Robert Ford wrote in a leaked diplomatic cable that [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria") is "unhappy" with long-standing political alienation; that social discontent persisted throughout the country, with food strikes occurring almost every week; that there were demonstrations every day somewhere in the country; and that the Algerian government was corrupt and fragile. Some claimed that during 2010 there were as many as "9,700 riots and unrests" throughout the country.[^74] Many protests focused on issues such as education and health care, while others cited rampant corruption.[^75]

In Western Sahara, the [Gdeim Izik protest camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdeim_Izik_protest_camp "Gdeim Izik protest camp") was erected 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) southeast of [El Aaiún](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laayoune "Laayoune") by a group of young [Sahrawis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_people "Sahrawi people") on 9 October 2010. Their intention was to demonstrate against labor discrimination, unemployment, looting of resources, and human rights abuses.[^76] The camp contained between 12 000 and 20 000 inhabitants, but on 8 November 2010 it was destroyed and its inhabitants evicted by Moroccan security forces. The security forces faced strong opposition from some young Sahrawi civilians, and rioting soon spread to El Aaiún and other towns within the territory, resulting in an unknown number of injuries and deaths. Violence against Sahrawis in the aftermath of the protests was cited as a reason for [renewed protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Western_Saharan_protests "2011 Western Saharan protests") months later, after the start of the Arab Spring.[^77]

The catalyst for the escalation of protests was the self-immolation of Tunisian [Mohamed Bouazizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi "Mohamed Bouazizi"). Unable to find work and selling fruit at a roadside stand, Bouazizi had his wares confiscated by a municipal inspector on 17 December 2010. An hour later he doused himself with gasoline and set himself afire. His death on 4 January 2011 [^78] brought together various groups dissatisfied with the existing system, including many unemployed persons, political and human rights activists, labor and trade unionists, students, professors, lawyers, and others to begin the [Tunisian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Revolution "Tunisian Revolution").[^71]

The series of protests and demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa that commenced in 2010 became known as the "Arab Spring",[^79] [^80] [^81] and sometimes as the "Arab Spring and Winter",[^82] "Arab Awakening",[^83] [^84] or "Arab Uprisings",[^85] [^86] even though not all the participants in the protests were [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs"). It was sparked by the first protests that occurred in [Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia "Tunisia") on 18 December 2010 in Sidi Bouzid, following [Mohamed Bouazizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi "Mohamed Bouazizi") 's [self-immolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation "Self-immolation") in protest of police corruption and ill treatment.[^87] [^88] With the success of the protests in Tunisia, a [wave of unrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_wave "Revolutionary wave") sparked by the [Tunisian "Burning Man"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi "Mohamed Bouazizi") struck [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria"), [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan"), [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"), and [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen"),[^89] then spread to other countries. The largest, most organized demonstrations often occurred on a "day of rage", usually Friday afternoon prayers.[^90] [^91] [^92] The protests also triggered similar unrest [outside the region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_Arab_Spring "Impact of the Arab Spring"). Contrary to expectations the revolutions were not led by Islamists:

> Even though the Islamists were certainly present during the uprisings, they never determined the directions of these movements—after all, there was hardly any central leadership in any of the uprisings. Some Islamist groups initially were even reluctant to join in the protests, and the major religious groups in Egypt— [Salafis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafis "Salafis"), [al-Azhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Azhar "Al-Azhar"), and the [Coptic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Church "Coptic Church") —initially opposed the revolution. The mufti of Egypt, [Ali Gomaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Gomaa "Ali Gomaa"), proclaimed that rising against a lawful ruler—President Mubarak—was *haram*, not permissible. And the [Muslim Brotherhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood "Muslim Brotherhood") 's old guard joined in the protests reluctantly only after being pushed by the group's young people.[^93]

The Arab Spring caused the "biggest transformation of the Middle East since decolonization".[^94] By the end of February 2012, rulers had been forced from power in [Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Revolution "Tunisian Revolution"),[^95] [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_revolution_of_2011 "Egyptian revolution of 2011"),[^96] [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_\(2011\) "Libyan Civil War (2011)"),[^97] and [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Revolution "Yemeni Revolution");[^98] civil uprisings had erupted [in Bahrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahraini_uprising_of_2011 "Bahraini uprising of 2011") [^99] and [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_uprising_phase_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War "Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War");[^100] major protests had broken out [in Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9312_Algerian_protests "2010–12 Algerian protests"),[^101] [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Iraqi_protests "2011 Iraqi protests"),[^102] [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_Jordanian_protests "2011–12 Jordanian protests"),[^103] [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwaiti_protests_\(2011%E2%80%9312\) "Kuwaiti protests (2011–12)"),[^104] [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932012_Moroccan_protests "2011–2012 Moroccan protests"),[^105] [Oman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Omani_protests "2011 Omani protests"),[^106] and [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932013_Sudanese_protests "2011–2013 Sudanese protests");[^107] and minor protests had occurred [in Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_Mauritanian_protests "2011–12 Mauritanian protests"),[^108] [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_Saudi_Arabian_protests "2011–12 Saudi Arabian protests"),[^109] [Djibouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Djiboutian_protests "2011 Djiboutian protests"),[^110] [Western Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Western_Saharan_protests "2011 Western Saharan protests"),[^111] and [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_Palestinian_protests "2011–12 Palestinian protests"). Tunisian President [Zine El Abidine Ben Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali "Zine El Abidine Ben Ali") fled to Saudi Arabia on 14 January 2011 following the [Tunisian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Revolution "Tunisian Revolution") protests. Egyptian [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Egypt "President of Egypt") [Hosni Mubarak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak "Hosni Mubarak") resigned on 11 February 2011 after 18 days of massive protests, ending his 30-year presidency. The [Libyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya") leader [Muammar Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi "Muammar Gaddafi") was overthrown on 23 August 2011, after the [National Transitional Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transitional_Council "National Transitional Council") (NTC) took control of [Bab al-Azizia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab_al-Azizia "Bab al-Azizia"). He was killed on 20 October 2011 in his hometown of [Sirte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirte "Sirte") after the NTC took control of the city. Yemeni President [Ali Abdullah Saleh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh "Ali Abdullah Saleh") signed the GCC power-transfer deal in which a presidential election was held, resulting in his successor [Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdrabbuh_Mansur_Hadi "Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi") formally replacing him as president on 27 February 2012 in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Weapons and [Tuareg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people "Tuareg people") fighters returning from the Libyan Civil War stoked a simmering [conflict in Mali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mali_conflict "Northern Mali conflict") that has been described as 'fallout' from the Arab Spring in [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa").[^112]

During this period, several leaders announced their intentions to step down at the end of their current terms. [Sudanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan "Sudan") President [Omar al-Bashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir "Omar al-Bashir") announced that he would not seek reelection in 2015 (he ultimately retracted his announcement and ran anyway),[^113] as did [Iraqi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq") Prime Minister [Nouri al-Maliki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki "Nouri al-Maliki"), whose term was to end in 2014,[^114] although there were violent demonstrations demanding his immediate resignation in 2011.[^115] Protests in [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan") also caused the sacking of four successive governments [^116] [^117] by [King Abdullah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_II_of_Jordan "Abdullah II of Jordan").[^118] The popular unrest in [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait "Kuwait") also resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister [Nasser Al-Sabah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasser_Al-Sabah "Nasser Al-Sabah") 's cabinet.[^119]

The geopolitical implications of the protests drew global attention.[^120] Some protesters were nominated for the 2011 [Nobel Peace Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize "Nobel Peace Prize").[^121] [Tawakkol Karman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawakkol_Karman "Tawakkol Karman") of Yemen was co-recipient of the [2011 Nobel Peace Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Nobel_Peace_Prize "2011 Nobel Peace Prize") due to her role organizing peaceful protests. In December 2011 *[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* magazine named "The Protester" its " [Person of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year "Time Person of the Year") ".[^122] Spanish photographer [Samuel Aranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Aranda "Samuel Aranda") won the 2011 [World Press Photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Photo "World Press Photo") award for his image of a Yemeni woman holding an injured family member, taken during the civil uprising in Yemen on 15 October 2011.[^123]

### Major events

#### Bahrain (2011)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Hundreds_of_thousands_of_Bahrainis_taking_part_in_march_of_loyalty_to_martyrs.jpg/250px-Hundreds_of_thousands_of_Bahrainis_taking_part_in_march_of_loyalty_to_martyrs.jpg)

Over 100 000 Bahrainis taking part in the " March of Loyalty to Martyrs " in Manama honoring political dissidents killed by security forces

The protests in Bahrain started on [14 February](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Rage_\(Bahrain\) "Day of Rage (Bahrain)"), and were initially aimed at achieving greater [political freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom "Political freedom") and respect for [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Bahrain "Human rights in Bahrain"); they were not intended to directly threaten the [monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Bahrain "King of Bahrain").[^99] [^213]<sup><span title="Pages: 162–3">: 162–3 </span></sup>  Lingering frustration among the [Shiite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam "Shia Islam") majority with being ruled by the Sunni government was a major root cause, but the protests in Tunisia and Egypt are cited as the inspiration for the demonstrations.[^99] [^213]<sup><span title="Page: 65">: 65 </span></sup>  The protests were largely peaceful until a pre-dawn raid by police on [17 February](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_Bloody_Thursday "Bahrain Bloody Thursday") to clear protestors from [Pearl Roundabout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Roundabout "Pearl Roundabout") in [Manama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manama "Manama"), in which police killed four protesters.[^213]<sup><span title="Pages: 73–4">: 73–4 </span></sup>  Following the raid, some protesters began to expand their aims to a call for the end of the monarchy.[^214] On 18 February, [army forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_Defence_Force "Bahrain Defence Force") opened fire on protesters when they tried to reenter the roundabout, [fatally wounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Abdulredha_Buhmaid "Death of Abdulredha Buhmaid") one.[^213]<sup><span title="Pages: 77–8">: 77–8 </span></sup>  The following day protesters reoccupied Pearl Roundabout after the government ordered troops and police to withdraw.[^213]<sup><span title="Page: 81">: 81 </span></sup>  [^215] Subsequent days saw large demonstrations; on 21 February a pro-government Gathering of National Unity drew tens of thousands,[^213]<sup><span title="Page: 86">: 86 </span></sup>  [^216] whilst on 22 February the number of protestors at the Pearl Roundabout peaked at over 150 000 after more than 100 000 protesters [marched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_loyalty_to_martyrs "March of loyalty to martyrs") there and were coming under fire from the Bahraini Military which killed around 20 and injured over 100 protestors.[^213]<sup><span title="Page: 88">: 88 </span></sup>  On 14 March, [GCC forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula_Shield_Force "Peninsula Shield Force") (composed mainly of Saudi and UAE troops) were requested by the government and occupied the country.[^213]<sup><span title="Page: 132">: 132 </span></sup>  [^217]

[King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamad_bin_Isa_Al_Khalifa "Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa") declared a three-month [state of emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency "State of emergency") on 15 March and asked the military to reassert its control as clashes spread across the country.[^213]<sup><span title="Page: 139">: 139 </span></sup>  [^218] On 16 March, armed soldiers and riot police cleared the protesters' camp in the Pearl Roundabout, in which 3 policemen and 3 protesters were reportedly killed.[^213]<sup><span title="Pages: 133–4">: 133–4 </span></sup>  [^219] Later, on 18 March, the government tore down Pearl Roundabout monument.[^213]<sup><span title="Pages: 150">: 150 </span></sup>  [^220] After the lifting of emergency law on 1 June,[^221] several large rallies were staged by the opposition parties.[^222] Smaller-scale protests and clashes outside of the capital have continued to occur almost daily.[^223] [^224] On 9 March 2012, over 100 000 protested in what the opposition called "the biggest march in our history".[^225] [^226]

The police response has been described as a "brutal" crackdown on peaceful and unarmed protestors, including doctors and bloggers.[^227] [^228] [^229] The police carried out midnight house raids in [Shia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam "Shia Islam") neighbourhoods, beatings at checkpoints, and denial of medical care in a "campaign of intimidation".[^230] [^231] [^232] [^233] More than 2,929 people have been arrested,[^234] [^235] and at least five people died due to torture while in police custody.[^213]<sup><span title="Page: 287,288">: 287,288 </span></sup>  On 23 November 2011, the [Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_Independent_Commission_of_Inquiry "Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry") released its report on its investigation of the events, finding that the government had systematically tortured prisoners and committed other human rights violations.[^213]<sup><span title="Pages: 415–422">: 415–422 </span></sup>  It also rejected the government's claims that the protests were instigated by [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran").[^236] Although the report found that systematic torture had stopped,[^213]<sup><span title="Pages: 417">: 417 </span></sup>  the Bahraini government has refused entry to several international human rights groups and news organizations, and delayed a visit by a [UN inspector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_E._M%C3%A9ndez "Juan E. Méndez").[^237] [^238] More than 80 people had [died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Bahraini_uprising_of_2011_and_its_aftermath "Casualties of the Bahraini uprising of 2011 and its aftermath") since the start of the uprising.[^239]

Even a decade after the 2011 uprisings, the situation in Bahrain remained unchanged. The regime continued suppression against all forms of dissent. Years after the demonstrations, the Bahraini authorities are known to have accelerated their crackdown. They have been targeting human rights defenders, journalists, Shiite political groups and social media critics.[^240]

#### Saudi Arabia

Saudi government forces quashed [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932012_Saudi_Arabian_protests "2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests") in the country and assisted Bahraini authorities in suppressing demonstrations there.

[Jamal Khashoggi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi "Jamal Khashoggi"), a Saudi critic, covered the Arab Spring and spoke out against the Saudi government during this time. He was murdered by the government a few years later.[^241]

#### Egypt (2011)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Tahrir_Square_on_February11.png/250px-Tahrir_Square_on_February11.png)

Celebrations in Tahrir Square after Omar Suleiman 's statement concerning Hosni Mubarak 's resignation

Inspired by the uprising in Tunisia and prior to his entry as a central figure in Egyptian politics, potential [presidential candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_presidential_election "2011 Egyptian presidential election") [Mohamed ElBaradei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_ElBaradei "Mohamed ElBaradei") warned of a "Tunisia-style explosion" in Egypt.[^242]

Protests in Egypt began on 25 January 2011 and ran for 18 days. Beginning around midnight on 28 January, the Egyptian government attempted, somewhat successfully, to eliminate the nation's Internet access,[^243] in order to inhibit the protesters' ability to use [media activism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_activism "Media activism") to organize through [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media").[^244] Later that day, as tens of thousands protested on the streets of Egypt's major cities, President [Hosni Mubarak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak "Hosni Mubarak") dismissed his government, later appointing a new cabinet. Mubarak also appointed the first Vice President in almost 30 years.

The U.S. embassy and international students began a voluntary evacuation near the end of January, as violence and rumors of violence escalated.[^245] [^246]

On 10 February, Mubarak ceded all presidential power to Vice President [Omar Suleiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Suleiman_\(politician\) "Omar Suleiman (politician)"), but soon thereafter announced that he would remain as president until the end of his term.[^247] However, protests continued the next day, and Suleiman quickly announced that Mubarak had resigned from the presidency and transferred power to the [Armed Forces of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Council_of_the_Armed_Forces "Supreme Council of the Armed Forces").[^248] The military immediately dissolved the [Egyptian Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Egypt "Parliament of Egypt"), suspended the [Constitution of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Egypt "Constitution of Egypt"), and promised to lift the nation's thirty-year " [emergency laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_law_in_Egypt "Emergency law in Egypt") ". A civilian, [Essam Sharaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essam_Sharaf "Essam Sharaf"), was appointed as [Prime Minister of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Egypt "Prime Minister of Egypt") on 4 March to widespread approval among Egyptians in [Tahrir Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_Square "Tahrir Square").[^249] Violent protests, however, continued through the end of 2011 as many Egyptians expressed concern about the [Supreme Council of the Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Council_of_the_Armed_Forces "Supreme Council of the Armed Forces") ' perceived sluggishness in instituting reforms and their grip on power.[^250]

Demonstration in Cairo in solidarity with protestors in Syria, 4 February 2012

Hosni Mubarak and his former interior minister [Habib el-Adly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habib_el-Adly "Habib el-Adly") were sentenced to life in prison on the basis of their failure to stop the killings during the first six days of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.[^251] His successor, the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Islamist [Mohamed Morsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Morsi "Mohamed Morsi"), won a [presidential election in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Egyptian_presidential_election "2012 Egyptian presidential election") regarded as free and fair by election observers, and was subsequently sworn in before judges at the [Supreme Constitutional Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Constitutional_Court_\(Egypt\) "Supreme Constitutional Court (Egypt)").[^252] [Fresh protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Egyptian_protests "2012–13 Egyptian protests") against Morsi erupted in Egypt on 22 November 2012. More [protests against Morsi's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2013_Egyptian_protests "June 2013 Egyptian protests") occurred one year into Morsi's presidency in June 2013, and on 3 July 2013, the military [overthrew Morsi's government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Egyptian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "2013 Egyptian coup d'état"), thus removing him from office.[^253]

The Arab Spring was generally considered to have been a success in Egypt, much like in Tunisia. However, a December 2020 report published by PRI's *[The World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_\(radio_program\) "The World (radio program)")*, a US-based public radio news magazine, suggests otherwise. The report says that the Egyptian government increased the amount of [executions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Egypt "Capital punishment in Egypt") that it carried out by more than twofold, with the report saying that the government put to death approximately 60 people. This number, according to the report, included human rights activists of the [Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Initiative_for_Personal_Rights "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights") (EIPR), who were arrested in November 2020. The executive director of the Project on Middle East Democracy, Stephen McInerney, said that a majority of pro-democracy activists had escaped Egypt, while those who could not had gone into hiding. The Project on Middle East Democracy mentioned using encrypted communication channels to talk to the activists regarding the protection of their whereabouts. Western countries are perceived to have generally overlooked these issues, including the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), and several other European countries. The founder of the [Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_Institute_for_Middle_East_Policy "Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy") in [Washington, DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") believed that even ten years after the Arab Spring, Egypt was at its lowest for human rights.[^254]

#### Libya (2011)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Demonstration_in_Al_Bayda_%28Libya%2C_2011-07-22%29.jpg/250px-Demonstration_in_Al_Bayda_%28Libya%2C_2011-07-22%29.jpg)

Thousands of demonstrators gather in Bayda.

Anti-government protests began in Libya on 15 February 2011. By 18 February, the opposition controlled most of [Benghazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi "Benghazi"), the country's second-largest city. The government dispatched elite troops and militia in an attempt to recapture it, but they were repelled. By 20 February, protests had spread to the capital [Tripoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya "Tripoli, Libya"), leading to a television address by [Saif al-Islam Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saif_al-Islam_Gaddafi "Saif al-Islam Gaddafi"), who warned the protestors that their country could descend into civil war. The rising death toll, numbering in the thousands, drew international condemnation and resulted in the resignation of several Libyan diplomats, along with calls for the government's dismantlement.[^255]

Amidst ongoing efforts by demonstrators and rebel forces to wrest control of Tripoli from the [Jamahiriya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi#Great_Socialist_People's_Libyan_Arab_Jamahiriya_\(1977%E2%80%932011\) "History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi"), the opposition set up an [interim government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transitional_Council "National Transitional Council") in Benghazi to oppose Colonel [Muammar Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi "Muammar Gaddafi") 's rule.[^256] However, despite initial opposition success, government forces subsequently took back much of the Mediterranean coast.

On 17 March, [United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973") was adopted, authorising a [no-fly zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-fly_zone "No-fly zone") over Libya, and "all necessary measures" to protect civilians. Two days later, France, the United States and the United Kingdom [intervened in Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya "2011 military intervention in Libya") with a bombing campaign against pro-Gaddafi forces. A coalition of 27 states from Europe and the Middle East soon joined the intervention. The forces were driven back from the outskirts of Benghazi, and the rebels [mounted an offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Gulf_of_Sidra_offensive "First Gulf of Sidra offensive"), capturing scores of towns across the coast of Libya. The offensive stalled however, and a counter-offensive by the government retook most of the towns, until a [stalemate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Brega%E2%80%93Ajdabiya_road "Battle of Brega–Ajdabiya road") was formed between [Brega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brega "Brega") and [Ajdabiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdabiya "Ajdabiya"), the former being held by the government and the latter in the hands of the rebels. Focus then shifted to the west of the country, where bitter fighting continued. After a [three-month-long battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Misrata_\(2011\) "Battle of Misrata (2011)"), a loyalist siege of rebel-held [Misrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrata "Misrata"), the third largest city in Libya, was broken in large part due to coalition air strikes. The four major fronts of combat were generally considered to be the [Nafusa Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafusa_Mountains "Nafusa Mountains"), the [Tripolitanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania "Tripolitania") coast, the [Gulf of Sidra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Sirte "Gulf of Sirte"),[^257] and the southern [Libyan Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Desert "Libyan Desert").[^258]

In late August, anti-Gaddafi fighters [captured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tripoli_\(2011\) "Battle of Tripoli (2011)") [Tripoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya "Tripoli, Libya"), scattering Gaddafi's government and marking the end of his 42 years of power. Many institutions of the government, including Gaddafi and several top government officials, regrouped in [Sirte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirte "Sirte"), which Gaddafi declared to be Libya's new capital.[^259] Others fled to [Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabha,_Libya "Sabha, Libya"), [Bani Walid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bani_Walid "Bani Walid"), and remote reaches of the [Libyan Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Desert "Libyan Desert"), or to surrounding countries.[^260] [^261] However, Sabha [fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sabha "Battle of Sabha") in late September,[^262] Bani Walid was captured after a [grueling siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bani_Walid "Battle of Bani Walid") weeks later,[^263] and on 20 October, fighters under the aegis of the [National Transitional Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transitional_Council "National Transitional Council") [seized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sirte_\(2011\) "Battle of Sirte (2011)") Sirte, [killing Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Muammar_Gaddafi "Death of Muammar Gaddafi") in the process.[^264] However, after Gaddafi was killed, the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Crisis_\(2011%E2%80%93present\) "Libyan Crisis (2011–present)") continued.

Anti-government demonstrations in Baniyas

Protests in Syria started on 26 January 2011, when a police officer assaulted a man in public at "Al-Hareeka Street" in old Damascus. The man was arrested right after the assault. As a result, protesters called for the freedom of the arrested man. Soon a "day of rage" was set for 4–5 February, but it was uneventful.[^265] [^266] On 6 March, the Syrian security forces arrested about 15 children in Daraa, in southern Syria, for writing slogans against the government. Soon protests erupted over the arrest and abuse of the children. [Daraa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daraa "Daraa") was to be the first city to protest against the [Ba'athist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Socialist_Ba%27ath_Party_%E2%80%93_Syria_Region "Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region") government, which has been ruling [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria") since 1963.[^267]

Thousands of protesters gathered in [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus"), [Aleppo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo "Aleppo"), [al-Hasakah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hasakah "Al-Hasakah"), [Daraa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daraa "Daraa"), [Deir ez-Zor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_ez-Zor "Deir ez-Zor"), and [Hama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama "Hama") on 15 March,[^268] [^269] with recently released politician [Suhair Atassi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suheir_Atassi "Suheir Atassi") becoming an unofficial spokesperson for the "Syrian revolution".[^270] The next day there were reports of approximately 3000 arrests and a few casualties, but there are no official figures on the number of deaths.[^271] On 18 April 2011, approximately 100,000 protesters sat in the central Square of Homs calling for the resignation of president [Bashar al-Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad "Bashar al-Assad"). Protests continued through July 2011, the government responding with harsh security clampdowns and military operations in several districts, especially in the north.[^272] On 31 July, Syrian army tanks stormed several cities, including Hama, Deir Ez-Zour, [Abu Kamal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Kamal "Abu Kamal"), and [Herak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hirak,_Syria "Al-Hirak, Syria") near Daraa. At least 136 people were killed, the highest death toll in any day since the start of the uprising.[^273] On 5 August 2011, an anti-government demonstration took place in Syria called "God is with us", during which the Syrian security forces shot the protesters from inside the ambulances, killing 11 people.[^274] The Arab Spring events in Syria subsequently escalated into the [Syrian civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war "Syrian civil war"). The war caused massive political instability and economic hardship in Syria, with the [Syrian pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_pound "Syrian pound") plunging to new lows.[^275]

On 8 December 2024, the [Assad regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assad_regime "Assad regime") collapsed during a [major offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Syrian_opposition_offensives "2024 Syrian opposition offensives") by [opposition forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_opposition "Syrian opposition"). The offensive was spearheaded by [Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay%27at_Tahrir_al-Sham "Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham") (HTS) and supported mainly by the Turkish-backed [Syrian National Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_National_Army "Syrian National Army"). As [another rebel coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Operations_Room "Southern Operations Room") advanced towards [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus"), reports emerged that [Bashar al-Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad "Bashar al-Assad") fled the capital aboard a plane to Russia, where he joined his family, already in exile, and was granted [asylum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum "Right of asylum").[^276] Following Assad's departure, opposition forces declared victory on state television. Concurrently, the [Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs "Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs") confirmed Assad's resignation and his departure from Syria.[^277] [^278] [^279]

The fall of the Assad regime after 54 years of rule and 13 years of civil war was met with shock and surprise throughout Syria and the world. Syrian opposition fighters were surprised at how quickly the Syrian government collapsed in the wake of their offensive.[^280] Analysts viewed the event as a significant blow to Iran's [Axis of Resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance") due to the use of Syria as a waypoint to supply arms and supplies to their ally [Hezbollah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah").[^281] [^282]

#### Tunisia (2010–2011)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Tunisia_Unrest_-_VOA_-_Tunis_14_Jan_2011_%282%29.jpg/250px-Tunisia_Unrest_-_VOA_-_Tunis_14_Jan_2011_%282%29.jpg)

Protesters on Avenue Habib Bourguiba, downtown Tunis on 14 January 2011, a few hours before president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country

Following the self-immolation of [Mohamed Bouazizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi "Mohamed Bouazizi") in [Sidi Bouzid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Bouzid "Sidi Bouzid"), a series of increasingly violent street demonstrations through December 2010 ultimately led to the ousting of longtime [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Tunisia "President of Tunisia") [Zine El Abidine Ben Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali "Zine El Abidine Ben Ali") on 14 January 2011. The demonstrations were preceded by high unemployment, [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food "Food") [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation"), corruption,[^283] lack of [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech") and other forms of [political freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom "Political freedom"),[^284] and poor [living conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitability "Habitability"). The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades [^285] [^286] and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. Ben Ali fled into exile in [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia"), ending his 23 years in power.[^287]

A [state of emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency "State of emergency") was declared and a caretaker coalition government was created following Ben Ali's departure, which included members of Ben Ali's party, the [Constitutional Democratic Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Constitutional_Rally "Democratic Constitutional Rally") (RCD), as well as opposition figures from other ministries. The five newly appointed non-RCD ministers resigned almost immediately.[^288] [^289] As a result of continued daily protests, on 27 January Prime Minister [Mohamed Ghannouchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Ghannouchi "Mohamed Ghannouchi") reshuffled the government, removing all former RCD members other than himself, and on 6 February the former ruling party was suspended;[^290] later, on 9 March, it was dissolved.[^291] Following further public protests, Ghannouchi himself resigned on 27 February, and [Beji Caid Essebsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beji_Caid_Essebsi "Beji Caid Essebsi") became prime minister.

On 23 October 2011 Tunisians voted in the first post-revolution election to elect representatives to a 217-member [constituent assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tunisian_Constituent_Assembly_election "2011 Tunisian Constituent Assembly election") that would be responsible for the new constitution.[^292] The leading Islamist party, [Ennahda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennahda_Movement "Ennahda Movement"), won 37% of the vote, and elected 42 women to the Constituent Assembly.[^293]

On 26 January 2014 a [new constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Constitution_of_2014 "Tunisian Constitution of 2014") was adopted.[^294] The constitution is seen as progressive, increasing human rights, gender equality, and government duties toward people, laying the groundwork for a new parliamentary system and making Tunisia a decentralized and [open government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government "Open government").[^294] [^295]

On 26 October 2014 Tunisia held its first [parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Tunisian_parliamentary_election "2014 Tunisian parliamentary election") since the 2011 Arab Spring [^296] and its [presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Tunisian_presidential_election "2014 Tunisian presidential election") on 23 November 2014,[^297] finishing its transition to a democratic state. These elections were characterized by a decline in Ennahdha's popularity in favor of the secular [Nidaa Tounes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidaa_Tounes "Nidaa Tounes") party, which became the first party of the country.[^298]

There were large protests against the government United Arab Emirates.[^299] In the United Arab Emirates, the Arab Spring saw a sudden and intense demand for democratic reforms. However, government repression of human rights, including unlawful detentions and torture, quelled the opposition and silenced dissenters. Even years after the Arab Spring uprisings, the Emirates remain in staunch opposition to free speech.[^300] [^301]

In 2011, 133 peaceful political [activists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activists "Activists") —including academics and members of a social organization, [Islah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Islah_\(United_Arab_Emirates\) "Al Islah (United Arab Emirates)") —signed a petition calling for democratic reforms. Submitted to the Emirati monarch rulers, the petition demanded elections, more legislative powers for the [Federal National Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_National_Council "Federal National Council") and an independent judiciary.[^302]

In 2012, the authorities arrested 94 of the 133 [journalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalists "Journalists"), government officials, judges, [lawyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyers "Lawyers"), teachers and student activists, who were detained in secret detention facilities. For a year, until the trial began in March 2013, the 94 prisoners were subjected to [enforced disappearances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance "Forced disappearance") and [torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture "Torture"). As the "unfair" trial ended on 2 July 2013, 69 men were convicted on the basis of evidence acquired through forced confessions, and received harsh prison sentences of up to 15 years.[^303]

The case came to be known as "UAE-94", following which [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech") was further curbed. For years, these prisoners have been under [arbitrary detention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_detention "Arbitrary detention"), with some "held in [incommunicado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement "Solitary confinement"), and denied their rights". In July 2021, [Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International") called the UAE authorities to immediately release 60 prisoners of the UAE-94 case, who remained detained nine years after their arrest.[^304]

At least 51 prisoners, who were part of the "UAE-94" mass trial, were being imprisoned despite completing their sentences. Some prisoners completed their sentences in March 2023, while others completed it as early as July 2019. HRW said that those the prisoners continued to remain in prison without a proper legal basis, even after completing the sentences between one month and nearly four years before.[^305]

Following the 2011 petition, the UAE authorities also arrested five prominent [human rights defenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_defenders "Human rights defenders") and government critics who did not sign the petition. All were pardoned the next day but have been facing a number of unfair acts of the government. One of the prominent Emirati activists, [Ahmed Mansoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Mansoor "Ahmed Mansoor"), reported being beaten twice since then. His passport was confiscated and nearly $ 140 000 were stolen from his personal bank account. Most of the human rights activists have been victims of the UAE government's intimidation for years.[^302]

The authorities also exiled a local man to Thailand. He spoke out about the government.[^306]

In 2015 it was revealed that there was a [foiled palace coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Dhabyani_coup_attempt "2011 Dhabyani coup attempt") in Abu Dhabi in mid-2011 where [Hamdan Al Nahyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamdan_bin_Zayed_bin_Sultan_Al_Nahyan "Hamdan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan") attempted to overthrow his brother [Khalifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_bin_Zayed_Al_Nahyan "Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan") and implement reforms such as universal Arab resident suffrage, and empowering the legislature.[^307]

Protests in Sana'a

Protests occurred in many towns in both the north and south of Yemen starting in mid-January 2011. Demonstrators in the [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen "South Yemen") mainly protested against President [Saleh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh "Ali Abdullah Saleh") 's support of [Al Qaeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda") in [South Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen "South Yemen"), the marginalization of the [Southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Movement "Southern Movement") people and the exploitation of Southern natural resources.[^308] [^309] [^310] Other parts of the country initially protested against governmental proposals to modify the [constitution of Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Yemen "Constitution of Yemen"), unemployment and economic conditions,[^311] and corruption,[^312] but their demands soon included a call for the resignation of President [Ali Abdullah Saleh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh "Ali Abdullah Saleh"),[^312] [^313] who had been facing internal opposition from his closest advisors since 2009.[^314]

A major demonstration of over 16 000 protesters took place in [Sanaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanaa "Sanaa") on 27 January 2011,[^315] and soon thereafter [human rights activist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Yemen "Human rights in Yemen") and politician [Tawakkol Karman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawakkol_Karman "Tawakkol Karman") called for a "Day of Rage" on 3 February.[^316] According to *[Xinhua News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency "Xinhua News Agency")*, organizers were calling for a million protesters.[^317] In response to the planned protest, Ali Abdullah Saleh stated that he would not seek another [presidential term in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Yemen "Elections in Yemen").[^318]

On 3 February, 20 000 protesters demonstrated against the government in Sana'a,[^319] [^320] others participated in a "Day of Rage" in Aden [^321] that was called for by [Tawakel Karman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawakel_Karman "Tawakel Karman"),[^316] while soldiers, armed members of the [General People's Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_People%27s_Congress_\(Yemen\) "General People's Congress (Yemen)"), and many protestors held a pro-government rally in Sana'a.[^322] Concurrent with the resignation of Egyptian president Mubarak, Yemenis again took to the streets protesting President Saleh on 11 February, in what has been dubbed a "Friday of Rage".[^323] The protests continued in the days following despite clashes with government advocates.[^324] In a "Friday of Anger" held on 18 February, tens of thousands of Yemenis took part in anti-government demonstrations in the major cities of Sana'a, [Taiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiz "Taiz"), and [Aden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden "Aden"). Protests continued over the following months, especially in the three major cities, and briefly intensified in late May into urban warfare between [Hashid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashid "Hashid") tribesmen and army defectors allied with the opposition on one side and security forces and militias loyal to Saleh on the other.[^325]

After Saleh pretended to accept a [Gulf Cooperation Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council "Gulf Cooperation Council") -brokered plan allowing him to cede power in exchange for immunity from prosecution only to back away before signing three separate times,[^326] [^327] an assassination attempt on 3 June left him and several other high-ranking Yemeni officials injured by a blast in the presidential compound's mosque.[^328] Saleh was evacuated to [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia") for treatment and handed over power to Vice President [Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdrabbuh_Mansur_Hadi "Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi"), who largely continued his policies [^329] and ordered the arrest of several Yemenis in connection with the attack on the presidential compound.[^328] While in Saudi Arabia, Saleh kept hinting that he could return any time and continued to be present in the political sphere through television appearances from [Riyadh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh "Riyadh") starting with an address to the Yemeni people on 7 July.[^330] On 13 August, a demonstration was announced in Yemen as "Mansouron Friday" in which hundreds of thousands of Yemenis called for Saleh to go. The protesters joining the "Mansouron Friday" were calling for establishment of "a new Yemen".[^331] On 12 September Saleh issued a presidential decree while still receiving treatment in Riyadh authorizing Hadi to negotiate a deal with the opposition and sign the GCC initiative.

On 23 September, three months since the assassination attempt, Saleh returned to Yemen abruptly, defying all earlier expectations.[^333] Pressure on Saleh to sign the GCC initiative eventually led to his doing so in Riyadh on 23 November. Saleh thereby agreed to step down and set the stage for the transfer of power to his vice president.[^334] A [presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Yemeni_presidential_election "2012 Yemeni presidential election") was then held on 21 February 2012, in which Hadi (the only candidate) won 99.8% of the vote.[^335] Hadi then took the oath of office in Yemen's parliament on 25 February.[^336] By 27 February Saleh had resigned from the presidency and transferred power to Hadi.[^337] The replacement government was overthrown by Houthi rebels on 22 January 2015, starting the [Yemeni Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_\(2015%E2%80%93present\) "Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)") and the [Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen "Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen").

## Outcomes

### Arab Winter

In the aftermath of the Arab Spring in various countries, there was a wave of violence and instability commonly known as the Arab Winter [^338] or Islamist Winter.[^339] The Arab Winter was characterized by extensive civil wars, general regional instability, economic and demographic decline of the [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") and overall religious wars between Sunni and Shia Muslims.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Libyan_Civil_War.svg/250px-Libyan_Civil_War.svg.png)

Areas of control in the Second Libyan Civil War (2014–2020)

Although the long-term effects of the Arab Spring have yet to be shown, its short-term consequences varied greatly across the Middle East and North Africa. In Tunisia and Egypt, where the existing regimes were ousted and replaced through a process of free and fair election, the revolutions were considered short-term successes.[^340] [^341] [^342] This interpretation is, however, problematized by the subsequent political turmoil that emerged, particularly in Egypt. Elsewhere, most notably in the monarchies of [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco "Morocco") and the [Persian Gulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf"), existing regimes co-opted the Arab Spring movement and managed to maintain order without significant social change.[^343] [^344] In other countries, particularly Syria and Libya, the apparent result of Arab Spring protests was a complete [societal collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_collapse "Societal collapse").[^340]

Social scientists have endeavored to understand the circumstances that led to this variation in outcome. A variety of causal factors have been highlighted, most of which hinge on the relationship between the strength of the state and the strength of civil society. Countries with stronger civil society networks in various forms underwent more successful reforms during the Arab Spring; these findings are also consistent with more general social science theories such as those espoused by [Robert D. Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam "Robert D. Putnam") and [Joel S. Migdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_S._Migdal "Joel S. Migdal").[^345] [^346]

One of the primary influences that have been highlighted in the analysis of the Arab Spring is the relative strength or weakness of a society's formal and informal [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution "Institution") prior to the revolts. When the Arab Spring began, Tunisia had an established infrastructure and a lower level of petty corruption than did other states, such as Libya.[^340] This meant that, following the overthrow of the existing regime, there was less work to be done in reforming Tunisian institutions than elsewhere, and consequently it was less difficult to transition to and consolidate a democratic system of government.[^343] [^347]

Also crucial was the degree of state censorship over print, broadcast, and social media in different countries. Television coverage by channels like [Al Jazeera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera_Media_Network "Al Jazeera Media Network") and [BBC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News "BBC News") provided worldwide exposure and prevented mass violence by the Egyptian government in Tahrir Square, contributing to the success of the Egyptian Revolution. In other countries, such as Libya, Bahrain, and Syria, such international press coverage was not present to the same degree, and the governments of these countries were able to act more freely in suppressing the protests.[^348] [^349] Strong authoritarian regimes with high degrees of censorship in their national broadcast media were able to block communication and prevent the domestic spread of information necessary for successful protests.

Countries with greater access to social media, such as Tunisia and Egypt, proved more effective in mobilizing large groups of people, and appear to have been more successful overall than those with greater state control over media.[^342] [^350] [^351] Although social media played a large role in shaping the events of revolutions social activism did not occur in a vacuum. Without the use of street level organization social activists would not have been as effective.[^352] Even though a revolution did take place and the prior government has been replaced, Tunisia's government can not conclude that another uprising will not take place. There are still many grievances taking place today.[^353]

In Tunisia, due to tourism coming to a halt and other factors during the revolution and Arab Spring movement, the budget deficit has grown and unemployment has risen since 2011.[^354] According to the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank") in 2016, "Unemployment remains at 15.3% from 16.7% in 2011, but still well above the pre-revolution level of 13%." [^354] Large scale emigration brought on by a long and treacherous civil war has permanently harmed the Syrian economy. Projections for economic contraction will remain high at almost 7% in 2017.[^355]

The support, even if tacit, of national military forces during protests has been correlated to the success of the Arab Spring movement in different countries.[^341] [^343] In Egypt and Tunisia, the military actively participated in ousting the incumbent regime and in facilitating the transition to democratic elections. Countries like Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, exhibited a strong mobilization of military force against protesters, effectively ending the revolts in their territories; others, including Libya and Syria, failed to stop the protests entirely and instead ended up in civil war.[^341] The support of the military in Arab Spring protests has also been linked to the degree of ethnic homogeneity in different societies. In Saudi Arabia and Syria, where the ruling elite was closely linked with ethnic or religious subdivisions of society, the military sided with the existing regime and took on the ostensible role of protector to minority populations.[^356]

The presence of a strong, educated middle class has been noted as a correlate to the success of the Arab Spring in different countries.[^357] Countries with strong welfare programs and a weak middle class, such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan, as well as countries with great economic disparity and an impoverished working class—including Yemen, Libya, and Morocco—did not experience successful revolutions. The strength of the middle class is, in turn, directly connected to the existing political, economic, and educational institutions in a country, and the middle class itself may be considered an informal institution.[^358] In very broad terms, this may be reframed in terms of development, as measured by various indicators such as the [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index "Human Development Index"): [rentier states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier_state "Rentier state") such as the oil monarchies of the Persian Gulf exhibited less successful revolutions overall.[^359]

Charting what he calls the 'new masses' of the twenty-first century, Sociologist Göran Therborn draws attention to the historical contradictory role of the middle class. The Egyptian middle class has illustrated this ambivalence and contradiction in 2011 and 2013: "The volatility of middle-class politics is vividly illustrated by the sharp turns in Egypt, from acclamation of democracy to adulation of the military and its mounting repression of dissent, effectively condoning the restoration of the ancien régime minus Mubarak.[^360]

### Long-term aftermath

Some trends in political Islam resulting from the Arab Spring noted by observers (Quinn Mecham and Tarek Osman) include:

- [Repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood_in_Egypt#After_the_July_2013_overthrow_of_Mohamed_Morsi "Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt") of the Muslim Brotherhood, not only in Egypt by the military and courts following the forcible removal of Morsi from office in 2013; but also by Saudi Arabia and a number of Gulf countries (not Qatar).[^361] [^362] [^363] The ambassadors crisis also seriously threatened the GCC's activities, adversely affected its functioning and could arguably even have led to its dissolution.[^363]
- Rise of Islamist [state-building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-building "State-building") where state failure has taken place—most prominently in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. Islamists have found it easier than competing non-Islamists trying to fill the void of state failure, by securing external funding, weaponry and fighters – "many of which have come from abroad and have rallied around a pan-Islamic identity". The norms of governance in these Islamist areas are militia-based, and the governed submit to their authority out of fear, loyalty, other reasons, or some combination.[^361] The "most expansive" of these new "models" is the [Islamic State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant").[^361]
- Increasing sectarianism (primarily Sunni-Shia) at least in part from [proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war "Proxy war") and the escalation of the [Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_proxy_conflict "Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict"). Islamists are fighting Islamists across sectarian lines in Lebanon (Sunni militants targeting [Hezbollah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah") positions), Yemen (between mainstream Sunni Islamists of [al-Islah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Islah_\(Yemen\) "Al-Islah (Yemen)") and the Shiite [Zaydi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaidiyyah "Zaidiyyah") [Houthi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthis "Houthis") movement), in Iraq (Islamic State and Iraqi Shiite militias).[^361]
- Increased caution and political learning in countries such as Algeria and Jordan where Islamists have chosen not to lead a major challenge against their governments. In Yemen, [al-Islah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Islah_\(Yemen\) "Al-Islah (Yemen)") "has sought to frame its ideology in a way that will avoid charges of militancy".[^361]
- In countries where Islamists did choose to lead a major challenge and did not succeed in transforming society (particularly Egypt), a disinterest in "soul-searching" about what went wrong, in favor of "antagonism and fiery anger" and a thirst for revenge. Partisans of political Islam (although this does not include some prominent leaders such as [Rached Ghannouchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rached_Ghannouchi "Rached Ghannouchi") but is particularly true in Egypt) see themselves as victims of an injustice whose perpetrators are not just "individual conspirators but entire social groups".[^364]

"The repercussions of the 2011 uprisings have influenced Middle Eastern youth's experiences providing impetus for questioning perennial sacred beliefs and positions, and forging ahead avant-garde views and responses to the constraints they face." [^24]

Contrary to the common discourse, Hussein Agha and Robert Malley from *[The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")* argue that the divide in the post–Arab Spring in the Middle East is not sectarianism:

> The bloodiest, most vicious, and most pertinent struggles occur squarely inside the Sunni world. Sectarianism is a politically expedient fable, conveniently used to cover up old-fashioned power struggles, maltreatment of minorities, and cruel totalitarian practices.[^365]

Agha and Malley point out that even in Syria there has been a misrepresentation of the conflict, that the [Assad regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assad_regime "Assad regime") relied on an alliance that included middle class Sunnis along with other religious minorities. Prior to the uprising, the Syrian regime enjoyed some financial and political support from Sunni [Gulf states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf "Arab states of the Persian Gulf"). The "select rich urban bourgeoisie, the Sunni Damascene in particular", according to Tokyo University researcher Housam Darwisheh, "now has a direct interest in preserving stability and their relations with the regime as long as their businesses prosper." [^366] In the view of the Arab sociologist [Halim Barakat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halim_Barakat "Halim Barakat"), "the persistence of communal cleavages complicates rather than nullifies social class consciousness and struggles." [^367]

  
The [2018–2024 Arab protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932024_Arab_protests "2018–2024 Arab protests") were a series of anti-government protests which began in several [Arab world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world") countries in 2018.[^368] [^369]

In [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq"), the deadliest incident of civil unrest since the fall of [Saddam Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein "Saddam Hussein") resulted in its [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Iraq "Prime Minister of Iraq") [Adil Abdul-Mahdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adil_Abdul-Mahdi "Adil Abdul-Mahdi") being replaced.[^370] [^371] [^372]

[Sustained civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Revolution "Sudanese Revolution") in [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan "Sudan") resulted in the overthrow of president [Omar al-Bashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir "Omar al-Bashir") in a military [coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Sudanese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "2019 Sudanese coup d'état"),[^373] the [Khartoum massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum_massacre "Khartoum massacre"), and the transfer of power from a military junta to the [Transitional Sovereignty Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_Sovereignty_Council "Transitional Sovereignty Council") but led to a [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_civil_war_\(2023%E2%80%93present\) "Sudanese civil war (2023–present)") in 2023.

In [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria"), a series of [mass protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirak_\(Algeria\) "Hirak (Algeria)") resulted in the resignation of president [Abdelaziz Bouteflika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelaziz_Bouteflika "Abdelaziz Bouteflika"), and the postponement of the [scheduled presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Algerian_presidential_election "2019 Algerian presidential election"). Other protests also took place in [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Egyptian_protests "2019 Egyptian protests"), [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Jordanian_protests "2018 Jordanian protests"), [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17_October_Revolution "17 October Revolution"), [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%932018_Moroccan_protests "2017–2018 Moroccan protests"), [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Syria_protests_\(2023%E2%80%9324\) "Southern Syria protests (2023–24)"), and [Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Tunisian_protests "2018 Tunisian protests"), along with [economic protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Gaza_economic_protests "2019 Gaza economic protests") in the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip").[^374] [^375] [^376] [^377] [^369]

Very few analysts of the Arab societies foresaw a mass movement on such a scale that might threaten the existing order. In his 1993 sociological study of the Arab societies, culture and state, Barakat stated confidently that "one should expect the first Arab popular revolution to take place in Egypt or Tunisia. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that revolutions may occur in more pluralistic societies as well." [^378] What was prevalent, according to the Syrian writer and political dissident [Yassin al-Haj Saleh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yassin_al-Haj_Saleh "Yassin al-Haj Saleh") was three 'springs' that ensured the status quo. One of which was a "spring of despotic states that receive assistance and legitimacy from a world system centered around stability".[^379] Most democracy protests do not result in reforms.[^380]

Two months into the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings, *[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")* magazine in a leader article spoke about a new generation of young people, idealists, "inspired by democracy", which made revolutions. Those revolutions, the article stated, "are going the right way, with a hopeful new mood prevailing and free elections in the offing".[^381] For those on the streets of Egypt the predominant slogan was "bread, freedom and social justice".[^382]

Some observers, however, have questioned the revolutionary nature of the 'Arab Spring'. A social theorist specialising in social movements and social change in the Middle East, [Asef Bayat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asef_Bayat "Asef Bayat"), has provided an analysis based on his decades-long of research as "a participant-observer" (in his own words). In his appraisal of the Arab revolutions, Bayat discerns a remarkable difference between these revolutions and the revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s in countries like Yemen, [Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua "Nicaragua") and Iran. The Arab revolutions, argues Bayat, "lacked any associated intellectual anchor" and the predominant voices, "secular and Islamists alike, took free market, property relations, and neoliberal rationality for granted" and uncritically.[^383] New social movements' define themselves as horizontal networks with aversion to the state and central authority. Thus their "political objective is not to capture the state", a fundamental feature in the twentieth-century revolutionary movements.[^384] Instead of revolution or reform, Bayat speaks of 'refolution'.[^385]

[Wael Ghonim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wael_Ghonim "Wael Ghonim"), an Internet activist who would later gain an international fame, acknowledged that what he had intended by founding a Facebook page was a "simple reaction to the events in Tunisia" and that "there was no master plans or strategies" a priori.[^386] That the objective was reform to be achieved through peaceful means and not revolution was explicitly put forward by [April 6 Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_6_Movement "April 6 Movement"), one of the leading forces of the Egyptian uprising, in their statements. It called for "coalition and co-operation between all factions and national forces to reach the reform and the peaceful change of the conditions of Egypt".[^387] "Even in Tahrir Square with so many people and the rising level of demands," recalls an activist in the movement, "we were very surprised by the people wanting the downfall of the regime; and not a single one of us had expected this." [^388] In comparing the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria, researcher Housam Darwisheh concludes: "The Egyptian uprising, in neither dismantling the ancien regime nor creating new institutional mechanisms to lead the transition, permitted the so-called 'deep state' to reassert itself while the deepening polarization led many non-Islamists to side with the military against the MB \[the Muslim Brotherhood\]." [^389]

According to Cambridge sociologist Hazem Kandil, the [Muslim Brotherhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood "Muslim Brotherhood") did not aim at taking power during the events leading up to the toppling of Mubarak. The biggest and most organised organisation in Egypt in fact negotiated with the regime in "infamous talks between [Morsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morsi "Morsi") and the then vice-president [Omar Suleiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Suleiman_\(politician\) "Omar Suleiman (politician)") ", and "an informal deal was reached: withdraw your members from Tahrir Square, and we allow you to form a political party." Then the Brotherhood wavered whether to file a presidential candidate and did not push for a new constitution, choosing to work with the [Supreme Council of the Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Council_of_the_Armed_Forces "Supreme Council of the Armed Forces") (SCAF):

> The Brotherhood and the Salafists went all-out to keep the existing constitution—originating under Sadat—with a few amendments. The result was irrelevant, because the military scrapped the old constitution anyway. But the Brothers managed to persuade over 70 per cent of the voters, so it became clear to the military that they had far more sway on the street than the secular revolutionaries who had brought down Mubarak, yet seemed incapable of much organization once they had done so. For SCAF, the priority was to bring the street under control, so it decided to start working with the Brotherhood to stabilize the country.[^390]

George Lawson from the [London School of Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_School_of_Economics "London School of Economics") places the Arab uprisings within the post-Cold War world. He characterises the uprisings as "largely unsuccessful revolution" and that they "bare a family resemblance to the 'negotiated revolutions'... Negotiated revolutions... seek to transform political and symbolic fields of action, but without a concomitant commitment to a program of economic transformation." [^391] In this 'negotiated revolution', comments Bayat, "revolutionaries had in effect little part in the 'negotiations'." [^392] What has been treated by some analysts as intellectual weakness of the revolutionary movement is partly due to the pre-2011 stifling cultural environment under repressive regimes. Although Egyptian intellectuals enjoyed a bigger margin of freedom than their counterparts in Tunisia, cultural figures sought protection from political players, and instead of leading criticism, they complied.[^393]

The post-Cold War era saw the emergence of the idea and practice of gradual reform and liberal agenda. It saw an influx of humanitarian projects, [NGOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs "NGOs") and charity work, liberal [think tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tanks "Think tanks") and emphasis on [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society "Civil society") work. This new juncture seemed to have made the idea and prospect of revolution an outdated project. The focus instead shifted to individual freedoms and [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market"). The new idea of [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society "Civil society") was different from the kind of civil society [Antonio Gramsci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci "Antonio Gramsci"), for instance, envisaged: 'a revolution before the revolution'.

In her field study in Yemen, anthropologist Bogumila Hall depicts the effects of what she terms as "the marketization of civil society and its heavy reliance on donors", which "led to a largely depoliticized form of activism that by passed, rather than confronted, the state". Hall, with her focus on the *muhammashīn* (the marginalized) in Yemen, described how in the 1990s and 2000s international NGOs established charity projects and workshops "to teach slum dwellers new skills and behaviours". But, besides the "modest changes" brought by the NGOs, concludes Hall, "delegating the problem of the *muhammashīn* to the realm of development and poverty alleviation, without addressing the structural causes underlying their marginalisation, had a depoliticising effect. It led to a widely held assumption, also shared by the *muhammashīn*, that ending marginalisation was a matter for experts and administrative measures, not politics." [^394]

When Arab regimes viewed NGOs' leaders and other similar organisations with suspicion, accusing Western governments of providing funding and training to 'illegal organisations' and fomenting revolution, diplomatic cables reported "how American officials frequently assured skeptical governments that the training was aimed at reform, not promoting revolutions".[^395] And when the Egyptian uprising was gaining its momentum, the American president [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") "did not suggest that the 82-year-old leader step aside or transfer power... the argument was that he really needed to do the reforms, and do them fast. Former ambassador to Egypt (Frank G.) [Wisner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_G._Wisner "Frank G. Wisner") publicly suggested that Mr. Mubarak had to be at the center of any change, and Secretary of State [Hillary Rodham Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton "Hillary Rodham Clinton") warned that any transition would take time." [^396] Some activists, who read the American thinker and nonviolence advocate [Gene Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Sharp "Gene Sharp"), obtained training from foreign bodies, including the Serbian opposition movement [Otpor!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otpor! "Otpor!"), and April 6 Movement modelled its logo after Otpor's.[^396] Otpor, writes Bayat in his discussion of the agencies of the Arab Spring activism in Tunisia and Egypt, obtained funds from well-known American organisations such as the American [National Endowment for Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_Democracy "National Endowment for Democracy"), [USAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAID "USAID"), and the [International Republican Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Republican_Institute "International Republican Institute"). Thus Otpur, in line with these organisations' advocacies, "pushed for political reform through nonradical, electoral, and market-driven language and practices".[^397]

Early 2019 witnessed two uprisings: one in Algeria and another in Sudan. In Algeria under pressure of weeks of protests, the head of the army forced the ailing twenty-year-serving president, [Abdelaziz Bouteflika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelaziz_Bouteflika "Abdelaziz Bouteflika"), to abdicate. In Sudan, after four months of protests, the Sudani defense minister ousted longtime President [Omar al-Bashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir "Omar al-Bashir") in a coup.[^398] Writing about what he calls "a rebirth of Tahrir Square", the prominent Lebanese novelist and critic [Elias Khoury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Khoury "Elias Khoury"), averred that "perhaps the secret of the Arab Spring lies not in its victories or defeats, but in its ability to liberate people from fear." Despite the "faded spirit of Tahrir Square" and an outcome that Khoury describes as a "monarchy that abrogates legal standards", a renaissance of resistance is unstoppable:

> The defeat of the Arab Spring has seemed likely to extinguish this glimmer of hope, to return the Arab world to the tyrannical duopoly of military and oil and to crush the will of the people in the struggle between Sunni and Shia, between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The combination has thrown the region into Israelʹs lap. But the defeat cannot and will not stop the renaissance. If the Arab world has reached rock bottom, it canʹt go any lower and it canʹt last forever.[^399]

There was a need, suggested Khoury, to turn "the uprisings of the Arab Spring into an intellectual, political and moral project that gives meaning to the goals of freedom, democracy and social justice". From the outset the 2011 Arab uprisings raised the banner of 'social justice'. The concept, what it means and how to achieve it has been a major subject of discussion and contention since then.

### Social justice

In its economic and social manifesto, the Tunisian [Ennahda Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennahda_Movement "Ennahda Movement") states that the movement "adopts the social and solidarised market economy within a national approach based on free economic activity, freedom of ownership, production and administration on the one hand, and social justice and equal opportunities on the other hand" and that "national capital has to be the axis in the development process." [^400] The [Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood_in_Egypt "Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt") mainly focuses on "reform of existing political systems in the Arab world. It embraces the idea of political activism and social responsibility, organising charitable works and social support programmes as part of its outreach to its core support base of lower-income populations." [^401]

On its part the [International Centre for Transitional Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Centre_for_Transitional_Justice "International Centre for Transitional Justice") has set nine 'concrete and tangible' goals with focus on "accountability for serious violations of human rights, access to justice, facilitating peace processes, advancing the cause of reconciliation and reforming the state and social institutions".[^402] One of those goals was taken up by [Truth and Dignity Commission (Tunisia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Dignity_Commission_\(Tunisia\) "Truth and Dignity Commission (Tunisia)") that recorded and submitted to the relevant court the human rights abuses which had been committed by the Tunisian regime. A new climate of freedom of speech, freedom of organisation and elections characterised the political environment of post-Ben Ali Tunisia.

Some observers and social analysts remarked, however, that the issue of [social justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice "Social justice") remained a rhetoric or was marginalised. According to Fathi Al-Shamikhi, an expert in debt issues and founder of the Tunisian association RAID, different social forces played a crucial role in matters related to social demands and achieving social justice. "This role varies between those who advocate these demands and those who reject them, according to the social nature of each of these forces." [^403] "Bread, freedom and social justice" were the main slogans of the Arab revolutions. But although social and economic demands were raised, argued researcher and former editor in chief of the Egyptian [Al-Shorouq](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Shorouq&action=edit&redlink=1 "Al-Shorouq (page does not exist)") Newspaper, Wael Gamal, "they were pushed aside in the political arena, and more attention was given to issues such as the transfer of power arrangements, the constitution first, the elections first, democratic transformation and the religious-secular conflict." [^404]

With the survival of the regime in Egypt and the rolling back of what was gained in the short period after the overthrow of [Mubarak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mubarak "Mubarak"), the persistence, or even the worsening, of the socio-economic conditions that led to the Tunisian uprising, a [Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi-led_intervention_in_Bahrain "Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain") assisted the defeat of the uprising in the country, and especially the descent of other uprisings into brutal civil wars in Syria, Libya and Yemen, with acute humanitarian crises, there are:

> many in capitals around the world who find it convenient to insist that a strongman is needed to deal with the peoples of this region. It is a racist, bigoted argument and should be called out as such, but many political leaders of the region are quite comfortable promoting it. Indeed, many of the counterrevolutionary moves in the region happened precisely because they agree with that argument.[^405]

In April 2019, amidst an offensive to take Libya's capital city. of [Tripoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya "Tripoli, Libya") by military leader [Khalifa Haftar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_Haftar "Khalifa Haftar"), for whom U.S. President Donald Trump had voiced his support, the Syrian policy scholar Marwan Kabalan argued in an opinion piece for Al Jazeera that "counter-revolutionary forces are seeking to resurrect the military dictatorship model the Arab Spring dismantled." Kabalan contended that "regional and world powers have sponsored the return of military dictatorships to the region, with the hope that they would clean up the Arab Spring 'mess' and restore order." He also referred to Western powers' history of backing [military rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship "Military dictatorship") in the region, and how American interests in the Middle East clashed with French and British ones. He cited the U.S.-supported coups in Syria and Egypt, but generally how, as former U.S. Secretary of State [Condoleezza Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice "Condoleezza Rice") admitted, the United States "pursued stability at the expense of democracy... and achieved neither." Kabalan concluded:

> There seems to be a concerted effort to establish a crescent of military-ruled countries from Sudan in northeast Africa to Algeria in the northwest through Egypt and Libya to ward off popular upheaval and keep "Islamist" forces in check.[^406]

Analyst [H. A. Hellyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._A._Hellyer "H. A. Hellyer") attributes the persistence of [autocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy "Autocracy") and [dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship "Dictatorship"), as well as counter-revolution, to structures that go back to [colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism "Colonialism") - and also to the forms that states in the [MENA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA "MENA") region took in the postcolonial era and the social pacts established in the process. What we are seeing since 2011, Hellyer says, is a clash between those "inherited structures" and the new "demographic realities" of the populations in the region.[^407]

Compromise and dialogue with the entrenched regimes, followed by elections in [Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia "Tunisia") and Egypt, have produced either limited change or counter-revolution. In the first quarter of 2019, protests and mass mobilisation in Sudan and Algeria succeeded in toppling the heads of state, but, as scholar and [Woodrow Wilson Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson_Center "Woodrow Wilson Center") fellow [Marina Ottaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Ottaway "Marina Ottaway") states, there is a dilemma: The demands of the genuine grassroots movements are unlikely "to be attained through a peaceful process – one without violence and the violation of the human rights of many." Ottaway points to the experiences of Algeria and Egypt; in the former, the regime annulled the results of the elections in the early 1990s, and in the latter, the military carried out a bloody repression of the Muslim Brotherhood government after the Brotherhood's own short-lived presidency was removed from office:

> Attempts to bring about radical changes, by punishing and excluding a large part of the old elite, are not possible by democratic means, because such efforts elicit a strong reaction – a counterrevolution – leading to violence and repression.[^408]

Yemen's Economic Council – a state advisory body composed of cabinet members – said the militants looted the central bank in Hodeidah city and were delaying the fuel and food that arrive at the Hodeidah port. The looted funds were supposed to be used to pay salaries of public workers, who have not received payments for months, according to the report. This money will now "feed the militia's pointless war," the council said. On Wednesday, Yemen's Information Minister Muammar Al-Eryani said Houthis are looting and extorting the private healthcare sector.
