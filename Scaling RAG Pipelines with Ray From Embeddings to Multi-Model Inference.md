Scaling RAG Pipelines with Ray: From Embeddings to Multi-Model Inference

Suman Debnath - Technical Lead (ML) | Anyscale

Building RAG systems is straightforward, building them at scale is not. This session demonstrates how to construct production-ready RAG pipelines using Ray Data and Ray Actors, eliminating the common bottlenecks that plague distributed AI workloads. We'll walk through the complete RAG lifecycle: generating embeddings with stateful GPU actors, integrating with vector stores for retrieval, and orchestrating multi-model inference pipelines that intelligently route queries to different LLMs based on complexity. You'll see how Ray's unified compute model lets you seamlessly chain embedding models, vector databases, and chat models into a single streaming pipeline, while Ray handles the distributed scheduling, batching, and GPU memory management under the hood. Module 1: Foundations of Ray Data for AI Workloads Module 2: GPU-Accelerated Embedding Generation at Scale Module 3: Building the Complete RAG Pipeline Module 4: Multi-Model Routing & Production Patterns

1. Build distributed data pipelines with Ray Data
2. Scale embedding generation across GPUs
3. Integrate vector databases into streaming pipelines
4. Construct end-to-end RAG pipelines
5. Transition from batch to online inference

Helpful but Not Required.

- Prior experience with distributed computing frameworks (Spark, Dask)
- Familiarity with HuggingFace Transformers library
- Basic understanding of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture
- Experience with vector databases
