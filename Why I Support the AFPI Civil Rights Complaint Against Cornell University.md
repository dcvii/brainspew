I am a Cornell alumnus who examined whistleblower materials used by America First Policy Institute (AFPI) in their preparation of the [Civil Rights Complaint Against Cornell University](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americafirstpolicy.com%2Fissues%2Fafpi-files-federal-civil-rights-complaint-against-cornell-university-for-systemic-discrimination&data=05%7C02%7Ccneuss%40woodbridgepacific.com%7Cab221b6938c6482119b208ddd36f88e1%7C7355a2133b34437ca8da21e02f9a36d7%7C0%7C0%7C638899407544820364%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Yz81oQpuSJZTsBNbHricTU9LQkgu5nzzgYOM0gYZEuM%3D&reserved=0) submitted to federal government agencies on June 26, 2025. This complaint is based on internal documents leaked by Cornell faculty to AFPI and on AFPI’s review of related publicly available information. In addition, as reported in the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/cornell-university-discriminated-against-me-1e2d6a1e?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAj7CV5GY2Fc6S2Ju_EnbnAlmdK9WwShl01e-fx1zp8XEl6cvqJ6RLMg&gaa_ts=688a8b62&gaa_sig=QMWa6aMO1O-Hot28W-sJjEhJSwgiD8WbAlHmL9KJ6NLp3YoEaxmLUaqyEu0_ke5R0bOseaBZaUAckLdH7zFYpw%3D%3D) on July 30, 2025, AFPI assisted [Dr. Colin Wright in filing a complaint](https://www.realityslaststand.com/p/cornell-quietly-violated-my-civil) against Cornell with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) exposing blatant race-based discrimination in faculty hiring practices which violate US anti-discrimination laws.

I support the filing of these AFPI complaints because convincing evidence shows that:

∙ Cornell violated US Federal law to discriminate against potential faculty candidates by eliminating from consideration anyone with undesired identity traits.

∙ Cornell fails to comply with the spirit of the SFFA vs Harvard Supreme Court decision on college admissions.

∙ Cornell has used political litmus tests to reject faculty candidates for hire.

∙ Cornell makes financial awards and student scholarships based on unlawful and discriminatory criteria.

Evidence of individual instances of illegal practices does not establish that Cornell engaged in illegal activity on an institution-wide level. Nonetheless, the whistleblower reports along with publicly available evidence clearly indicates that high-level Cornell administrators planned and participated in illegal actions and may have directed such unlawful practices on a university-wide basis. Therefore, the AFPI complaints and associated evidence justifies a thorough US Government investigation to determine what is happening at Cornell and to determine whether Cornell should implement reforms to:

∙ Ensure compliance with the letter and spirit of all pertinent US law.

∙ Return academic excellence and merit-based decision making to their proper place as the chief determinant of who is chosen to study, teach and receive scholarships at Cornell.

∙ Return Cornell to a focus on its founding and curricular purposes and steer the university away from political dogma and activism.

Cornell’s administration reacted defensively and dismissively to the AFPI complaint, and to longstanding constructive criticism and corrective recommendations offered by concerned alumni and [Cornell Free Speech Alliance](https://www.cornellfreespeech.org/) (CFSA). Cornell’s administration’s response is carefully worded to avoid a clear denial of the accusations made in AFPI’s complaint. If widespread illegal practices are being employed at Cornell, the current administration would be directly implicated in the malfeasance. Given such culpability, I am concerned that Cornell’s current administration may be incapable of undertaking an honest and objective review of Cornell’s policies, practices and culture.

Given the seriousness of the AFPI complaint and the huge investment US taxpayers continue to make in Cornell, the US federal government seems to be the proper authority to investigate Cornell’s practices and, if necessary, compel the university to enact necessary corrective reforms. This would include terminating employment of those who implemented unlawful policies and/or resisted or prevented compliance with established US law.

Cornell’s promotion of discriminatory practices under the guise of “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion” programs is at the heart of the AFPI complaint. I agree with the concepts of “Diversity” and “Inclusion”, provided they are implemented in terms such that if you are a student or faculty applicant with the ability, preparation and drive to compete and succeed at Cornell, your application to join the Cornell Community is fully and fairly treated regardless of your race, ethnicity or any other personal trait.

Unfortunately, Cornell administrators appear to have diverged from this all-inclusive version of diversity and inclusion when “Equity” was added as the key component, calling for a biased redistributive approach to admissions, hiring and scholarships based on one’s race, ethnicity, sex and gender. The result was an aggressive and unlawful form of DEI at Cornell.

From May 2022 to today CFSA has regularly reported on Cornell’s obsession with [DEI discrimination](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cornellfreespeech.org%2Fnews%2Fcategories%2Fdei-discrimination&data=05%7C02%7Ccneuss%40woodbridgepacific.com%7Cab221b6938c6482119b208ddd36f88e1%7C7355a2133b34437ca8da21e02f9a36d7%7C0%7C0%7C638899407544875702%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=JM%2FxHHQ0L343fUwD4wb8%2B7qJSMjFt2OkxGMp2KdJsJc%3D&reserved=0). Cornell’s administration under President Kotlikoff issued statements claiming all acceptances and hiring are merit-based, yet it has not issued any statement formally eliminating the myriad DEI practices that existed as of September 2023.

**Evidence of Violating Federal Law in Faculty Hiring**

Cornell has a [library of policies](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolicy.cornell.edu%2Fpolicy-library&data=05%7C02%7Ccneuss%40woodbridgepacific.com%7Cab221b6938c6482119b208ddd36f88e1%7C7355a2133b34437ca8da21e02f9a36d7%7C0%7C0%7C638899407544896592%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=tvY4aZl6dkzWrRzn9XIEeirgXdOpv8SQe9%2BQQ9nxCgk%3D&reserved=0) governing university administration. [Policy number 6.6.1](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolicy.cornell.edu%2Fpolicy-library%2Ffilling-vacancies-excluding-bargaining-unit-staff&data=05%7C02%7Ccneuss%40woodbridgepacific.com%7Cab221b6938c6482119b208ddd36f88e1%7C7355a2133b34437ca8da21e02f9a36d7%7C0%7C0%7C638899407544912148%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=AwKjAX%2BP%2Fgy09hiDhZ8NFrQHmZnSdhIdzZ6sSNZb4h4%3D&reserved=0), concerns hiring. It requires Cornell to cast a wide net when searching for professors and staff, to ensure diversity in the hiring pool. This seems reasonable. AFPI’s complaint alleges that in hiring a new faculty member in latter 2022, Cornell administrators directed the hiring committee to do the opposite: NOT to advertise the position, to limit the applicant pool to only those people who possessed personal identity traits that qualified these individuals as potential “diversity hires”.

This evidence was produced by Cornell faculty reluctantly and belatedly. The whistleblowers were afraid of losing their jobs and careers – as well as suffering social ostracism, had they complained about or reported on the unlawful hiring process. This environment of fear is perhaps even worse than the unlawful hiring process. It indicates a pervasive culture of intimidation and thought policing on campus.

**Evidence of Cornell’s Failure to Comply with US Supreme Court Case on University Admissions: Students for Fair Admissions (“SFFA”) vs Harvard University**

Cornell has no publicly available policy on student admissions. Cornell published a report following the SFFA vs Harvard case, [Presidential Task Force on Undergraduate Admissions - Final Report](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cornell.edu%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dpresidential%2520task%2520force%2520on%2520undergraduate%2520admissions&data=05%7C02%7Ccneuss%40woodbridgepacific.com%7Cab221b6938c6482119b208ddd36f88e1%7C7355a2133b34437ca8da21e02f9a36d7%7C0%7C0%7C638899407544927303%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=IvcpoOVJvdnfzMW2J2ac7x3ljypbSTXg8irAiiAuS7Q%3D&reserved=0), outlining principles that appear to comply with the letter of that decision, but violate its spirit.

The report complies with the letter of the decision by avoiding any explicit mention of race, in favor of identifying “academically talented students from a broad range of backgrounds” and recruiting from non-traditional sources to achieve a diverse applicant pool. The report violates the spirit of the ruling by, for example, including an application question encouraging the applicant identify with a “community”, rather than as an individual:

A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.

The report encourages Cornell to recruit from “Community Based Organizations” to help generate a diverse applicant pool. Of the eleven such organizations suggested, six are heavily or solely oriented toward African American students, three to Black, Indigenous and People of Color (“BIPOC”) urban or low-income students, one to BIPOC first-generation college students, and only one to small town and rural first-generation college students including whites. The report de-emphasizes recruiting first-generation white students, implicitly messaging that white students do not enhance diversity no matter what their background.

I believe a rigorous Cornell recruiting and application process should include balanced recruitment based on geographic area or income, identity-neutral application questions, and objective merit-based standards for academic achievements of applicants. Such a process would be expected to yield acceptance statistics that correlate with rates of exceptional high school academic performance regardless of identity.

Cornell’s current recruiting and application process appears to be designed to obtain a biased admissions result. Applicant recruiting is designed to pump up the percentage of BIPOC applicants. At least one application question is designed to give BIPOC applicants a chance to emphasize their membership in an “oppressed” identity group as a means to gain admission. From 2002 to 2024, Cornell’s white student population became the most underrepresented of any of the [undergraduate student enrollment](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Firp.dpb.cornell.edu%2Funiversity-factbook%2Fstudent-enrollment&data=05%7C02%7Ccneuss%40woodbridgepacific.com%7Cab221b6938c6482119b208ddd36f88e1%7C7355a2133b34437ca8da21e02f9a36d7%7C0%7C0%7C638899407544941305%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=GRaJyRbX024uuaAsKMthX3BDpEYu258tlnZEdyNUXGA%3D&reserved=0) identity groups that Cornell tracks. Asian became the most over-represented, and Blacks plus Hispanics slightly underrepresented but less so than whites. It seems likely that Cornell treats Asian applicants reasonably under the SCOTUS SFFA decision but avoids recruiting Whites and then disproportionately rejects White applicants to make room for more Blacks and Hispanics than might be justified by their high school academic performance.

**Conclusion:**

The long-cherished motto of Cornell University, established in 1865 by our founder Ezra Cornell, is:

***“I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.”***

Cornell should fiercely uphold the “any person” part of this motto. That is, all qualified prospective students and faculty should have an equal opportunity and level playing field to compete for study and research positions at Cornell – regardless of the identity group affiliation of the persons admitted or hired. Hiring and admissions processes which discriminate based on identity group directly violate the “any person” foundations of the Cornell mission, and contribute to Cornell’s current [98% "politically pure" monoculture](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cornellsun.com%2Farticle%2F2020%2F10%2Fa-campus-tilted-blue-98-percent-of-employee-professor-donations-go-to-dems-and-left-leaning-pacs&data=05%7C02%7Ccneuss%40woodbridgepacific.com%7Cab221b6938c6482119b208ddd36f88e1%7C7355a2133b34437ca8da21e02f9a36d7%7C0%7C0%7C638899407544959660%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=C0%2F6ucE%2BQH%2FGFRt%2Bi%2F1%2FGqhZzeqWyNO6FKJ0X1BE26M%3D&reserved=0). As noted in the AFPI complaint, the use of DEI statement screens in faculty hiring wrongfully promotes this unhealthy monoculture. The result is that instead of freedom in “any study”, Cornell now pushes uniformity of thinking and ideological framing within all studies – not diversity.

Cornell should recognize the value of the equally important driver of campus diversity: the “any study” part of the Cornell creed. Historically, Cornell’s “any study” academic excellence has been driven by an astonishing range of academic interests, viewpoint perspectives, and intellectual capacity, drive and curiosity displayed by the student body and faculty. This “any study” ethic is being impaired by the ideological capture and DEI thought dogma now dominating the campus.

Cornell’s administration seems to be so committed the “Equity” component of DEI that it has become blind to the evidence that its hiring and admissions processes have become so biased that they violate US law and the “any person…any study” principles Cornell was founded upon. Cornell’s current DEI-driven administration, many of whom are simply paid employees with no deep or historical allegiance to Cornell, is seriously diminishing Cornell’s hard-earned reputation by supplanting the university’s tradition of merit-based academic excellence with transient DEI-centric political fads. The current university and administration monoculture seems unable to recognize or correct Cornell’s current perilous path to mediocrity.

Pressure to reform is now needed from people outside of Cornell’s administration. Ideally this pressure would come from Cornell’s Board of Trustees. Absent such pressure, I believe US federal government action is required.

This is why I support the AFPI complaint.
