**What are your plans for the future?  
**Yes. I am helping to put together “like-minded” people, coalitions, collaboratives in a cooperative, collective syndication in order to create an economic infrastructure that will meet and sustain the basic needs of the urban core population in the urban core geographical areas. This process will be filmed in a motion picture docu-drama called “In Search of Community Wealth Creators”. The end result of this process is to “Build Corporations of the Future” to alleviate structural systemic institutionalized racism.
