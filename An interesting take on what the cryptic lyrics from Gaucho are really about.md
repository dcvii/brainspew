I saw this post on quora and thought I might share it:

What do the lyrics of Steely Dan's "Gaucho" mean?

"What do the lyrics of Steely Dan's "Gaucho" mean?" It's noteworthy that Fagen went solo at Steely Dan's peak popularity. That's kinda like Amazon announcing that it's changing it's name to "Jeff Bezos" today… it makes no sense. It's also noteworthy that Becker has guest credits on Fagen's solo albums, not what one would expect if there was conflict leading to the breakup of the band. Keep those in mind as you read further…

Update 30-Nov-2020: Like everyone who cares about this tune, I'd puzzled on this song for many years (decades!). This interpretation started after watching Aja, the video about the album. One thing that struck me was that Walter Becker was kinda… awkward. So I began some web research.

Now brace yourself for an indisputable revelation…

The gaucho is (was) Walter Becker (R.I.P.)

Gaucho, the album, is Fagen's dedication to Becker and was the last Steely Dan album before the Donald went solo. Gaucho, the song, is Donald's veiled retelling of the break-up of Steely Dan. It demonstrates Fagen's empathy for his long-time friend and co-writer, but that the new label is hiring Don without Walter.

After a legal battle, Steely Dan owed one last album to ABC/MCA, their current label, and Donald is negotiating for their next deal. He's frustrated because Walter is falling apart and wrecking the negotiations. Quoting the first reference link above: “It was also during this time when Walter Becker went through a real rough patch in his personal life. The nasty narcotics habit he picked up on the West Coast was affecting his work, and in January 1980, his girlfriend was found dead in their apartment from a drug overdose, prompting a lawsuit slapped on Becker from her family. Just a few months after the overdose, Becker suffered serious injuries when a cab struck him as he was crossing a street in NYC. It took six months to recover…”

The lyrics indicate that Becker has been bringing an undesirable to label events, drawing unwelcome attention and causing Fagen embarrassment while mixing the WB brass.

"Custerdome" is a reference to Warner Brothers, the powerhouse label with whom Fagen is working to get signed. But Warner execs are telling Fagen, despite his protests, that Becker is not part of the deal. There's a lot of speculation that Gaucho references homosexuality.

Update 2/10/2021: It just now occurred to me to run a search on "the man from rio" (doh!) and all of the results refer to a 1964 film (L'Homme de Rio), the 5th highest earning film of the year in France. Being the Dan Fan that I am, I had to watch it. "The man from Rio" is Professor Catalan who plays the victim but turns out to be the film's evil antagonist. The lyric is a clever way of saying, "Look at you holding hands with the man (you think is your friend but secretly plots only to get what he wants even if it means destroying you)". This is just the type of obscure reference that we love from Steely Dan and, for me, shuts the door on any homosexual inuendo. Brazil also provides the setting for Gauchos and panchos.

When the lyrics are set to dialog (knowing Fagen's many lyric references to cinema), it's a simple screenplay vignette:

Fagen to Becker (2nd person) about the undesirable that Becker is bringing to label events (3rd person):

Just when I say "Boy we can't miss!" (we're going to get signed to a new label) You are golden then you do this

You say this guy is so cool (Becker's guest)

Snapping his fingers like a fool

One more expensive kiss-off, Who do you think I am?

Lord I know you're a special friend

But you don't seem to understand

We got heavy rollers (Warner Bros.)

I think you should know

Try again tomorrow

Can't you see they're laughing at me?

Get rid of him, I don't care what you do at home

Warner Bros. to Fagen (about Becker):

Would you care to explain \[note the change in vocals\]:

Who is the gaucho amigo?

Why is he standing in your spangled leather poncho

And your elevator shoes? (why are you giving Becker equal status to yourself?)

Bodacious cowboys such as your friend

Will never be welcome here high in the Custerdome

Fagen to Becker:

What I tell you back down the line?

I'll scratch your back you can scratch mine

No he can't sleep on the floor! What do you think I'm yelling for?

I'll drop him near the freeway. Doesn't he have a home?

Lord I know you're a special friend

But you refuse to understand

You're a nasty schoolboy with no place to go

Try again tomorrow

Don't tell me he'll wait in the car!

Look at you holding hands with the man from Rio

Warner Bros. to Fagen (about Becker):

Would you care to explain

Who is the gaucho amigo?

Why is he standing in your spangled leather poncho

With the studs that match your eyes?

Bodacious cowboys such as your friend

Will never be welcome here high in the Custerdome

> The main problem with this interpretation is that it presupposes that Donald Fagen wrote it by himself. He didn't. Walter said for years how proud he was of this song, and how he thought it was one of the songs he and DF wrote that came closest to fulfilling its potential. The lyrics sheet, which I have seen, is in Walter's handwriting, as is nearly every SD song I've seen.

> > Your interpretation is mistaken if just for the fact that the narrator clearly says, "I don't care what you do at home", implying that he's not gay since he doesn't care about / care for gay sex.
> > 
> > Instead, the narrator is a manager of some closeted celebrity who shows up to an event with a random gay hookup. The manager gets infuriated and demands that his client get rid of the dude to prevent a career-ending scandal (which is what would've happened in those days). It's one of the least cryptic Steely Dan songs, really.
> > 
> > Edit: Also, if anyone's wondering what "Bodacious cowboys, such as your friend, will never be welcome here, high in the Custerdome" means, the manager's just saying that openly gay men will never be allowed to hang among the A-List celebrity crowd or welcomed by corporate suits. The "Custerdome" itself was described by Becker and Fagen as being a fictional "archetype of a building that houses great corporations", but they're just metaphorically describing the corporate Hollywood system of the time and how it discriminated against homosexuals and coerced them to stay closeted.

> Gaucho is a species of people who live in the extreme south of Brazil and also in Uruguay and part of Argentina. Erroneously, it also became gentilic for people born in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Due to the fact that gaucho men proclaim themselves as being very macho, in the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and others, they began to mock gauchos as being effeminate, gay, homosexual, pederast... therefore, the term gaucho in Brazil can be used perjoratively to mock someone in a homosexual sense.

> > Gaucho refere-se à figura histórica dos vaqueiros e seus descendentes, que viviam nas planícies do sul da América do Sul, incluindo o Rio Grande do Sul que, até meados do século XVIII fazia parte da Argentina. E há um comentário errôneo; os gauchos nunca se "proclamaram" machos. Isso surgiu de um caracteristica cientificamente comprovada que o tipo de vestimenta do gaucho melhorava a fertilidade dos homens e isso associa-se à condição de "mais hhomem", ou "macho". Já a questão da zombaria tem fundo cultural, principalmente no RJ, que é dificil de explicar aqui devido ao espaço. Precisando, me chama; sou antropólogo e estudioso dos povos. Abraço!

> I’ve seen this interpretation but I don’t really buy it, although it’s tempting. I don’t think fagen would have so blatantly written about Walter in this way and that this is a lot of conjecture. I think it’s just a conversation between the narrator and someone he is in business with but that is also a secret lover. It almost comes off as an agent client relationship. It’s very strange, sad, funny, and sincere all at once.

> The downside to the obscure references, insider jokes and subversive winks that Donald & Walter put in many (OK, most) of SD’s songs is that people sometimes go too far with wildly elaborate analyses, go down rabbit holes of incredibly arcane theories for songs that are maybe snide/sarcastic/clever, but not so bizarrely complex. Gaucho always seemed like them archly joking that some friend or associate was like a 3rd wheel in the Dan, and that the resultant petty jealousy & friction around it was like a gay couple bitching with each other over some new guy showing up.. who knows, I’m probably wrong, but that’s how I heard it, as more of their ongoing theme of being as hard on themselves as they were on everyone else… joking about their own very human foibles…
