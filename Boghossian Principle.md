When referring to **Peter Boghossian**, the **“Boghossian Principle”** is an informal label, typically used in commentary or criticism, to describe his **critique of how institutions (especially academic and cultural) defend ideologically driven beliefs** under the guise of moral authority or epistemic protection.

---

### **The Boghossian Principle (as understood in context):**

  

> **“The more implausible an ideological belief is, the more aggressively it must be defended by institutions.”**

---

### **What This Means**

  

Peter Boghossian and his collaborators (notably James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose in the “Grievance Studies” affair) have argued that:

- Certain ideological beliefs (often rooted in postmodernism, critical theory, or identity politics) **are not rationally or empirically grounded**.
    
- However, these beliefs are **aggressively enforced and protected by institutions** (universities, media, HR departments, etc.).
    
- **The less defensible a belief is through reason or evidence, the more it must be protected through institutional pressure, social shaming, and ideological policing.**
    

  

This idea has been paraphrased or summarized by commentators as the **“Boghossian Principle.”**

---

### **Related Concepts**

- It echoes ideas from **Orwell** (“the more obviously false the belief, the more effort must be put into making people repeat it”).
    
- Closely tied to **conceptual policing**, **ideological capture**, and **moral orthodoxy enforcement** in institutions.
    

---

### **Example Applications:**

- If an academic institution endorses the claim that “mathematics is a tool of white supremacy,” the **Boghossian Principle** would predict that:
    
    - This belief, being highly controversial and weakly evidenced, would be **ferociously defended**.
        
    - Dissenters would be punished or silenced not because the idea is strong, but because it is **fragile and politically necessary** for ideological cohesion.
        
    

---

### **Summary**

  

> The **Boghossian Principle** (Peter’s version) critiques the way **ideologically fragile ideas gain institutional protection**, not because they are true, but **precisely because they are not**, and thus require enforcement through social or organizational pressure.

Are you aware of peter boghossian's principle about institutional defenses of the irrational?

Yes, I'm familiar with the concept referred to as the "Boghossian Principle," as articulated by Peter Boghossian. It appears in discussions on X and is described as follows:

The Boghossian Principle: "A system that forbids open conversation about its own existential problems is a system unworthy of preservation because it has already guaranteed its own failure."

This principle suggests that institutions or systems that suppress open dialogue about their fundamental flaws or irrational practices are inherently unsustainable. Boghossian, a philosopher known for his work on critical thinking and skepticism, argues that such suppression indicates a defense of irrationality, which undermines the institution's legitimacy and ability to self-correct.

A softer version of the principle, also mentioned on X, states: "**Any organisation that meets open conversation about its own problems with reproach is one unworthy of trust**." This emphasizes that mistrust is rational when institutions resist scrutiny.

While the principle itself is not extensively detailed in the provided web results, it aligns with Boghossian's broader critique of ideological conformity and lack of academic freedom, as seen in his resignation from Portland State University in 2021, where he cited an "illiberal orthodoxy" stifling dissent. His work, including the **Grievance Studies Affair**, exposed what he saw as irrational or ideologically driven academic practices, supporting his argument that institutions defending such practices without open debate are flawed.
