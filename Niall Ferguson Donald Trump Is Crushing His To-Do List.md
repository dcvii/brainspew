It always shocks me when people say they are shocked by Donald Trump. The president told us exactly what he was going to do. All you had to do [was look](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47).

By my count, there were 37 short but tightly scripted videos, recorded between December 2022 and December 2023, in which the then-candidate previewed just about every move he has made since his inauguration 100 days ago.

Because Kamala Harris had no policy ideas of her own, her campaign made almost no reference to these videos, which may be why so few people watched them.

But I did, because I thought Trump would win—and because I wanted to know what he would do. Here’s a representative sample:

One day, historians will refer to this as the most consequential to-do list in American history. And, in his first 100 days back in the White House, Donald Trump has crushed that list.

You are entitled to criticize President Trump—and [I do](https://www.thefp.com/p/niall-ferguson-trumps-tariffs-and), [regularly](https://www.thefp.com/p/niall-ferguson-donald-trump-wreck-global-financial-system). But you cannot accuse him of overpromising and underdelivering.

Since his second inauguration, the president has issued [no fewer than 211](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/tracking-trump-executive-orders-actions-dg/index.html) executive actions (including executive orders, proclamations, and memoranda). Around a quarter of these addressed aspects of the federal government, including seven aimed at curtailing diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The rest have been concerned with the economy, energy, immigration, national security, education, foreign policy, and health. Almost all of these actions were prefigured on Trump’s [campaign website](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47).

Not since the first year of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s first term in 1933 has an administration engaged in such frenetic activity. If he keeps it up for the rest of the year, Trump may even beat FDR’s record-breaking [average of 307 executive orders a year](https://www.governing.com/now/the-executive-order-a-history-of-its-rise-and-slow-decline.html).

There, however, the resemblance ends. For, if FDR’s goal was to enlarge the federal government, Trump’s New Deal is designed to shrink it.

The question, as we look beyond the first 100 days, is how far can a chronically understaffed administration with wafer-thin majorities in Congress achieve such a counterrevolution in government while at the same time pursuing a parallel counterrevolution in U.S. trade policy? The economic consequences of Trump’s attempt to turn back the tariff clock by roughly a century are already manifesting themselves.

Trump is crushing his to-do list. The question for the rest of us is whether or not he will crush the economy, too.

The way to assess the performance of something as complex as a new administration is to look not only at its stated intentions but also at its execution. Personnel, policy, and process are the essential ingredients.

#### **Personnel**

One distinctive feature of the Trump administration is that a combination of inertia and design have made this the most understaffed government in modern American history.

So far, the administration [has nominated 279 individuals](https://ourpublicservice.org/performance-measures/political-appointee-tracker/) to fill the roughly 1,300 posts that require Senate confirmation. Of these, just 53 [have been confirmed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2025/trump-appointee-tracker/) by the Senate. At the same time, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has spent a hundred days firing thousands of federal employees, in a purge unlike anything the Beltway has seen in a generation. Anyone who visits the corridors of power these days finds them eerily empty. The Eisenhower Executive Office Building is a ghost town. The National Security Council is a shell.

This unstaffed administration is able both to move fast and to break things—though not quite in the way the president’s red-pilled Silicon Valley allies envisaged. They were shooting for creative destruction; but there is such a thing as destructive destruction.

The hope that White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles would impose some kind of discipline on who has access to the president has been disappointed. The worst damage has been caused by Peter Navarro’s encouragement of the president to live out his “Tariff Man” fantasies. This has necessitated a good deal of firefighting by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. The battle over trade policy has also caused a rift between Bessent and Musk, whose unintended role as a lightning rod for anti-administration sentiment is shortening his time at the head of DOGE, not least by driving down the Tesla stock price. Trump is not the first president to sideline his secretary of state. If anything, Marco Rubio is faring somewhat better than, say, William Rogers did under Richard Nixon. The real problem is that the National Security Adviser, Mike Waltz, is not playing the Henry Kissinger role, but has been sidelined in favor of Steve Witkoff, whose hapless attempts to broker a Ukraine ceasefire with President Vladimir Putin recall the negotiations between First Little Piggy and the Big Bad Wolf.

Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are mired in twin crises—one over their ability to communicate securely, the other over their ability to manage their own agencies. Waltz’s National Security Council [is reeling](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/national-security-council-fiasco/682595/) from a series of presidential firings, several of them recommended by Laura Loomer, the far-right conspiracy theorist whom Wiles was apparently unable to keep out of the Oval Office. Hegseth, meanwhile, stands accused of having [plunged the Pentagon](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/hegseth-chaos-pentagon.html) into “disarray.”

#### **Policy and Process**

Disarray, at least, shows signs of life. Trump’s legislative agenda risks being DOA.

Almost none of the president’s agenda is going through Congress, including stuff such as tariffs that the Constitution assigns to the legislature (Article I, Section 8, [look it up](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/)). With slim majorities in both chambers, Republicans are betting on “one big beautiful \[tax\] bill” that will extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts; add some new tax cuts; increase the debt limit; boost spending on border security and defense—while also cutting some discretionary spending. Good luck to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson. If they can pass such a catchall bill this year, it will be the first miracle in history to occur on Capitol Hill.

While the House and Senate are roughly aligned on tax cuts, they are far apart on spending cuts, with the fiscal hawks in the lower chamber shooting for $1.5 trillion in reduced outlays, compared with the paltry $4 billion envisioned by GOP senators. Fights are looming over Medicaid cuts, the tax breaks in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, the state and local tax deduction, and the top marginal tax rate.

The bottom line: It is very unlikely that the Trump administration will achieve much in the way of deficit reduction this year. During the campaign, Trump vowed that DOGE would find savings of up to $2 trillion. That target had been halved by January 30. Now we are looking at just $150 billion of savings, of which just $63 billion are itemized. Turns out, the main driver of the federal deficit is not a wasteful bureaucracy but the ever-rising cost of Social Security and Medicare, two entitlement programs Trump has pledged to leave untouched. (Who knew?) Monthly federal outlays for February and March are higher than they were in the same period last year and in 2023.

On fiscal policy, to put it bluntly, the first hundred days have been a fail.

The same cannot be said on the key issue of illegal immigration. According to data from [Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters), “encounters” on the border in the first two months of Trump’s second term were down nearly 90 percent compared with the same period last year. That looks like an A+ for Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller, even if there are clearly going to be legal battles over such cases as that of [Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://www.thefp.com/p/is-donald-trump-breaking-the-law), who almost certainly should not have been deported to El Salvador. Still, you get the feeling Miller relishes such cases. The whole point is to signal to anyone contemplating a border crossing: Don’t risk it. Wherever you are now is better than the brutal [Salvadoran prison](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/world/americas/bukele-abrego-garcia-elsalvador-prison.html) where Abrego Garcia is being held.

A similar intent to intimidate lies behind the administration’s onslaught against the universities. It ought to be an unmitigated cause for celebration that the Trump administration is acting to curb the excesses of the “progressive” elements in our higher education system. On a wide range of issues—from the prevalence of antisemitism on campuses, to the various forms of discrimination dressed up as affirmative action and DEI, to the questionable role played by some accreditors—Trump is in the right.

The problem is that, in practice, research scientists appear to be paying the price of ideological excesses that mainly emanated from humanities departments and centers for “grievance studies.” I have somewhat limited sympathy for the STEM professors, who were conspicuously absent or silent when their colleagues from anthropology and gender studies were trashing academic freedom, harassing conservative scholars, and lowering academic standards. The scientists acquiesced in the overt politicization of their universities, never considering that there might one day be a price to pay. Yet the U.S. still benefits enormously from federal funding of scientific research. This is not the part of higher education where the cancer is located.

The other obvious danger is that, by seeking to dictate how Harvard University runs its affairs, the administration is not only overstepping the limits on its constitutional authority, but also ensuring that the worst elements within Harvard can portray themselves as heroic opponents of the detested Trump and thereby evade long-overdue internal reforms.

I have a similar ambivalence about the Trump administration’s foreign policy. Its predecessor was guilty of an infuriating succession of failures of deterrence. But how much of an improvement are we seeing?

The president now claims that he was only jesting with his campaign pledge to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. That’s good, because no one took it seriously. The key question remains how far he and his administration are willing to lean on the Russian government the way they have leaned on the Ukrainians. We saw the first signs of presidential impatience with Putin last week. But I remain to be convinced that a lasting ceasefire, much less a lasting peace, can be achieved without sustained economic and military pressure on Moscow. Trump should want Ukraine to be South Korea; he risks leaving it as South Vietnam.

In the Middle East, I am equally skeptical about the president’s apparent inclination to resuscitate the Iran nuclear deal that he killed in his first term. I still think the likely outcome in the coming months is an Israeli attack, with tacit U.S. support, on Iran’s nuclear sites. But the longer this is postponed, the less successful it will surely be. Every week that passes gives Tehran time to repair its air defenses, devastated by the Israeli Air Force six months ago.

Yet the biggest foreign-policy puzzle is whether Trump can succeed in reducing America’s reliance on China for critical imports, while simultaneously waging trade wars with America’s principal allies—and everyone else, too.

And that brings us to the most worrisome part of the first hundred days: The economic consequences of Trump’s tariffs.

#### **The Worst Thing So Far—By Far**

Trump told us that [the most beautiful word](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5355661/tariffs-history-meaning) in the English language was *tariff*. And he made no secret of his intention to use tariffs as a negotiating lever, as a kind of economic sanction, and as a source of revenue. What was impossible to foresee was how soon in his second term he would deploy tariffs, how aggressively, and how chaotically.

He opened by hitting Mexico, Canada, and then China with a succession of punitive levies. But Liberation Day—April 2—was when Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs on all the countries with which the United States trades, plus a few non-sovereign territories (including one island inhabited solely by penguins).

It took some time for analysts to work out what had happened. The president wanted reciprocal tariffs. Overstretched staffers ended up asking artificial intelligence to come up with something that fulfilled Trump’s criteria. The formula the large language models spat out originated in a paper by Peter Navarro, the only economist in the world who shares Trump’s view that all our bilateral goods trade deficits are a problem (as opposed to our aggregate current account deficit).  
  
The result was one of the great fiascos in the history of modern economic policy. Combined with the tariffs Trump imposed on China—which were so punitive as to amount to a trade embargo—Liberation Day triggered panic in financial markets.

For several days, the world teetered on the brink of a financial crisis as bonds and the dollar both sold off—a combination rarely seen, save in times of extreme market distress. At lunchtime on April 9, a 2008-level [crisis was averted](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-stock-market) when Trump postponed the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. Two days later, he exempted electronics from his tariffs, including those on China.

Even after these concessions, however, the United States remains a radically more protectionist country than it was prior to Trump’s second inauguration. The [Yale Budget Lab](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-april-15-2025) estimates that the overall average effective U.S. tariff rate is now 28 percent, the highest since 1901, and more than 10 times the 2024 rate. Consumer prices could rise by around 3 percent in the short run. Shoe prices could rise by 87 percent; clothes by 65 percent. These are just two of the [many sectors](https://www.thetimes.com/article/83a98037-c0d2-4363-8257-345216fdbfde) where the United States still relies heavily on imports from China, even if these often come via third countries to avoid the tariffs imposed in Trump’s first term.

This remains an extraordinary shock for an administration to inflict on its own citizens, to say nothing of the rest of the world. And, while we may have pulled back from a financial crisis, the probability of a recession has risen substantially. The bond market has settled down somewhat, but it remains out of whack relative to the dollar’s decline. This is the key problem, much more than the stock market correction (at the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 10 percent from its February 19 peak, compared with a nadir of 19 percent on April 8, the day before Trump delayed the reciprocal tariffs).

That said, a fall in stock prices matters. U.S. households hold close to a third of their total assets in equities. The wealthiest 10 percent of households own 87 percent of all stocks, and the top 10 percent of households by earnings now account for about half of total consumer spending. So even a stock market correction will impact consumption. Trade policy uncertainty has also made loans more expensive for businesses.

Think of what is unfolding as a chain reaction. The first place it shows up, after financial markets, is in business confidence. In April, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing business outlook survey sank to [its lowest point in two years](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/mbos-2025-04#:~:text=The%20diffusion%20index%20for%20current,64%20percent%20reported%20no%20change.). In the latest New York Fed manufacturing survey, firm sentiment [dropped by 20 points](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/Survey/Empire/empire2025/ESMS_2025_04.pdf), while the outlook for new orders dropped to the lowest point in the history of the survey (which goes back to 2001).

The next domino to fall is consumer sentiment, [which has plummeted](https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) over the past month.

Next comes the behavioral change. Foreign travel to the United States has [declined sharply](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/travelers-going-to-united-states-less-due-to-trump-tariffs-rhetoric-rcna201640). The Los Angeles port’s website currently shows large declines for future bookings compared to a year ago. True, U.S. consumers and households have not yet changed their behavior. But that is simply because the chain reaction has not got there yet. Give it a month or two—then you’ll see it clearly in the data.

The Federal Reserve knows this. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell—having been threatened with summary dismissal by Trump just a week ago—is in no hurry to cut interest rates. With consumer prices almost certain to rise because of the tariffs, he can argue that his obligation to achieve price stability precludes immediate rate cuts.

The end point of such an economic chain reaction tends to be political revulsion. But this may already have begun. According to polling from YouGov/*[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/04/16/donald-trumps-approval-rating-is-dropping)*, Trump’s approval rating has fallen by 14 points since he entered office in January. A *[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-poll-approval.html)*[/Siena](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-poll-approval.html) College poll found that 55 percent of voters, including 63 percent of independents, oppose his tariffs. His approval rating among independents is down to 29 percent. Now imagine how these numbers will look if the economy does enter a recession later in the year. And then picture what that will mean for next year’s midterm elections.

“Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.” That is the best of H.L. Mencken’s aphorisms in his *[A](https://amzn.to/4cV3uxN)* *[Little Book in C Major](https://amzn.to/4cV3uxN)* (1916). It seems highly apposite. Less well-known is another political aperçu in the same book: “The majority always has its way in the end. So does the undertaker. But neither gains in pleasantness by the fact.”

What does Trump do now? He may have only another hundred days to salvage his second term and avoid premature political interment. In his business career, when things went wrong, there was an easy way out: bankruptcy, something Trump ventures [entered six times](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/) between 1991 and 2009. But there is no equivalent of Chapter 11 in the realm of politics.

The nearest thing would be for Trump to execute a radical U-turn on tariffs, accompanied by a Night of the Long Knives designed to clear out the various figures in the administration best qualified to be fall guys. Yet my hunch is that tariffs are too central to Trump’s worldview for him to swallow such a declaration of policy bankruptcy. A more likely outcome is that the Wall Street Wise Guys, led by Secretary Bessent, hastily stitch together a bunch of back-of-envelope trade deals, continue to soothe the bond market, and rely on a weakening dollar to keep the U.S. economy out of recession. If they are lucky, by this time next year they will look like geniuses. If not—if inflation picks up, the deficit widens, the bond market takes fright, and Cold War II with China escalates, with a Taiwan Semiconductor Crisis playing the part of the 1973-74 Oil Price Shock—then Trump runs the risk of sharing Nixon’s ignominious fate. For, if Republicans lose the House, a third impeachment becomes a near inevitability.

That would be a tragic outcome for a man who made no secret of his radical intentions last year, and who—if only he had under- rather than over-delivered on tariffs—would be in a far stronger position than he finds himself on Day 101 of his second White House term.

The next hundred days will reveal if Trump’s epic to-do list was too much, too soon.
