WASHINGTON, D.C. — I met the First Lady of Nigeria at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C., during her short trip to the U.S. last week. “I’m here,” said Oluremi Tinubu, “to make some clarifications.” She’s aware of what she calls “the recent hype in the social media that there is Christian genocide,” and has come to America to “really tell who would like to listen the real situation on the ground.”

I have reported [on the atrocities](https://www.thefp.com/p/christians-slaughtered-in-nigeria) committed against Christian communities by Islamists in Nigeria. I’ve also spoken to Nigerians who are on the ground. I’ve reviewed photographs of butchered children and heard eyewitness testimonies that are not easily forgotten. So I was curious to know how her husband’s government views the violence.

In early October 2025, President Bola Tinubu told an audience in Imo State, which is majority Christian, that there is no religious persecution in his country. To say otherwise, he said, “is a lie from the pit of hell.” I asked his wife if that is still his position, and she replied: “To an extent.”

At the beginning of November, not long after President Tinubu made this statement, the Trump administration [designated Nigeria](https://abcnews.com/Politics/us-designates-nigeria-country-concern-after-trump-threat/story?id=127148133) “a country of particular concern”—a title reserved for nations that tolerate “systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom.” In response, President Tinubu [held the line](https://x.com/officialABAT/status/1984640117361840491?s=20), insisting on his official X account: “The characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality.”

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, released a [very different statement](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115476385101120405) on Truth Social:

> If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the USA will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, “guns-a-blazing,” to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.

The gap between the two presidents’ narratives hasn’t fully closed. But when it comes to action, the two administrations appear to be aligning. By the end of November, President Tinubu had declared a [nationwide security emergency](https://statehouse.gov.ng/president-tinubu-declares-a-security-emergency-orders-army-police-to-recruit-more-personnel/), ordered the army and police to recruit thousands of additional personnel, and [redeployed VIP guards](https://statehouse.gov.ng/president-tinubu-orders-the-withdrawal-of-police-officers-guarding-vips-for-core-police-duties/) to cover core policing duties. On Christmas Day, the Nigerian military launched a coordinated missile strike—working in conjunction with the U.S.—on Islamic State affiliates in the northwestern part of the country. In January, the [Nigerian government expanded](https://www.pr.com/press-release/958241) operations to flush out terrorists in forested areas and increase protection [around places of worship](https://statehouse.gov.ng/president-tinubu-declares-a-security-emergency-orders-army-police-to-recruit-more-personnel/). In the following weeks, the Nigerian military [killed a commander](https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-boko-haram-commander-dfe0cddb338642045920e1e0371ab568) of the infamous Islamist group Boko Haram, plus 10 members of the group, and nine were charged in relation to the [Yelwata massacre](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-charges-nine-with-2025-massacre-that-killed-150-2026-02-02/), during which at least 150 Christians, many of whom had already been displaced by persecution, were shot, hacked to death, and [set ablaze](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/26/nx-s1-5471472/we-are-being-driven-from-the-land-after-a-massacre-a-nigerian-village-buries-its-dead) in temporary shelters. (I [wrote about](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/nigeria-christians-trump.html) the atrocity in June 2025, in a piece that, according to *The* *New York Times*, “resonated” with lawmakers in D.C.) And, on the day I met the First Lady, news had just broken that the militaries of Nigeria and the U.S. had “ [increased collaboration](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/us-announces-military-team-nigeria-after-recent-attacks-129827132).”

On February 3, General Dagvin Anderson, head of U.S. military operations in Africa—who met President Tinubu in Rome late last year—announced that there is now a small team of Americans [based in Nigeria](https://www.state.gov/digital-press-briefing-with-general-dagvin-r-m-anderson-commander-u-s-africa-command-and-sergeant-major-garric-m-banfield-command-senior-enlisted-leader-u-s-africa-command-on-africom-priorities) “that brings some unique capabilities from the United States.” And this past Tuesday, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that the U.S. was sending an [additional 200 troops](https://www.wsj.com/world/africa/u-s-to-send-200-troops-to-help-nigeria-fight-islamist-insurgents-7f59ee03?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqedHuXtC4p6k-Bzb5sjYQ1jwRbgUJDn9wvFifpH61-PGSSZWpvrFLldT4I7zHg%3D&gaa_ts=698cbd8d&gaa_sig=50DJozC2osE7F3ugZbk1_ncRNWdY26NmZHsp_nJnpg5j_6vSasafvOhnn6kpOh7muUvd2Ejzyrp4r7MbgP92qQ%3D%3D) to Nigeria.

In D.C., the First Lady—wearing a green floral dress and headscarf, round brown glasses, matching pearl earrings and necklace, and a jewel-encrusted shawl—was chaperoned by several representatives from the Washington lobbying firm DCI, which the Nigerian government has reportedly [paid $9 million](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/11/2026/nigeria-steps-up-us-lobbying-push?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to help communicate its security strategy to U.S. policymakers and media. When I asked her about Nigeria’s work with the Trump administration, she said: “We’ve been talking.”

“I understand President Trump’s concern, and we quite appreciate that,” she went on, before explaining President Tinubu’s concerns.

“Investors are coming into Nigeria a lot, and we need security to secure their investment,” she said. The Trump administration, she said, will “help us with weapons and equipment.”

“If they give us security, maybe we can engage in bilateral trade talks.”

Both presidents want peace, but do they agree on the nature of the conflict? To hear the First Lady tell it, many Americans’ understanding of what is happening in Nigeria is an oversimplified tale of religious conflict. Tinubu’s position is that the violence is somewhat random, the targets indiscriminate.

“We have cases of terrorism,” she said. “We have cases of kidnapping for ransom. We have banditry. We have ritual killers, and these are things you have to study intricately.”

To hear the First Lady tell it, many Americans’ understanding of what is happening in Nigeria is an oversimplified tale of religious conflict.

But when I spoke to sources with firsthand experience of this terrorism, kidnapping, and banditry, they told me the First Lady and her husband are misleading the public in their reluctance to admit that the violence endemic in parts of their country is disproportionately affecting Christians.

“I have been living in the north, where I have seen the systemic persecution of Christians,” said Father Simon Galmi—whose name we’ve changed for his safety—a priest in the Diocese of Minna in Niger State. He told me he has worked to help dozens of individuals affected by Islamist violence. “Before the threats from the U.S. came, no one actually cared,” he said. (I found Father Galmi through a Nigerian friend of my parents’. He receives no foreign aid, and I am the first journalist he has ever spoken to.)

On-the-ground testimony is all the more important given that many Western journalists simply accept the Nigerian state’s narrative. After the atrocities in Yelwata, [the BBC reported:](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyznnl4mddo) “The authorities have not blamed any group, but it is safe to assume that there are lots of victims on both sides, as any attack usually leads to revenge and then a cycle of violence.” More recently, *[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/nigeria-christians-trump.html)* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/nigeria-christians-trump.html) that the Nigerian government had prioritized “making concessions to Mr. Trump” over “correcting the record on who bears the brunt of the violence.” The implication was that “Christian activists, Republican lawmakers, and American celebrities” have misled the public with the idea that this violence is religiously motivated.

But now that our military is involved in this conflict, the U.S. urgently needs to understand: Is there a difference between what’s really happening in Nigeria, and what the Nigerian government says is happening?

If the Nigerian administration’s aim was to persuade America that it is serious about protecting its Christians, Oluremi Tinubu was in many ways the perfect envoy. Not only is she a Christian, she was also ordained a pastor in 2018. Her husband, the president, is a Muslim. They have been married 38 years, making them living proof that the two faiths can live peacefully together.

The First Lady told me her sister introduced them. “I always tease my husband. We didn’t actually have a long courtship,” she said. “I just saw somebody who is a very brilliant person. And I thought, *He’s good. He’s very ambitious*. So I believed he would go places, and I was ready to marry, so I just jumped right into it.”

At first, her father was skeptical. “He asked him: ‘You’re a Muslim? I hope you won’t convert her to become one.’ ” The couple made some compromises: Their children were raised Christian but have Muslim names, to honor their father. He goes to church with her, and she attends mosque with him. “I pray with him. And he prays over me,” she said. “As a Christian, he is the head of my home.”

Nigeria is one of the only nations in the world that has a population that is roughly 50/50 Christian and Muslim (although [reports suggest](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2026/02/12/religious-diversity-around-the-world/#ten-countries-where-the-population-is-most-evenly-split-between-two-religious-groups) that in recent years, the latter population has grown to represent up to 56 percent of Nigerians). Though Islamist violence is nothing new in Nigeria, it isn’t inevitable either. When the country gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1960, the north of the country was (and remains) majority Muslim while the south has long been majority Christian, but throughout Nigeria, many Christians and Muslims lived peacefully side by side.

Tensions gradually erupted, including the 1980 uprising in the far-northern state of Kano, in which a predominantly Islamist mob killed thousands, and subsequent riots in religiously mixed cities such as Kaduna. Violence intensified after 1999, when several Muslim-majority northern states adopted sharia law, and escalated further after 2009 with the rise of Boko Haram and other jihadist groups. The targets tend to be Christian and, to a lesser extent, non-Islamist Muslim communities across Nigeria who refuse to convert to their extreme ideology. Most Nigerian Muslims remain politically moderate, especially in Lagos, the cosmopolitan former capital. (Generally speaking, the south—where both Tinubu and her husband were born—is more integrated.)

Since the beginning of the 21st century, major candidates for Nigeria’s presidency have signaled that they will represent the interests of both religious groups by offering voters a mixed ballot: For the past 25 years, Christian candidates have always run alongside Muslim running mates, and vice versa. But President Tinubu broke this norm in 2023 by choosing a fellow Muslim, Kashim Shettima, as his vice president.

His wife told me she saw this as a way for Nigeria to move past an era in which politicians are defined by their religion. “When my husband was campaigning, before he won, I said: ‘You know, we have to rewrite the story. There will be a time in Nigeria that there will be a Christian-Christian ticket. I look forward to that. And if we believe that we are not going to change our ideologies, we cannot grow.’ ”

But she also hinted that part of the decision came down to strategy, rather than dreams of a better future. “Let’s face it, the Muslims are more than us,” the First Lady told me. “If a southerner wants to run for president, politics is a game of numbers,” she said. “You have to pick another Muslim. You can’t pick a Christian.”

Tinubu spoke frankly about how a politician’s religion may affect their chances of getting elected, but she also rejected the idea that religious beliefs might shape what actually happens in the presidential villa.

“I’m a Christian in the presidential villa. I take care of the interests of Christians, and I also take care of Muslims,” she said. “That is what life should be. We have to respect everybody, irrespective of religion.”

Few of Nigeria’s American allies would argue with that sentiment. But the truth is, there are many parts of Nigeria where people are not respected because of religion.

When I met the First Lady, she was accompanied by a special adviser to the National Security Agency for the Nigerian government, who told me that between February 2024 and November 2025 there had not been any mass abductions of schoolchildren in Nigeria.

But there have been plenty of abductions from churches. I’ve seen records from the Diocese of Minna, which documents the abduction of 52 people on December 4, 2024, from St. Joseph Church, and the kidnapping of 63 people on February 8, 2025, from St. Andrew’s Church, as well as 19 other smaller-scale kidnappings and killings throughout the diocese in that time period.

Reliable reporting is always a challenge in remote and terror-torn places, and even the Nigerian authorities don’t always reliably record attacks. Last month, more than 170 Christians were abducted in Kaduna State. Initially the state police denied this had happened, before later confirming [that it did](https://www.trtafrika.com/article/2299bafcc6e3?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

There are international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that try to document the violence. The Observatory for Religious Freedom in Africa (ORFA) [reports that](https://orfa.africa/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/26082024-ORFA-4-YEARS-REPORT.pdf) in Nigeria, between 2019 and 2023, 16,769 Christians and 6,235 Muslims were killed by Islamist extremists. In the same period, 11,185 Christians and 7,899 Muslims were abducted. The atrocities don’t appear to have slowed down since that interval. According to Open Doors, an American nonprofit that monitors Christian persecution across the world, [3,490 Christians](https://www.foxnews.com/world/nigeria-named-epicenter-global-killings-christians-over-faith-2025-report-says) were killed and 2,293 abducted in Nigeria from October 2024 to September 2025. The true figures are likely much higher, said CEO Ryan Brown, explaining that they record only those where they are able to verify that the motivation for the violence was religious.

Survivor accounts consistently point to religious motivation—brutal slaughter of Christian communities at worship and on holy days, shouts of “Allahu akbar *”* while attacks are taking place, and forced conversions to Islam. In the north, underage Christian girls [have been abducted](https://www.csi-int.org/news/nigeria-underage-christian-girls-forcibly-married-converted-to-islam/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), forced to convert to Islam, and married off to older men.

There are those who argue that, because both Christians and Muslims are targeted, it’s unfair to suggest that the former group is in more danger. But Sean Nelson of Alliance Defending Freedom International, an Austria-based legal group, says this is misguided.

“No one denies that Muslims, particularly moderate Muslims who reject extremism, are often targeted as well—just look at this week’s atrocious attack in Kwara State,” said Nelson, referring to the [February 3 slaughter](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dkd3llw1lo) of 75 villagers in western Nigeria by Islamists—“in the name of religion,” according to one local.

“But with Christians being a minority in the north, they are disproportionately targeted, being [more than five times](https://canopyforum.org/2024/09/11/violence-in-nigeria-discussion-of-the-statistical-evidence-for-the-disproportionate-targeting-of-christians/) as likely to be killed than Muslims,” Nelson went on.

“Some people dislike the notion of saying Christians are specifically persecuted because they think it will feed a Muslim versus Christian narrative that they believe will exacerbate the problem or lead to widespread retaliatory cycles,” said Nelson. “Or that this is all Islamophobia.”

“But I think that ignoring the truth has allowed the violence to fester, particularly against Christians in the Middle Belt,” he said.

The Observatory for Religious Freedom in Africa reports that in Nigeria, between 2019 and 2023, 16,769 Christians and 6,235 Muslims were killed by Islamist extremists.

Father Galmi, the priest from the Minna Diocese, told me that “in the north, Christians are second-class citizens.” In the 12 states where sharia law has been implemented, he explained, there are things he “cannot do as a Christian,” such as buy land to build a church, or foster Muslim children with nowhere else to go.

He also explained how sharia law creates a culture of impunity for those who commit atrocities in the name of Islam. He gives the example of Deborah Yakubu, a 25-year-old Christian student from Sokoto State in the north, who, in 2022, was [beaten to death](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/female-student-nigeria-beaten-to-death-sokoto) by a mob for allegedly blaspheming against the prophet Muhammad. [Years later](https://persecution.org/2024/05/14/calls-for-justice-renewed-on-second-anniversary-of-christian-students-death/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), he said, “nobody has been brought to book.”

Galmi said he has seen many of these atrocities firsthand. He told me he has personally paid for vigilantes to rescue girls who have been abducted and forced into marriage by jihadis, after the police did nothing; he has paid the hospital bills of women and children who had been sexually abused and beaten by their abductors; he has been told by state police that his life is at risk from Islamists, because he works with victims of the violence they perpetuate—with women who have been raped, parents whose children have been murdered, torture victims, and parishioners whose churches have been burned to the ground. Because of the danger to his own life, he moves from place to place, but has found that religious persecution exists where Christians are in the minority.

Father Galmi recalls a child he was helping who had witnessed his father’s hands being cut off. “This boy is struggling with coming to terms with the fact that his father has no hands because he’s a Christian, and he watched his father suffer that brutal attack by this Islamic terrorist,” he told me. To speak to him, it’s clear how soul-crushing it is to witness the suffering of the victims he works with. “They are not just traumatized,” said Father Galmi. “They are broken forever.”

I asked the First Lady if she had visited any sites of Islamist atrocities to speak with survivors, and she told me she had traveled widely across Nigeria, including to Plateau State, where Christians [have been displaced](https://persecution.org/2025/04/16/54-christians-killed-following-palm-sunday-service/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and massacred by Islamist Fulani militants.

There, she said, she spoke to the elders of the community, who showed up in the hundreds, she said, and gave them over $1 million to rebuild their homes.

“I told them: ‘This will be the last time.... Why are you killing each other? I can’t be bringing money here, and then you’re squandering it,” she said.

[

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GnxN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb37b7234-7407-4d95-af14-7a6fc808bd53_1320x30.png)

The First Lady is, on the face of it, an advocate for women’s rights.

Having been a politician in her own right—in 2011, she was elected to be a senator representing Lagos Central, a position she held until 2023—she told me women need to be better represented in politics. That is why, she said, [she is supporting](https://guardian.ng/news/first-lady-backs-reserved-seats-for-womens-bill-advocacy-lead-hails-move/) the Reserved Seats for Women Bill, which would increase the number of women in Nigeria’s federal and state legislatures. (Currently, [out of 107 senators](https://data.ipu.org/parliament/NG/NG-UC01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), only four are women.)

As First Lady, she has encouraged women to [start businesses](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/08/tinubu-committed-to-women-development-first-lady/). She has [spoken out against](https://www.unicef.org/nigeria/press-releases/first-lady-nigeria-pledges-her-support-ending-fgm-unfpa-unicef-annual-consultation) female genital mutilation. And after she was [ordained a pastor](https://guardian.ng/news/redeem-ordains-tinubu-as-pastor/) at the Redeemed Christian Church of God in 2018, she started the “Daughters of Zelophehad” ministry, which supports young women in becoming leaders. She also has a podcast by the same name that explores biblical themes of female empowerment.

So I was curious to know how she felt about the fact that teenage girls are being abducted and forced to marry in parts of Nigeria where sharia law has been implemented.

“That’s a cultural thing,” she said. “It doesn’t have to do anything with law.”

The Islamists, she explained, believe “that girls are not supposed to be educated, and that’s why, when you have Christian communities in their midst... they become a target for all those radical Muslims and the terrorist groups.”

“We have to respect everybody, irrespective of religion,” Tinubu said. (Jason Andrew for *The Free Press*)

She points to the 2014 abduction of 276 girls at a school in Chibok, in northeastern Nigeria, by Boko Haram. (Michelle Obama, then First Lady of the United States, drew attention to their plight with a hashtag, #BringBackOurGirls.) “Immediately they clothed them with hijab. They took a picture of them. It’s like: ‘We’re going to marry you off,’ ” she said. “They didn’t kill them, and they didn’t ask for ransom. This is to instill fear into them... to not want to go to school.”

Tinubu, however, insists on optimism. “You know, Nigerians are quite resilient. All these communities are still springing up. They believe in the faith. And we as a government, what we are supposed to do is to give them protection, and that is what this administration is trying to do.”

Tinubu says that the president “is working day and night to secure lives.” And “they’ve done a lot.”

But, she suggested, it’s not as simple as #BringBackOurGirls. “Even those girls kidnapped during Chibok, they are still trying to rescue them,” Tinubu said, “until they learned recently that most of them fell in love with their abductors, so that’s quite difficult. You know, they refuse to come back.”

Father Galmi was shocked when I asked him about this claim. “Most of those girls, they are never, never in love with their abductors,” he said. “In most instances, their families are threatened.”

He’s spoken to mothers and fathers who long to extricate their daughters from marriages they never agreed to. “They are told: ‘We will kill you if you try to take them away,’ ” he said.

“The government should stand for them. The government should protect them,” said Father Galmi. “Nigeria is a secular state, so we should not be living under any Islamic law.” Nigerian federal law does not allow marriage under 18 without parental consent. If that restriction is not going to be enforced, Father Galmi said, “why do we then have that Nigerian law? Why do we have a Ministry of Gender Equality and Women Affairs?”

“This is hypocrisy at its highest,” he said.

If Trump actually wants to help Nigeria’s Christians, Father Galmi says, he should “go beyond the government narrative and speak with the people. Send representatives who will speak with the people that are affected directly. Then you get a clear picture of what is happening.”

I asked Father Galmi what he makes of recent signs that his government has begun to take terrorism seriously. He sees it as nothing more than virtue-signaling. The Nigerian government is only “being friendly” to President Trump, he says, “to ensure that he does not pay much attention any longer.”

President Tinubu has plenty of domestic issues to focus on before the next presidential election, in 2027. From the outset, his presidency was defined by radical economic interventions: removing fuel subsidies and [floating the currency](https://www.barrons.com/news/nigeria-unifies-currency-exchange-rates-floats-naira-72c0ecd2?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdAOdc2bk3BkcxdNltfAboa6Xbeg7kdb3J2sFXXAncRSL4jcIj0IMlQ&gaa_sig=1qi7SR566FmGUtlj5PggBCMXXePKzkzN87p912H5aq3s7EGZy6ptV72zE3nxVZ0f9Ngs8sMRlbbpyaPjbImDWg%3D%3D&gaa_ts=6989424d), which initially caused inflation and [worsened living conditions](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/10/24/hope-or-hardship-nigeria-tinubus-economic-reforms-and-their-fallout) for many Nigerians. But his strategy seems to have paid off, with the currency relatively stable against the U.S. dollar and economic growth projected at around 4.5 percent. “We went through a very dark tunnel. Food prices were up. Exchange rates were up. We went through a lot,” said his wife.

“And now, when the world is saying, ‘Oh, Christian genocide...  ” she said, trailing off before continuing: “They’ve tried a lot, you know, to bring this government down.”

“But now we are out of the tunnel,” she went on. “Nigeria is growing steadily. A lot of reforms are being made.”

I was curious about how the First Lady feels about being a high-profile Christian in a country where people who share her faith are regularly attacked. In 2024, [an extremist imam](https://www.christiandaily.com/news/muslim-cleric-threatens-nigeria-first-lady-for-serving-as-pastor) called her an “infidel” and called for her to be killed. Does she worry for her safety? And does that make her more sympathetic to the fear that many Christians in her country live in?

“I laughed it off,” she said. “I have security.”

“I’m 65 years old,” she went on. “Why would anybody threaten me?”

Tinubu was in London when she heard about the threat, which she said came from a place of ignorance. Later, she said, when she visited the state the imam was from, “for a minute, I was a little bit scared.”But those fears were short-lived. “A lot of Muslim clerics—notable ones—spoke against it. And he later apologized.”

“My life is not in someone’s hands,” she said. “When my time comes, I will believe that’s God’s time. So I didn’t pay attention.”
