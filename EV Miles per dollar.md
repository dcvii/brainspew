Read this article and provide a table that gives me an accurate caluclation of EV miles per dollar vs ICE miles per dollar. https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a45036169/electric-vehicle-ev-cost-to-charge/?link\_source=ta\_first\_comment&taid=68fe6fcb4137f700011cd8a9

Based on the data provided in the article, here is a table that calculates the EV miles per dollar versus ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) miles per dollar for the different scenarios presented.

The "Miles per Dollar" calculation is derived by dividing 100 miles by the "Cost to Drive 100 Miles" from the article.

| Scenario | Vehicle/Comparison | Fuel/Charge Type | Cost to Drive 100 Miles (from article) | Miles per Dollar (100 / Cost) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Best Case (Oklahoma)** | **Tesla Model 3 (EV)** | Home Charging | $2.73 | **36.63 miles/$** |
| (Efficient EV, Lowest Electricity Rate) | **BMW 330i (ICE)** | Regular Gas (Combined) | $8.90 | 11.24 miles/$ |
|  | BMW 330i (ICE) | Premium Gas (Combined) | $11.00 | 9.09 miles/$ |
| **Average Case (U.S. Average)** | **Chevy Equinox EV** | Home Charging | $5.13 | **19.49 miles/$** |
| (Typical EV, U.S. Average Prices) | **Chevy Equinox (ICE)** | Regular Gas (Combined) | $11.63 | 8.60 miles/$ |
|  | **Chevy Equinox EV** | Fast Charging (Low End) | $7.90 | 12.66 miles/$ |
|  | Chevy Equinox EV | Fast Charging (High End) | $23.69 | 4.22 miles/$ |
| **Worst Case (Hawaii)** | **GMC Hummer EV** | Home Charging | $30.36 | **3.29 miles/$** |
| (Inefficient EV, Highest Electricity Rate) | **F-150 Raptor R (ICE)** | Premium Gas (Combined) | $40.92 | 2.44 miles/$ |
|  | GMC Hummer EV | Fast Charging (Low End) | $36.37 | 2.75 miles/$ |
|  | GMC Hummer EV | Fast Charging (High End) | $48.99 | 2.04 miles/$ |
|  | F-150 Raptor R (ICE) | Premium Gas (Highway) | $32.73 | **3.06 miles/$** |

### Key Takeaways from the Table:

- **Home Charging Advantage:** In nearly all home charging scenarios, the EV provides significantly more miles per dollar than its ICE counterpart. The most dramatic difference is in the best case (Tesla Model 3 vs. BMW 330i), where the EV is over **three times** more efficient per dollar.
- **Fast Charging Cost:** The cost-effectiveness of an EV drops dramatically when using high-rate DC fast charging. In the average case, a high-rate fast charge ( vs. 8.60 miles/$).
- **Worst-Case Crossover:** In the worst-case scenario (Hummer EV vs. F-150 Raptor R in Hawaii), the ICE vehicle's highway efficiency (3.06 miles/) at the low-end rate.
