### I pick out winners and losers in my latest culture briefing paper

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb299ff89-f16b-47d3-8836-1345bec0f009_2400x800.jpeg)

Legacy institutions don’t want to tell you about the decline of legacy institutions. Can you blame them?

But this is the most important story in culture right now, and it’s too big to hide. For the last hundred years, power got centralized in a few hands—in media, entertainment, and arts. Now they are losing ground, and small indie operators are rising.

That’s the main theme in my latest culture briefing below. But I cover other breaking stories too.

Let’s start with Hollywood, where they don’t need a *Titanic* reboot—because they *are* the *Titanic* reboot!

### Disney is allegedly trying to sell the *Star Wars* franchise—but nobody wants to buy it.

This is [just a rumor](https://thatparkplace.com/disney-sell-star-wars/) (so far). But it sounds plausible.

> Disney has been quietly looking to sell *Star Wars* for the past seven months—but reportedly, there have been no takers.

This comes from [Chris Gore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkVBCp_VOw), who cites a “trusted individual” in the “world of finance” as his informant.

> I like to be very careful about breaking news because I don’t want to turn into one of those gossip sites. But we hear things….I am told from a friend in the industry that Disney has been shopping *Star Wars* for sale. They have been shopping the brand, they have been putting feelers out for the last seven months…. It’s unclear whether they are selling *Star Wars* or Lucasfilm. Is it the whole thing? I don’t know.

This sounds like a shocking move. But is it really?

Disney has been struggling for years now—just look at the trending share price. Did it hit an iceberg?

I was once a shareholder, but I bailed in early 2022. I certainly have no regrets.

They clearly need to change direction at the House of the Mouse. Flooding the market with more franchise films is no solution—it’s the problem. The studio has such a bad track record with franchises now, that the media calls them failures even before the movies come out.

So when *The Hollywood Reporter* did a teaser on the new *Snow White* film, the best they could say is “They Need to Get This Over With.”

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2ea4a11-0d5a-4fff-b44c-6f3cbc5bb262_1144x838.png)

I don’t expect to see *that* blurb in the ad campaign.

When things get this bad, half-measures aren’t enough. So I wouldn’t be surprised if Disney unloaded a big brand or took some other bold move.

Just consider: If they keep doing more of the same, those franchises will be worth even less five years from now. It’s better to find a life boat now.

And it’s not just Disney….

### Will the movie business ever return to pre-pandemic levels?

There is no recovery in sight. Even the *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* love coupling now looks like a forgotten one-night stand.

Not long, Hollywood routinely sold more than $10 billion in tickets per year. That’s now an impossible dream. Box office receipts are more likely to drop to $5 billion than get back to $10 billion.

Look at the chart below, and see for yourself.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe383961e-16f5-4c86-8f2c-1eea582e6ce3_1178x828.png)

### Meanwhile outsiders are thriving—and not just in filmmaking.

In this context, I note that a new [Chinese animated film generated $2 billion](https://deadline.com/2025/03/ne-zha-2-box-office-china-hollywood-analysis-1236324438/) in revenues. And it just got released on January 29.

But outsiders are also shaking up the culture closer to home: Substack announced last week that it grew 25% in just the last four months.

> ## I anticipate a future when Substack is a full-service platform for *all* indie creatives.

Who could have guessed that the hottest trend in culture would be reading long form articles by indie authors? But it’s happening.

*[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/substack-number-subscribers-video-trump-1236158048/)* [tells us](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/substack-number-subscribers-video-trump-1236158048/):

> Substack is seeing explosive paid subscription growth this year, with the crazy political environment and a strategic push into audio and video helping it do so.
> 
> Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie tells *The Hollywood Reporter* that the platform has passed 5 million paid subscriptions. That is up from 4 million just four months ago, and 3 million a year ago.

We’re still not ready to conquer Hollywood here. But Substack is adding new video tools:

> A year ago, Substack says that half of its top 250 creators used audio and video as part of their regular content. Now that number is 82 percent, underscoring just how much audio and video content have transformed the platform.

I anticipate a future when Substack is a full-service platform for *all* indie creatives. We already have the foundation here, and writers are well served. But we still need a few more tools for musicians, filmmakers, visual artists, and others.

Just last week somebody told me that Substack should get into video games—maybe set up a subscription service—because the dominant companies don’t reward their creative talent fairly.

I don’t know gaming well enough to pass judgment. But I suspect this is true.

And there are so many other opportunities.

Substack is obviously moving rapidly, but it still may take five years or more to really tap into the larger opportunity. We will look back years from now at a time when the platform had *only* five million paid subscriptions, and consider it the *infancy* of Substack.

Ten million or twenty million paid subscriptions (or more) are inevitable for a global platform of this sort. At least, that’s how I see it.

And indie operators of all stripes (not just writers) deserve a better, fairer system.

Meanwhile, Hollywood faces still another problem….

### One-star movie reviews are on the rise.

There are so many signs of audience fatigue with Hollywood. For a start the Oscars got lousy ratings—probably because the films honored had generated little enthusiasm among the general public.

Now Daniel Parris of [Stat Significant](https://www.statsignificant.com/) (one of our favorite culture data analysts) reports on a steady rise in the number of one star (or worse) reviews by moviegoers.

For years, the trendline was stable. But something shifted right before the pandemic. Since then negativity has been on the rise.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ea8388-1821-4151-824b-0842159ed093_1456x1054.webp)

[Source](https://www.statsignificant.com/p/which-movies-do-people-love-to-hate)

This is still a fixable problem. The naysayers are still a small cadre. But this trend is clearly not reversing. If anything, it appears to be accelerating.

### Lost David Bowie recordings are found through sheer chance.

Philadelphia record collector Max Ochester got quite a surprise recently.

In 2022, he acquired stack of reel-to-reel tapes that had been sitting in a foreclosed house in the suburbs. They gathered dust in 40 cardboard boxes, and appeared to contain Philadelphia soul music from the 1970s.

One box tape of tapes was unmarked, except for the single word “scrap”—so he assumed they were blank. He planned to re-use them, but decided to listen first to make sure there wasn’t any music on the tapes.

On one of them, he heard an R&B jam which relied on a guitar riff reminiscent of David Bowie’s “Fame.” That caught his attention. Then he heard versions of two songs from Bowie’s *Young Americans* that were different from the released tracks.

He soon realized that he had stumbled upon lost tapes from the sessions for that recording—which had been made at the Sigma Sound studio in Philadelphia back in 1974.

The tracks featured Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, Luther Vandross, David Sanborn, and others. This music was different from both the finished album, and anything on the surviving session tapes.

Ochester consulted with music producer Aaron Levinson, [who was amazed at the discovery](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/david-bowie-lost-recording-found-young-americans/#selection-4029.171-4029.328).

> The likelihood of finding original, unreleased David Bowie studio recordings, that no one has ever heard before, from 50 years ago, is almost zero….This is a priceless find.

### The Greek gods are coming back.

I’m not sure what to make of this. But a new temple for worshippers of Zeus, Pan, and other ancient deities just opened in the mountains of West Greece.

According to one source, [this is the first new temple to the Greek gods in 1700 years](https://wildhunt.org/2025/03/first-hellenic-polytheist-temple-in-1700-years-is-open-and-encounters-aggressions.html).

I saw some photos on Facebook, and am convinced that this will be good for tourism. Fans of burnt sacrifice don’t have many other options.

In the meantime, be on the lookout for lightning bolts and satyrs.

### What do tech leaders really think about AI?

The CEOs of Silicon Valley are totally committed to AI—or so they claim. But in private, they may be taking a more cautious stance.

Microsoft is an absolute puzzle. The company claimed in January that it would [spend $80 billion on AI data centers](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html)—and just a few days ago the CEO [asserted his confidence in AI](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-says-overbuild-ai-180936167.html) (but in very ambiguous words).

So you may have seen headlines like this:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6810209-fcd7-4828-830a-b0040f94bb58_2038x466.png)

[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html)

But [Ed Zitron has been digging deeper](https://www.wheresyoured.at/power-cut/) into this matter and shares key details from a [TD Cowen report](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andy-davis-3683337_breaking-news-td-cowan-reports-microsoft-activity-7299693594322325504-Vog_/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAAmuuF4BvsgagH4Z8-Z8-0LaBPPY6467cAs) that were “missed by just about everybody”:

> We learned via our channel checks that Microsoft
> 
> 1. walked away from multiple +100MW deals in multiple markets that were in early/mid-stages of negotiations,
> 2. let +1GW of letters of intent on larger footprint sites expire, and
> 3. walked away from at least five land parcels that it had under contract in multiple Tier 1 markets.

[Zitron adds this commentary](https://www.wheresyoured.at/power-cut/):

> What TD Cowen is saying is not just that "Microsoft canceled some data centers," but that Microsoft also **effectively canceled over a gigawatt of data center operations** on top of the previously-reported "multiple +100W megawatt deals.”…..
> 
> \[The company\] has effectively abandoned data center expansion equivalent to over 14% of its current capacity.

This is not what poker players do with a strong hand.

In Texas Hold ‘Em, we call this a *bluff*. Microsoft talks tough—but is taking chips off the table.

It’s just a matter of time before this becomes widely recognized— and imitated by others. The last player to recognize AI over-investment will be the biggest loser.

Meanwhile….

### AI slop is now destroying huge web platforms.

Pinterest “was a pretty good place to find genuine art from artists,” a site user [recently told a journalist](https://futurism.com/pinterest-ai-slop). But not anymore. “It's just like finding needles in haystacks now for real art.”

“I couldn't find a single human!!" another user complained. “Is this platform dead?”

It might be. And the murderer is AI slop—which is flooding the platform.

[According to](https://futurism.com/pinterest-ai-slop) *[Futurism](https://futurism.com/pinterest-ai-slop)*:

> Slop is everywhere on Pinterest, frequently ranking in the top results for common searches….But SEO spammers powering Pinterest's slopageddon say they're raking in cash…..We found AI seeping into the top results for nearly every search we attempted, from "gothic architecture" to "fantasy concept art."

Meanwhile spammers brag that they can make $10,000 per month with AI slop posts on Pinterest. These link to blogs filled with more slop and lots of ads.

Not long ago, I visited Pinterest, and even had my own account there. But I’ve now abandoned it as one more dying mall on the web.

### A new Frank Lloyd Wright house just opened. Or maybe not

This beloved American architect died in 1959. But in January, a brand new home by Frank Lloyd Wright appeared in Ohio. You can even stay there for $800 per night.

How did this happen?

[According to](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/new-frank-lloyd-wright-house-ohio-2619062) *[Artnet](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/new-frank-lloyd-wright-house-ohio-2619062)*:

> It so happens that a modest Ohio home for an art teacher and his wife was literally on the drawing board at the time of \[Wright’s\] death, in April 1959….This past January, a house based on those designs, dubbed RiverRock, rose at 2217 River Road in Willoughby Hills, Ohio, 20 minutes east of downtown Cleveland.

The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation rejects this project—[and all other posthumous structures like it](https://franklloydwright.org/unbuilt-works-policy/). But the building looks very striking.

In an era of cookie-cutter culture, I find this refreshing. I’ll always choose a dead genius who defied convention over bots that regurgitate it.

That’s all for now. I’ll be back soon with more.
