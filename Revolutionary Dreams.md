  
i used to dream militant  
dreams of taking  
over america to show  
these white folks how it should be  
done  
i used to dream radical dreams  
of blowing everyone away with my perceptive powers  
of correct analysis  
i even used to think i'd be the one  
to stop the riot and negotiate the peace  
then i awoke and dug  
that if i dreamed natural  
dreams of being a natural  
woman doing what a woman  
does when she's natural  
i would have a revolution
