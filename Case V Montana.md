## Case v Montana? What's the status

- Background: The Supreme Court added Case v. Montana to its docket for the 2025-2026 term, as noted in updates from SCOTUSblog. The case was among four cases added to the term’s docket, with the issue focusing on the constitutionality of warrantless home entry under the emergency-aid exception.
- Current Status: As of the latest available information (June 2, 2025), the case is scheduled for the Supreme Court’s next term, meaning it is in the pre-argument phase. No specific hearing date or decision has been reported yet, as the case is still pending oral arguments. The Court typically hears cases in the fall and issues decisions by the following summer, so a ruling is likely expected by mid-2026.

Clarification:

- Held v. Montana: This is a separate case where the Montana Supreme Court upheld a district court ruling on December 18, 2024, affirming that a state law prohibiting consideration of greenhouse gas emissions in environmental reviews violated the constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.

Next Steps:

- The Supreme Court’s website (www.supremecourt.gov) (www.supremecourt.gov) will provide updates on the docket and oral argument schedules for Case v. Montana.
