### Especially murdering people

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424)

**Preroll**

First, some thoughts on the rarity of thoughtful engagement, inspired by the low quality of pushback against Richard Hanania’s critiques of the MAGA right.

That Hanania's a provocateur with a taste for going against the grain isn't relevant. What's most interesting now about his 'stack is the reaction of his readers to articles like [Two Cheers for the Democratic Establishment?](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/two-cheers-for-the-democratic-establishment)

The first impulse of ideological team sport participants is to attack *that* a case is made, not what the case *is*.

I see what Hanania is doing. He already knows the failure modes of the leftish and that's less interesting to him than the failure modes of those with Trump Sycophancy Syndrome.

On the homeopathically-contrasting platform of Rarely Certain, being from the leftish, the failure modes of that camp are more interesting than banging on at the same targets I spent a lifetime jeering at.

These days I ignore anyone who cannot (or will not) steelman a position with which they disagree. Steelmanning isn't just useful cognitive practice for improving 'intellectual' rigour. If someone can't (or won't) articulate the most persuasive version of the case they wish to dismiss, all that results is a self-serving illusion of superiority.

The people in Hanania's comments and elsewhere who constantly make the argument that *if the right is bad, the left is worse* without engaging with their own side's manifest failings probably imagine that they're making a point when really they're defending against uncertainty, threat and cognitive dissonance.

This delusion of engagement says more about *them* and their identities than the issues at hand.

You can still engage without adopting the perspective that you reject, but this seems to happen rarely. People complaining that Hanania only ever attacks the right these days seem hellbent on not updating their wetware. They think they're reasoning, when really they're retreating and (I'd intuit) buttressing their identity.

As J.S. Mill said:

**“He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that”**

What makes Hanania interesting (if often annoying, in his delight at getting people riled up) is that he is critiquing his own historic camp. You know that he could steelman all their positions, having once held them himself. This is why I mostly discuss the failure modes of leftishism and its fetishes for credentialism, the moral vanity of expertise, stifling etiquettes, normative language patterns and the overall project's essential *soullessness*.

**On killing scapegoats**

Is Elias Rodriguez a psychopath? One presumes that he's agitated by death and suffering in Gaza. But did he think that murdering Sarah Lynn Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky would change the calculus in some way?

What does “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza” *mean*?

Written down, that question looks stupid because we don't tend to think about these things much. Perhaps we already subconsciously understand violence and scapegoating as a feature, rather than a bug, wherever people are organised into common belief groups. Maybe it’s just a hidden prior. That which is obvious to everyone doesn't seem to need explanation.

We might find comfort in the notion that acts like this are aberrations; manifestations of particularly intemperate personalities, perhaps even diagnosable as personality disorder.

Safe to say I'd rather that Rodriquez *were* diagnosed with something from the DSM. You gun two people down, reload your weapon and then finish them off while one is crawling away. *There will always be psychopaths*, is a good cope.

We saw the same kind of situation when Luigi Mangione murdered Brian Thompson.

\[You can drop a small donation my way via that button, or you can support Rarely Certain over time there, for 40% less than via Substack. All support is reciprocated by lifting the paywall for you\]

All of this steers me back to René Girard's theories of mimetic desire, violence and scapegoating. And the obvious absence of redemptive power in political ideologies, which has been the raison d'être of Rarely Certain for nearly 5 years.

Lately I've been reading about the French Revolution and wondering how an advanced modern state like the one I'm in can seriously *celebrate* Bastille Day and the wave of murder that followed.

> Let’s march, let’s march
> 
> That their impure blood
> 
> Should water our fields

It might seem ironic that The Marseillaise - an ode to wanton killing and gore - was written by a monarchist but adopted by revolutionaries, but maybe it isn't.

René Girard's suggestion was that any ideological system must contain a scapegoat mechanism as a channel for violence.

This isn't confined to extreme or revolutionary ideologies. It includes the sacralising of 'liberal democracy' as much as the combative identity or 'struggle' politics of race or nation, fundamentalist progressivism, MAGA 'Trumpism' or any other idea which promises salvation or collective transformation.

Girard called such belief systems "religions without God". (Incidentally, I never understood the crucifixion in Christianity until reading Girard)

I wonder if the Rodriquezes and Mangiones of our time are less autonomous random actors and more instruments of a social mechanism they neither understand nor control.

Perhaps they are not exceptions or aberrations, but embodiments of the kind of violence Girard saw as structurally necessary when mimetic rivalries escalate without resolution.

In such crises, when desires converge in conflict, the community -consciously or not - seeks to restore order by projecting its chaos onto a victim. Any victim will do, as long as they are sufficiently symbolically charged.

The obviousness of these victims - a Jewish couple, when Israel is implacably degrading an enemy's ability to mount pogroms, or a rich health insurance boss in a country where healthcare is unaffordable to many - is kind of misleading.

What unites them is not personal guilt, but their suitability as scapegoats onto whom collective tensions can be discharged. They absorb the pressure of unresolved mimetic contagion. Their murders offer the illusion of catharsis.

In this sense, murders like those are *ritualistic*.

ISIS did this all the time and we simply attributed it to vengeful feelings and religious fervour. This perhaps made them more relatable.

Maybe it's the recurrence of what Girard called the *founding violence*, reenacted as ritual without understanding.

Here's where the subtlety and depth of Girard is sometimes missed. It's tempting to leave it there by just accepting that feelings build up, need releasing and that the sacrifice of a scapegoat provides the valve.

But what Girard is saying is that such violence unites a community by redirecting rivalry - 'mimetic conflict' - toward the scapegoat.

It restores a previous, more harmonious state.

Here's how he describes the process.

Girard saw desire as mediated, rather than arising within ourselves. We want what others want. This causes competition and envy.

Eventually everyone is imitating everyone else through mimetic contagion. There is no way to regulate these harmonised desires and conflict emerges, so the community faces instability and risks disintegration.

This is when a scapegoat is needed. Someone symbolically marked but sufficiently marginal to be expended. Say, a Jewish couple in Washington DC, or a rich healthcare boss hardly anyone has heard of.

And here's where Girard makes for uncomfortable reading, if you want there to be an obvious *rational* rhyme and reason for everything.

He says that the killing restores order in the community suffering internal tension through rivalry. But that the process by which this is achieved is essentially irrational.

Communities fixated on injustice imagine themselves united by a shared moral cause.

So, where might the mimetic rivalry lie that scapegoating (temporarily) resolves?

Under the skin of every community lies a dense web of mimetic desire. Members unconsciously compete for righteousness, moral clarity, emotional relief, and the elevated status that comes with being on the right side.

What presents itself as collective solidarity is often, in Girardian terms, the space for a crisis of sameness, where everyone wants the same role as virtuous sufferer or maybe moral avenger.

Eventually the rivalry must be projected outward, to resolve community tension. A scapegoat is then sacrificed.

The sacrifice doesn't resolve the external problem but provides a brief internal group catharsis.

Violence does not always involve physical killing. Many have pointed to cancellation as a form of scapegoating, with group tensions cathartically released by turning on seemingly random individuals. [I previously noticed this too](https://www.rarelycertain.com/p/culture-war-groupishness-seems-to).

You don't have to shoehorn every act of ideologically-motivated violence into the frame of Girardian scapegoating. The likes of Rodriquez and Mangione clearly have personal incentives, such as community clout, feeling like they heroically sacrificed themselves for a 'higher' cause and maybe even psychic relief from getting some of that cloying hatred out of their system. Mangione now has a coterie of female admirers writing to him in prison.

His Wikipedia page includes a photo of graffiti in Marseille, France, which reads

> "Luigi Mangione hero of the people"

That’s worth *something*.

Scapegoating, in Girard's sense, involves the unconscious selection of a victim whose elimination restores unity to a community fractured by mimetic rivalry. But ideological violence can just be punitive or performative too. It [may even be designed to accelerate rather than resolve conflict](https://www.rarelycertain.com/p/faster-faster-til-it-breaks).

Like all human and social behaviours, it's layered.

But, if Girard wasn't hallucinating a crazy idea, the scapegoat mechanism may still be operating as one layer among several.

What's the point here?

When people get murdered for their symbolic value it suggests a current of ritualistic primitive thought among apparently normal people like Rodriquez and Mangione and those who celebrate (or blithely overlook) their actions.

Seeing them as aberrations - people who just take their convictions too far - may be comforting, partly because it overlooks the possibility that such behaviour is a feature rather than a bug. It removes us from the equation.

The *feature*, according to Girard, is the violence that arises from intra-group tensions and gets focused on a symbolic scapegoat.

I'm unsettled by Girard's suggestion that all our desires are mediated - copied from others - because it rings personally true, from observation *and* introspection (especially through meditation). And how mimetic desire seems especially concentrated around moral and symbolic objects like justice, purity and victimhood.

It's partly why I parted company with the hegemonic leftishist mindset of rights and justice, to pursue a personal [telos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos) rather than agitate for external influence.

I glimpsed the anger of groupishness because meditation practice revealed that it had filled me with the poison of disdain for ordinary people who have done me no harm.

If you think about it, when part of an ideological group, you can always locate yourself on one of these three planes, identified by Nathalie Martinek in [her recent piece on feminism](https://www.hackingnarcissism.com/p/toxicfem):

> **Active assimilation**, whereby you deliberately adopt the dominant tone, stance, and language to gain access and protection.
> 
> **Partial assimilation**, whereby you mimic the dominant culture just enough to be tolerated, but never fully accepted.
> 
> **Passive assimilation**, whereby you don’t even realise it’s happening. You’ve internalised the norms so well you think they’re your own.

Who knows what the numbers might be, but the real scapegoating instinct probably comes from the active assimilators, competing for access and protection, in a Girardian sense.

There's comfort in assimilation but I'd rather be sniffed at for what Girard called 'political atheism' than parrot what's approved by others.

Political atheism is another useful Girardian concept.

It's a refusal to believe that political progress toward a desired end state rids us of suffering and violence.

Inherent in every political ideology is the assumption that the removal of certain oppressors, implementation of a certain idea of justice and having the right leaders will bring peace. But Girard warns that purging - often through the scapegoat mechanism - always follows. I'm hard-pressed to think of exceptions where this isn't immediately obvious.

There's no way to patch the system because it's the human condition.

Back to Rodriquez and Mangione. If they want peace in the Middle East and affordable comprehensive health cover for everyone, killing Sarah Lynn Milgrim, Yaron Lischinsky and Brian Thompson hasn't advanced those causes.

That this disconnection between action and affect is overlooked in mainstream chatter seems weird, if you think about it for more than 2 seconds.

If they were both obvious morons it might suffice to use the excuse of principled passions riding high, but neither seems to be obviously compromised in that way.

This is what unsettles me about ideologically-adjacent violence. It doesn't make sense without an explicit mechanism connecting the perpetrator's motives and the victim's value to the enterprise.

Oddly, for an entirely theoretical construct, Girard's account of scapegoating to relieve the tensions that accumulate with mimetic rivalry does as well as any other answer in accounting for it in rational terms.

Then you want to hope that you aren't next.

**Afterthought**

I have to guard against a personal tendency to want one shiny intellectual object to represent a unifying theory. It would be great to be able to say *ah, that's why that thing happened*, but reducing deeply layered happenings to just one factor (especially a subconscious one) leaves too many other accounts untouched.

I’m also wary of anything that isn’t falsifiable and it’s difficult to imagine how one would go about proving or disproving theories like these. But they do provide some scaffolding where naïve A>B reasoning inevitably falls short of providing clear-cut accounts of cause and effect.

You can’t ‘prove’ much about what Epictetus said, either.

Ideas and frames matter, when simple reasoning and evidence cannot account for everything.

There’s a naïve conception of *reason* which places it apart from the user’s mind. It’s typically spoken of as a tool you can pick up and master, when the observable reality is that reason itself is obviously shaped by hidden desires and fears.

Part of Girard’s thinking is that in the real world, ‘rational argument’ often arrives only after the real decisions have already been made, in imitation, emotion, fear of exclusion and our conceptions of who we are.

The value of Girard's theory of mimetic violence isn't that it’s a slam-dunk on why random Jews and healthcare executives are sometimes murdered by randomers. It's that mimetic desire may form part of a web of effects, the better understanding of which helps make sense of how certain things come to happen as they do.
