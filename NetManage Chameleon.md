Once in the early 90s, if you wanted Windows to run TCP/IP you had to purchase that stack separately. Can you name some of the network vendors in the days before Windows 95?

In the early 1990s, before Windows 95 integrated TCP/IP natively in 1995, Microsoft Windows (3.x and Windows for Workgroups 3.11) shipped with only basic NetBEUI and IPX/SPX support for local networking. To add TCP/IP for internet or UNIX connectivity, you needed a third-party stack. These were sold as add-on products, often on floppy disks, and were provided by networking hardware and software vendors.Here are some of the major network vendors that offered TCP/IP stacks for Windows in the pre-Windows 95 era (roughly 1990–1995):Major TCP/IP Stack Vendors
1. FTP Software
	- Product: PC/TCP
	- One of the most popular and widely used. Included utilities like FTP, Telnet, and NFS client. Often bundled with network cards.
2. NetManage
	- Product: Chameleon (later ChameleonNFS)
	- A full-featured suite with TCP/IP, NFS, and email (SMTP/POP). Known for its graphical interface and ease of use.
3. Frontier Technologies
	- Product: SuperTCP (and SuperTCP/NFS)
	- Competitive with PC/TCP; included Winsock support in later versions.
4. Beame & Whiteside Software
	- Product: BW-Connect (formerly NFS-Connect)
	- Focused on NFS and TCP/IP for Windows, especially in UNIX integration environments.
5. Sun Microsystems (SunSelect)
	- Product: PC-NFS
	- Primarily an NFS client, but included a full TCP/IP stack. Popular in mixed Windows/UNIX environments.
6. Walker Richer & Quinn (WRQ)
	- Product: Reflection Network Series
	- Included TCP/IP with terminal emulation (TN3270, etc.) and NFS. Targeted at enterprise users.
7. Distinct Corporation
	- Product: Distinct TCP/IP
	- A lightweight, reliable stack often used in embedded or OEM setups.
8. LAN Manager (Microsoft/3Com/others)
	- While Microsoft co-developed LAN Manager with 3Com and IBM, third-party LAN Manager TCP/IP add-ons (e.g., from 3Com or HP) provided TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups.
9. Trumpet Software
	- Product: Trumpet Winsock
	- A shareware Winsock DLL that became hugely popular in 1994–1995. Not a full stack vendor like the others, but critical for early internet apps (Mosaic, Netscape). Ran on top of packet drivers or existing stacks.
10. Novell
	- Provided TCP/IP support via LAN WorkPlace or NetWare NFS, though Novell’s focus was IPX/SPX. Their TCP/IP was more common on NetWare servers than Windows clients.
Network Card Vendors (Often Bundled Stacks) Many NIC manufacturers bundled TCP/IP software to make their cards "internet-ready":
- 3Com – Bundled FTP Software’s PC/TCP or their own stack.
- SMC (Standard Microsystems) – Bundled SuperTCP or Chameleon.
- Intel – Partnered with FTP Software.
- D-Link, Linksys, etc. – Often included Trumpet Winsock or basic stacks.
The Transition: Winsock and Windows 95 By 1994, the Winsock standard (Windows Sockets API) unified application access to TCP/IP, allowing apps like web browsers to work across different stacks. Trumpet Winsock became a de facto standard for dial-up users.When Windows 95 launched in August 1995, it included:
- Built-in TCP/IP
- Dial-Up Networking
- Winsock 1.1
- PPP support
This effectively killed the third-party TCP/IP stack market overnight.

Summary: In the early '90s, FTP Software, NetManage, Frontier Technologies, Beame & Whiteside, and Sun PC-NFS were the dominant players in the Windows TCP/IP add-on market.
