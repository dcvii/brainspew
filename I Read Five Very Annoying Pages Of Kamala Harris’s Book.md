### (And discovered an extremely dumb error)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCoi!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feead35e5-8669-4969-af8b-2559666117b1_1024x683.jpeg)

I have always thought Kamala Harris is a deeply unimpressive politician. But the circumstances of her ~~2020~~ 2024 \[**UPDATE:** jfc, Jesse…\] run were so unfair and so unusual that part of me remained a bit ambivalent. I was mostly off of Kamala Island but I was lingering in the surf, perhaps a single foot still technically ashore. I could have potentially been lured back if there was a really big cookout or something.

But now that I have read a grand total of five pages of her book *[107 Days](https://www.amazon.com/107-Days-Kamala-Harris/dp/1668211653)*, sent to me by a helpful individual who has a copy, picture me speeding away in a cool 1980s neon Jet Ski, drunk, going way too fast, praying for the appearance of an oil tanker on the horizon so I can pilot straight into it, the resultant flash of diesel and saltwater ending, mercifully and permanently, my ability to conceptualize concepts like “The 2020s Democratic Party... ”

...

Okay, I stepped away from my laptop, did some breathwork, and calmed down a bit. I’m back and I promise to be more respectful and balanced. *Fair* and balanced, as it were.

The chapter in question, titled “October 15 – 21 Days to the Election,” concerns one explanation for Harris’s loss: her supposed weakness on gender-identity issues, which gave rise to the Donald Trump campaign’s (apparently very successful) [“Kamala is for they/them”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_is_for_they/them) ad.

Harris, in attempting to rehabilitate her image after a devastating loss (albeit one that, again, mostly wasn’t her fault), flees not away from but *toward* the trope of the weaselly, nervous, tryhard politician who refuses to take stands on anything lest they insult anyone. I can’t decide which meme applies more: [Dril turning his “racism” meter up and down](https://x.com/dril/status/841892608788041732) in a desperate bit for approval (except it’s marked “trans rights” instead) or [this famous sequence](https://youtu.be/HRJsTQFTEZ8?si=RrCGJTrAfXO013EO&t=236) from The Simpsons involving a pair of aliens, Kang and Kodos, body-snatching the bodies of the 1996 U.S. presidential candidates.

> Kang \[impersonating Bob Dole\]: Abortions for all!
> 
> Crowd: *Booooooo!*
> 
> Kang: Very well. No abortions for anyone!
> 
> Crowd: *Booooooo!*
> 
> Kang \[slightly confused\]: Hmmm. Abortions for some, miniature American flags for others!
> 
> Crowd: Yaaaaaay! \[with some waving of American flags\]

In the chapter, we learn that right as the bump of her entrance into the campaign was wearing off and Trump had pulled back even with her, the they/them ads started popping off:

> And then, like most guys who watch a lot of sports, \[her husband\] Doug started seeing the trans ads. No matter what he was watching—football, baseball—there they were. The Trump campaign would eventually spend as much as $40 million on those ads. They showed some version of it fifty-five thousand times in the seven swing states. They showed it in all fifty states during sport broadcasts.

Harris was not thrilled with how the ad handled the issue of trans women in women’s sports:

> Gabrielle Ludwig, the basketball player featured prominently in the ad, was at home in Nevada watching an Eagles game when she was astonished to see herself, in a photograph that had been taken twelve years earlier. She was fifty-two at the time of that photo. A registered Republican, she’d served eight years in the Navy and had gone to community college later in life, as many veterans do. She’s a big woman, but she also looks strikingly different from her teammates because she’s three decades older than they are, which had never been the athletic advantage the ad implied.

I think my main problem with this paragraph is that it is treating me, the reader — yes, I am taking this personally — like I’m dumb.

I guess we have to begin with the ad itself, including the image in question. I want to be clear that I have no interest in beating up on Gabrielle Ludwig, who didn’t break any rules, and that her name never would have come up in this newsletter if she hadn’t appeared in Trump’s ad and if Harris hadn’t issued such an incredibly weak response in her book.

Here’s the image in question, in context:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1-86!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ecbb1a9-219c-4420-a245-b9b3a1d5be15_507x449.png)

Ludwig is a trans woman who, back when she was college-aged, played a bit of men’s college basketball. Then, three months after surgery, she walked onto a low-level women’s college basketball team in 2012, in her early 50s.

If you know anything about basketball, you know that the reason Ludwig was able to pull this off is because men are, on average, much bigger, taller, and stronger than women. No man, anywhere, is playing college basketball on a *men* ’s team at that age, or even in his forties. The athletic drop-off is that swift. Ludwig, according to contemporaneous reports, was something like 6’6”, 230 pounds (her height and weight were listed differently in different places). [The average size of a](https://jokermag.com/average-height-wnba-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) *[professional](https://jokermag.com/average-height-wnba-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)* [women’s basketball player](https://jokermag.com/average-height-wnba-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), today, is a bit under 6’1”, and [a solid majority of WNBA players are under 200 pounds](https://stats.wnba.com/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER_WEIGHT&dir=1). Height is important in basketball, but weight isn’t far behind, because if you are large, people bounce off of you when you are close to the hoop. If you are small, bigger players can send you flying or can serve as brick walls between you and the basket.

Because of Ludwig’s overwhelming sex-based size and strength advantage relative to both whoever’s slot she took and the competition, she was able to walk onto that team and carve out a role, and generate some human-interest stories back before transgender issues were nationally controversial. “She also takes pride now in not just being able to compete at a high level — leading the team in scoring with 17 points a game and leading the state in rebounding with 18 a game — but in helping mentor even her opponents,” [noted ESPN](https://www.espn.com/espnw/athletes-life/story/_/id/10170842/espnw-gabrielle-ludwig-52-year-old-transgender-women-college-basketball-player-enjoying-best-year-life). That’s an insane coincidence that she was somehow able to lead the entire state in rebounding despite being decades older than her opponents. Those are Bill Russell numbers!

Harris’s shruggery here is insulting. The problem isn’t that she’s a “big woman”; the problem is she’s male, and the [vast majority of Americans think trans women like her shouldn’t play on women’s teams](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/poll-americans-oppose-trans-women-competing-female-sports-2-3-gen-z-rcna203658). And the line “three decades older than they are, which had never been the athletic advantage the ad implied” is outright idiotic. No one’s saying that it’s an advantage to be older: What they’re saying is that her ability to play women’s college basketball at that age shows just how much of a fairness concern there is here!

Back to Harris’s book:

> Trump’s team wasn’t concerned with nuance. With the tagline “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” they thought they had landed on a winning message.
> 
> Unfortunately, they were right. Although not to the extent that has become conventional wisdom.

I had ChatGPT create a trophy for Harris:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS3m!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc947ebc6-26a1-48ad-bf5d-40f3467f14cf_1536x1024.png)

The problem for Harris is that the Democratic Party chose to go all-in on this issue and to pursue an unpopular, hard-line version of it. The third sentence of Joe Biden’s day-one executive order read: “Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports.” Because the EO concerned Title IX (in part), it wasn’t just about “children,” but about high schoolers and college students as well. The Democrats sought to include “gender identity” in “sex” as defined by Title IX. I say the whole party because for a while, their signature legislation was the Equality Act, [which would have literally rewritten](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5/text) the definition of sex to “includ\[e\] ‘sexual orientation’ and “gender identity.’ ”

Look, I get it: the Democrats lost, we’re now in the worst political hell in recent memory, Trump Trump Trump.

But the two aren’t disconnected! Nobody knows what the Democrats stand for, and Kamala Harris, in this chapter, shows that she’s a big part of the problem.

Soon she gets to ’splainin’ about her campaign-trail silence on this issue:

> Why didn’t I punch back harder? There are two things to talk about: one is people, one is politics. Let’s start with people. Transgender people are Americans, with the same rights we all have, to liberty, equality, the pursuit of happiness, and equal protection under the law.

She answers, except not really. Here’s what immediately follows:

> There aren’t very many. A tiny minority of less than 1 percent of the population.
> 
> Of these, in 2024, less than ten played on women’s college sports teams.
> 
> *Less than ten.*
> 
> The law says incarcerated people must be provided with medical care. Under that law, two federal prisoners have received court-ordered gender-affirmation surgery.
> 
> *Two.*
> 
> Very small numbers. But here are some bigger ones: Three hundred and fifty transgender people were murdered in America in 2024. Fifteen of them were kids.
> 
> Trans people are over four times as likely as other Americans to be victims of a violent crime.
> 
> Almost half—42 percent—have attempted suicide.

First off, the 350 statistic is a more than 8x overestimate of the number of trans people known to have been killed in the United States during that rough period. A five-second Google search uncovered the source of that 350 number: [a Human Rights Watch blog post](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/11/20/trans-day-remembrance-marked-grim-murder-data) that in turn points to the “the [Trans Murder Monitoring Project](https://tgeu.org/files/uploads/2024/11/TGEU-TMM-TDoR2024-Table-2.pdf), a global initiative of Transgender Europe (TGEU).”

That project reports that at least 350 trans people had been killed *worldwide* from the start of October 2023 to the end of September 2024 (so Harris didn’t get the timeline quite right either). Setting aside the fact that this is the only report that comes up when you search for the 350 statistics, further bolstering the case that this is her source is the fact that if you add up the reported murders in the 18-and-under brackets, you get 15:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nF3-!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9f8e1b2-5a72-4704-9b24-b7aa7c94c78f_914x442.png)

In the United States, there were 41 murders of transgender people in this period.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7M1d!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3da2750-0db9-41d7-b69c-dcf2355ca181_919x109.png)

Is Kamala Harris and her team’s inability to do a basic fact-check on something like this more compatible with A) her deep concern for trans people, or B) her desire to use catastrophizing rhetoric *about* trans people to both promote her career and rhetorically smokebomb her way out of taking any real stances on these issues? (The same goes for the zombie suicide statistic. See [here](https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/a-critique-of-scientific-americans) and search down to “Williams Institute.”)  
  
What’s remarkable is the way Harris, via a one-woman show, reenacts just about every toxic intraleft exchange about trans issues from over the last 10 years: Person A asks about a specific policy that the Democrats are promoting or have enacted, at which Person B yells “Why do you care! This doesn’t affect anyone! They are all killing themselves!”

This is particularly strange in light of the fact that Harris acknowledges the *they/them* act worked! Which means that at the very least, even if you’re arguing this is a fundamentally niche/unimportant issue (a niche and unimportant issue that sat near the top of your party’s domestic policy agenda for years and which was the subject of a day-one EO), you still need to figure out what your answer is to these questions!

So what are Harris’s answers to these questions?

On sports, Harris writes that she was misconstrued, somehow:

> The ad also said that I supported “biological men competing against our girls in their sports.” That’s not my position. I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and other athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports. With goodwill and common sense, I believe we can come up with ways to do this, without vilifying or demeaning children.

There’s a case to be made that the Trump campaign either lied about Harris’s position or misconstrued it. That part of the ad looked like this:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!G7nI!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0821862d-e45d-4cf1-98cc-55e2fcfee137_621x151.png)

There’s no evidence of a Politico article in which *Harris* endorsed this position. Rather, [there’s an article published that same date](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/28/biden-transgender-student-rights-463277) about Republican states passing laws that appear to be partly in response to Biden’s day-one E.O. So is this fair? Not really. On the other hand, Harris was [asked on](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/23/kamala-harris-the-view-00576639) *[The View](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/23/kamala-harris-the-view-00576639)* [in October 2024](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/23/kamala-harris-the-view-00576639) whether she’d have done anything differently from Biden and, remarkably, answered no. On the *other* other hand, [the they/them ads began appearing](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-goes-harris-anti-trans-ads-football-games-rcna174354) before she had taken that genius position.

On the fourth hand — perhaps the most important hand — if Harris disagreed with this position she could have just (freaking) *said so*, given that her apparent silence on this particular issue certainly left a vacuum that could be filled with misinformation. (The Biden administration eventually adopted a [compromise position](https://www.ecs.org/biden-administration-releases-proposed-rules-for-transgender-athlete-participation/) that would have left local authorities/bodies with some discretion to keep sports sex-based.)

But here’s where we’re at in the chapter: First Harris tuts at the fact that Trump sought to bring negative attention to a 52-year-old trans woman (a veteran! And a Republican!) who walked onto a female college team. I mean, who cares? What’s the big deal? Then Harris says she, personally, has concerns with... well, with this exact thing. With the biological advantages male athletes possess over female ones. Then she says there should be a compromise position. But then she doesn’t explain what that compromise position might look like.

She eventually concludes that the best political approach was to change the subject:

> The approach that worked best in our testing was to say, *Trump says a lot of things about me, but I know the thing you care about is the economy,* and quickly pivot to our messages on price gouging, affordable housing, and small-business tax relief. And that was the ad we ran in rebuttal in the swing states.

Except also, they could have done it differently, by figuring out some other (unspecified) way to counter the attacks:

> I do not regret my decision to follow my protective instincts. I do regret not giving even more attention to how we might mitigate Trump’s attacks.

Once Kamala Harris discovers that national politics is not her strong suit, I hope she becomes a spy. If she’s ever captured, it will be impossible for interrogators to get a single straight answer out of her about anything.

As mentioned in one of the above excerpts, the chapter references another controversy in a manner that is similarly redolent of bullshit. When Harris mentions “The law says incarcerated people must be provided with medical care,” she’s referencing the time, last September, when Andrew Kaczynski of CNN dug up and published an [ACLU questionnaire Harris](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/08/Harris-ACLU-Candidate-Questionnaire.pdf) had filled out in 2020.

[The first paragraph of his story](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/kfile-harris-pledged-support-in-2019-to-cut-ice-funding-and-provide-transgender-surgery-to-detained-migrants/index.html):

> In an American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire then-Sen. Harris filled out as a candidate for president in 2020, she also expressed support for decriminalizing federal drug possession for personal use, and for sweeping reductions to Immigration and Custom Enforcement operations, including drastic cuts in ICE funding and an open-ended pledge to “end” immigration detention.

Here’s Harris’s explanation:

> When I was AG in 2015, a state prisoner sued to get gender-affirming surgery. My client was the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and, as its lawyer, I was required to support the case against that inmate, which we settled in the inmate’s favor. In 2017 a transgender prisoner in California was the first to get gender-affirming surgery based on that case, and twenty-two others have followed in California. That’s the law.
> 
> But because I’d been on the opposing side of the case, a cry went up: *Kamala doesn’t care about trans people.*
> 
> That wasn’t true. I wanted to rebut that claim.
> 
> When the ACLU, in 2019, asked me to fill out a questionnaire, and one of the questions was about gender health care for incarcerated adults, I said I supported whatever was medically necessary. (Which is what the law says and what Donald Trump upheld as president. During his term, trans people in federal prison received the hormone treatments they were seeking.) I reiterated that view when asked in an interview. And that was what the Trump team sliced and diced for their ad.

I actually do think this is a far niche-ier concern. But what made the controversy potent was the idea of her supporting trans surgery for immigrant detainees. And her argument that she was just adhering to what the law requires makes no sense. After all, in filling out the ACLU questionnaire, she flitted freely between defending some laws and proposing to reform others. The whole point of running for president is to get to propose new laws and criticize existing ones!

It’s just the lack of any sort of political agility that gets to me. The obvious humane policy for immigrant detainees is that they should have access to their medications! So if someone is picked up on an immigration violation and they were on hormones, they should continue to have access to hormones. Forcing someone to physically detransition while locked up is grotesque. But Harris could have simply said that without also endorsing the policy of giving these detainees *surgery*! What is the number of immigration detainees who even *seek* surgeries? If it’s close to zero, which it might be, why not just exhibit a *bit* of compromise here and say that you don’t think the law should be stretched to include this population? Just throw something in about “fair and speedy resolution of immigration cases,” blah blah blah.

Instead, she just yes-ma’amed the ACLU, specifically mentioning surgeries in her response:

> It is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition. That’s why, as Attorney General, I pushed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide gender transition surgery to state inmates. I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained. Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment.

Overall, it’s simply demoralizing how little Kamala Harris actually *says* in this chapter about the cultural issue that probably did her the most harm on the campaign trail. She didn’t really stand for anything during the campaign, other than an attachment to a very unpopular incumbent that was somehow both vague and unequivocal, and then she comes across in exactly the same way in this chapter, like there’s no actual human underneath.

Here’s how Harris concludes the chapter:

> I wish I could have gotten the message across that there isn’t a distinction between “they/them” and “you.”  
>   
> The pronoun that matters is “we.” We the people. And that’s who I am for.

I mean this genuinely: This closing passage represents the absolute peak of Kamala Harris’s political talent and willingness to speak plainly and honestly.
