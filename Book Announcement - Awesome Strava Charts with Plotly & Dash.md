If your charts are an eyesore, it’s not your fault.

Data visualization is often treated as an afterthought, something to “get through” or “pick up along the way.” You don’t always spend the time needed to learn how to tell a compelling story with data. As a result, your charts blend in and you fail to deliver the message, no matter how valuable the information is.

**But that can change in just one afternoon.**

My new eBook teaches you how to create engaging visualizations using data that matters to you—not some generic dataset we’ve all seen before. Instead, you’ll work with your own (or my) Strava workout file.

In just a few hours, you’ll improve your data visualization skills and create charts that grab attention. You’ll finally be able to tell a strong, data-driven story that stands out.
