Q: What was the initial reason for allowing people the right to own guns in the US?


A: I am a Canadian foreigner and I'll explain it. Americans are welcome to correct me if I am mistaken.

Edit: (I am ignoring Spain in this answer for a reason). The first permanent English settlement in North America was Jamestown, Virginia, established in 1607.

Over the next one and three quarter centuries the colonists, being very different than typical Englishmen, found the rules, and oversight of their forebearers didn't align with who they had become. They were rugged, trail-blazers who had carved a path, and a new, young society out of a wilderness. The “civilization” of England didn't understand what it took to thrive in this new America. Firearms were a critical part of surviving and thriving in this new wilderness. Progressions of control were pushed by England onto these people.

Edit: (Brief Rant) As with all oppressive governments, preceding growing tyranny, governments confiscate firearms 

- 1911: Turkey; citizens disarmed – 1.5 million Armenians were slaughtered
- 1929: Russia; citizens disarmed – 20 million Russians murdered
- 1935: China; citizens disarmed – 20 million Chinese killed
- 1938: Germany; citizens disarmed – 6 million Jews murdered
- 1956: Cambodia; citizens disarmed – 1 million “intellectuals” killed
- 1964: Guatemala; citizens disarmed – 100,000 Mayan Indians massacred
- 1970: Uganda; citizens disarmed – 300,000 Christians put to death
- 2020 through 2025 Canadian Liberal government under the power of Justin Trudeau, begins massive firearm bans and confiscations… declaring what some call martial-law like measures, freezing the bank accounts of peaceful political opponent protesters, leaving multiple political prisoner protesters in jail for multiple years without a trial verdict, engaging in a campaign of disinformation with the state funded national news broadcaster, described by the free press as the actions of a brutish dictator, which was later determined by the federal court to be “illegal and against the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms”!

Edit: some Brits in the comments section tried to tell me the British didn't try to deny Americans firearms so I added details here…

The British attempted to remove American firearms and gunpowder:

- 1774 import banThe British Parliament passed a law banning the import of firearms and gunpowder into the colonies.
- ConfiscationsThe British confiscated firearms and gunpowder from individuals and local governments between 1774 and 1775.
- Warrantless searchesThe British began conducting warrantless searches and seizures of firearms in the Boston area in 1774.
- Powder AlarmIn September 1774, General Thomas Gage removed gunpowder from a powder magazine (a large storage building) in Charlestown, Massachusetts. This event led to the First Continental Congress calling for the colonies to organize militia companies.
- Seizure of arms at Lexington and ConcordIn 1775, the British attempted to seize the arms of the rebel militia at Lexington and Concord.

These were factors which lead to the War of Independence against England. And the creation of the Constitution and it's amendments.

Your question has a key misunderstanding of the right to tools of self determination. You see, the Constitution doesn't “allow” Americans the Right to Bear Arms. It declares that the Government Is Not Allowed to infringe upon Americans to continue to have arms. Since the time of rocks and sharp sticks, humans who survived to procreate have always been armed. You see, there is a Natural Right to protecting one's self and one's family. This can be referred to as the Right to PREPARED self defense.

The justification for the second amendment requires an understanding of only two facts:

1. Police do not have the ability to protect citizens in reasonable time. When seconds count, police are only minutes away. No free man or woman would consider not having tools for prepared self defense unless and until Police ever became flawless protectors. Those who don't wish to prepare to reasonably effectively protect their family have the choice to not bear arms, and cross their fingers, hoping defending their family will never be necessary, AND hope police arrive in time if it does. A protective “mother bear” or “father bear” would not relinquish their ability to hopefully, effectively, protect their family even in an unlikely chance of danger. Understand, “very unlikely” doesn't mean it “won't happen”!
2. The other fact supporting the Amendment declaring no government has the right to remove the access of tools of prepared self defense for it's citizens, is the logical and reasonable belief that governments can never be trusted with any absolute certainty. (November 2024) The polarization of two halves of the American people in recent federal elections makes this point clear. Half of America believes the new government will take away it's democracy, as the new leader is “Hitler”. And the other half of America believes the former government has been stealing it's people's tax money, giving it to illegal, unvetted immigrants, while trying to confuse and separate Americans by their race and WOKE politics.

The people are frightened. And the last thing a government can morally do is remove the ability of the countrie’s population to protect itself from a tyrannical government. There wouldn't be a United States of America if the tyrannical English government couldn't be beat back with arms by 1776.

My personal opinion: no loving parent would CHOOSE to not have tools at their disposal to protect their family. Farming out the protection of one's family to others, who are incapable of providing consistent and effective protection is simply not an option while the second amendment exists.

*Note: unfortunately the idiot photographer of the photograph with the “mother and child” below directed the “mother” to break the 3rd Rule of Firearm Safety.*

I believe children DESERVE to be protected even if you don't have the balls to do it. (Lady balls exist for some women - they are powerful, protective mothers) Get educated and live up to your obligations as a parent - where laws allow this.
