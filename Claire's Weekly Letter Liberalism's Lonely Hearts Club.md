🎉 CELEBRATING QUILLETTE'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY 🎉

This will be my final newsletter of the year. Managing Editor Iona Italia will be delivering the weekly letter over the holiday period, and I’ll see you again in the new year.

Last night in Sydney, we celebrated our tenth anniversary with local readers and supporters, as well as The Honourable Tony Abbott, former Prime Minister of Australia. Thanks to all of those who came (especially those who travelled long distances to be there!). It was a wonderful evening of warmth and community, and gave me the opportunity to pause and reflect on our company’s achievements.

As we celebrate this anniversary, I especially want to thank our loyal readers. Many of you have stayed with us for several years, and for that I am grateful. Creating an international publication that critiques illiberalism on both the left and the right is not easy; it is far easier to capitulate to tribalism, vested interests, and the lure of partisan capture. But with your support, we’ve been able to withstand these pressures and build a publication for which editorial independence remains our defining North Star.

This week, *Quillette's* Canadian editor, Jonathan Kay, argues that liberal institutions are drifting toward illiberalism from both left and right—and that defending free speech, scientific rigour, and due process is becoming an increasingly lonely but necessary position.

Standing up for due process, free speech, civil liberties, intellectual pluralism, and scientific rigour doesn’t win you many friends these days.

What happens when institutions trade neutrality and responsibility for moral performance? This week we feature an exposé of how Doctors Without Borders has blurred the line between humanitarian work and political activism in the Israel–Hamas conflict.
