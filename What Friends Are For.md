The third time the promotional brochure for the Continuing Care Retirement Community came in the mail, my husband and I took a few very deep breaths and decided to visit the apartment complex. The primary—no, the only—impetus for our interest was the prospect of sparing our children the burden of having to make decisions for us should we lose our wits along with our knees. The place wouldn’t open for at least three years. I will be 78 and my husband, 80—older but likely as appalled then as now by the idea of distancing ourselves from friends and life as we know it. I want to fish for friends in open water, not a goldfish bowl. And I want kids around. Anyone under 60 qualifies.

That’s the insupportable downside of a community that presumes commonality based solely on age. Our friendships are vital. Geriatric—nasty word—specialists convincingly insist that our friends are therapeutic; that social connections [stimulate the brain](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/3-ways-to-build-brain-boosting-social-connections-202109082585), help us [maintain cognitive function](https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-021-02531-0), [encourage physical activity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8716010/), and provide [crucial emotional support](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/27B597694C72769283D6E666939F7C15/S0144686X22000666a.pdf/friendships_loneliness_and_psychological_wellbeing_in_older_adults_a_limit_to_the_benefit_of_the_number_of_friends.pdf).

Even with years of varied experiences behind us, we have no experience at being This Age. It baffles. We’re as clueless as adolescents who cling to each other as they figure themselves out. Instead of parents, we have old age to rebel against, so we lock arms with our old friends, treasure the guidance of older friends, mourn their deaths, and seek younger friends to reliably divert the conversation away from interminable deliberations on failing health, memory loss, who died, or has the best doctors, and what magic potions prevent wrinkles and crepey skin.

My vision of a perfect arrangement is an apartment complex that won’t exclude us from chance encounters with youthful creatures foreign to these thoughts. The first floor will be devoted to children’s day care. On the upper floors dwell old people like us. The floors in between would house young couples and families (thus the day care facilities) whose rent would be partially subsidized by the old folks who live above them, thrilled by the possibility of exchange with their younger neighbors. With the slightest encouragement, we could be useful, make ourselves available for story hour and babysitting and sharing whatever talents we still possess. When our own children visit, they wouldn’t enter the bleakness of *[there but for fortune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6omDSxTCXE).*

Old friends are dependable but vulnerable. It’s not just death that depletes our ranks.

This pipe dream won’t be realized in my lifetime, so I attend to the friends and acquaintances at hand whose significance was underlined by Covid, when our isolation made getting and keeping in touch an essential exercise. We had to plan. Instead of lunches or dinner parties we scheduled FaceTime, reconnecting with friends whose physical distance had loosened our bond and no longer factored. I joined a monthly chat with Kate and Caleen, two college friends with whom I’d fallen out of regular touch. It was fascinating to learn about the lives we could not have envisioned 50 years ago when we sat in the darkened hallway between our dorm rooms talking into the night. We continued the conversation after the plague ended and this summer met in person to commemorate our jointly turning 75. Inevitably, we dedicated our first breakfast to listing the pills we take every morning and the parts of our bodies that complain the loudest. For the rest of our exquisite four days together the subject was tabled. Even after all these years—even after all these *decades* —we speak in shorthand, with understanding, sympathy, and perspective right on the surface. We carry each other forward with full knowledge of our pasts.

“They’re firing at our battalion,” said a friend we met at yet another memorial service. Old friends are dependable but vulnerable. It’s not just death that depletes our ranks. Even our best friends, newly cast as grandparents, may become so enmeshed in the lives of their adult children that they disappear from ours. How do we replace the friends we’ve lost when we lack the commonality of workplace, playing field, or car pool? Years after he’d regularly attended AA meetings a 78-year-old friend on the brink of loneliness decided to return, even though he hadn’t had a drink in years. He wasn’t worried that a lack of friendship might tempt him to drink. He was drawn by the recollection of companionship and support that the AA community had supplied.

We rely on our older friends to provide us with maps of the land mines ahead.

You may find new and younger friends in surprising places. Ana, a 26-year-old Ukrainian, and I began a conversation more than two years ago through [a program](https://www.enginprogram.org/) that matches volunteers with Ukrainians who want to improve their English. Our weekly hour-long conversations range from what it means to lose one’s homeland, to recipes, to how to live with constant anxiety. Ana says that sales of sleepwear have soared, as women want to look their best while racing to shelters in the middle of the night, and that [Russian drones](https://www.thefp.com/p/niall-ferguson-ive-seen-the-future) are a constant torment.

Signing up, signing on is regularly prescribed to alleviate the isolation that threatens to narrow our opportunities for connection. The old cliché of being a joiner, waving our (veined) hands like the eager kid with the answer, to volunteer or be admitted to a book club, church group, fantasy league, or knitting circle probably works, but it’s a crapshoot whether one of your new acquaintances will ask how you are and wait for your answer. How’s Viagra working for you? We need friends we can call on in a crunch.

Location may provide sufficient commonality. On Cape Cod, where we spend our summers, I join a group of women in their 50s and older to swim across a pond in the Wellfleet woods. The fact that few of us will be in touch during the offseason does not affect our conversation’s level of intimacy. We paddle to a raft on the far shore keeping our ears above water to hear complaints about the state of the world or our partners, insults, injustices, all the things we hate. When we swim back, we’re required to switch to a positive and optimistic frame of mind. Occasionally, when what might delight us is too far out of reach, we turn around and swim the distance twice.

My husband, who believes and admirably demonstrates that enduring friendship requires work, delivered his most recent memorial service eulogy to a man who’d been a friend for only 20 of his 92 years. Don entered our lives when he approached us after the Q&A following some long-forgotten library talk. He introduced himself and his wife saying: “You interest me. We’d like to get to know you.” Try that: a compliment to a stranger followed by an invitation.

We rely on our older friends to provide us with maps of the land mines ahead. My friend Dee, 15 years older than me, had helped me sort out a lifetime of intermittent crises, always taking my side. She had a way of applauding my accomplishments that made them seem almost miraculous. She enjoyed the photos I’d send of my garden when her visits became impossible. She showed me it was possible to *age gracefully.* My memory of her continues to enhance my appreciation of my garden and whatever else is before me. It takes a true friend to make you believe you’re better than you think and deserve the best of what life can offer. The gift of friendship becomes ever more precious as we worry that what we most admire in ourselves may slip away and life gradually withdraws its open hands.
